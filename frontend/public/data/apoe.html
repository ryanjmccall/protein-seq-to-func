<h1>APOE</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a key protein involved in lipid transport and metabolism, with significant implications
    for aging, neurodegenerative disease, and longevity. The APOE gene has three common alleles—ε2, ε3, and
    ε4—determined by single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions rs429358 and rs7412. The ε4 allele is a major genetic
    risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cardiovascular disorders, and reduced lifespan, while the ε2
    allele is associated with protective effects and increased longevity. The ε3 allele is considered neutral. APOE
    isoforms differ in structure and function, influencing lipid binding, receptor affinity, and disease susceptibility.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The APOE ε4 allele is associated with antagonistic pleiotropy: it confers early-life fitness advantages (e.g.,
        improved fertility, cognitive development, immune response) but increases risk for late-life diseases such as
        Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disorders.</li>
    <li>ε2 allele carriers show protective effects against Alzheimer’s disease and are enriched in long-lived
        individuals, suggesting a pro-longevity role.</li>
    <li>Functional effects of APOE isoforms are mediated through structural changes (e.g., C112R substitution), altered
        lipid binding, and disrupted receptor interactions, leading to impaired lipid transport and increased
        neurodegeneration risk.</li>
    <li>Longevity effects are not solely due to direct lifespan extension but are influenced by healthspan, cognitive
        resilience, and disease onset timing.</li>
    <li>Some studies report paradoxical protective effects of ε4 in specific contexts (e.g., improved myocardial
        performance, protection against fatty liver disease in mice), highlighting context-dependent effects.</li>
