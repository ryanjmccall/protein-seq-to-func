<h1>CCR1</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CCR1 is a chemokine receptor involved in immune cell migration and inflammation. While direct evidence linking CCR1
    sequence modifications to longevity is absent in the provided data, its role in immune regulation and
    neuroinflammation suggests potential relevance to aging-related processes. CCR1 is part of a broader network of
    chemokine receptors implicated in age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration and chronic inflammation.</p>

    <li>CCR1 is not directly described in the provided data, but related chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR5, CX3CR1) are
        included due to functional and pathway similarities.</li>
    <li>Functional effects of CCR1 are inferred from related receptors and pathways involved in neuroinflammation,
        immune aging, and age-related diseases.</li>
    <li>Longevity effects are indirect, primarily linked to disease risk (e.g., CAD, HIV, progeria) rather than direct
        lifespan modulation.</li>
