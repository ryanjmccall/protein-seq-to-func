<h1>CCR2</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CCR2 is a chemokine receptor involved in immune cell migration and inflammation. It binds to chemokines such as CCL2 (MCP-1) and plays a role in various diseases including HIV, cardiovascular disorders, and aging-related conditions. Genetic variations in CCR2 have been linked to differential disease progression, immune response, and potential longevity effects.</p>

    <td>The Ile64 allele was associated with delayed progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals (2-4 years later than Val/Val homozygotes). In a prior study, the Ile64 variant was associated with significantly lower coronary artery calcification, interpreted as beneficial. However, in the current WOSCOPS study, no significant association was found between the Ile64 allele and clinical endpoints including death from CAD, non-fatal MI, or re-vascularisation. The Ile64 allele was not associated with a significant increase or decrease in risk for these endpoints in this cohort.</td>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Val64Ile (V64I) polymorphism in CCR2 has been associated with delayed AIDS progression in HIV-infected individuals, but findings are inconsistent across studies, with no significant association found in some large cohort studies.</li>
  <li>The M249K variant in the 6th transmembrane domain is experimentally validated to impair CCR2 function and is associated with lower monocyte counts, but not with survival or infection risk.</li>
  <li>Sirolimus (rapamycin) shows strong binding to CCR2 in molecular docking studies, suggesting a potential novel mechanism for its anti-aging effects, though direct evidence in aging models is lacking.</li>
  <li>CCR2 is part of a broader chemokine network implicated in aging, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease, with multiple polymorphisms influencing disease risk and immune function.</li>
