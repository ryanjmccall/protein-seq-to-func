<h1>CCR5</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is a protein encoded by the CCR5 gene, located on chromosome 3 (3p.21.31). It functions as a co-receptor for HIV-1 entry into host cells, particularly R5-tropic strains. CCR5 is also involved in immune cell migration and inflammatory responses. A well-characterized genetic variant, CCR5Δ32, results from a 32-base pair deletion in exon 3, leading to a frameshift mutation and premature stop codon. This causes a truncated, non-functional receptor that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and not expressed on the cell surface, conferring resistance to HIV-1 infection in homozygous individuals and slower disease progression in heterozygotes.</p>

    <td>Deletion of 32 base pairs in the coding region causes a frameshift mutation, leading to premature stop codon and production of a defective receptor that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and cannot localize to the plasma membrane. This results in absence of functional CCR5 on the cell surface, preventing HIV-1 entry via CCR5 co-receptor, thereby conferring resistance to HIV-1 infection.</td>

  <li>CCR5 promoter and intronic polymorphisms are linked to various diseases including Chagas disease, cervical neoplasia, and tuberculosis, suggesting a role in immune regulation.</li>
  <li>No direct evidence of association with longevity was found in the provided data. However, the role of CCR5 in immune-inflammatory regulation may indirectly influence healthspan and longevity.</li>
  <li>Functional effects of CCR5 variants are context-dependent, influenced by genetic background, pathogen exposure, and co-infections.</li>
