    "summary": "The GANAB gene encodes the glucosidase II alpha subunit (GIIα), a critical component of the glucosidase II enzyme complex, which is involved in the processing of N-linked glycoproteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the N-glycan processing pathway, facilitating the proper folding and quality control of glycoproteins by trimming glucose residues from high-mannose N-glycans. The GIIα subunit, characterized by its β α δ barrel domain and C-terminal domain, interacts with the beta subunit encoded by the PRKCSH gene to form a functional enzyme complex. Additionally, GIIα is involved in calcium signaling through its interaction with the STIM1 protein. Mutations in GANAB are associated with genetic disorders such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and polycystic liver disease, underscoring its significance in human physiology and disease.",

This enzyme is involved in the initial trimming of high-mannose N-glycans, a crucial step in the maturation and quality control of glycoproteins. The trimming process ensures that only properly folded glycoproteins proceed through the secretory pathway, while misfolded ones are targeted for degradation. The enzyme's activity involves the removal of glucose residues from N-linked glycans, which is a necessary step for the correct folding and function of glycoproteins.",
