<h1>CCR7</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CCR7 is a chemokine receptor involved in the trafficking of immune cells, particularly T cells and dendritic cells, to secondary lymphoid organs. It plays a critical role in adaptive immunity and immune surveillance. While direct evidence linking CCR7 sequence variants to longevity is limited in the provided data, its functional role in immune resilience and aging-related immune decline (immunosenescence) suggests a potential indirect influence on healthspan and lifespan. Polymorphisms in the CCR7 gene have been associated with immune-related disease outcomes, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, which are key determinants of aging and mortality.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The provided extraction data contains no direct evidence linking CCR7 sequence variants to longevity. However, CCR7's role in immune resilience and its association with age-related diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, HIV progression) suggests indirect relevance to aging and lifespan.</li>
  <li>Functional effects of CCR7 are primarily inferred from related genes (e.g., CCL21, CCR5) and immune pathways. The table includes entries for related proteins due to data overlap in the extraction set.</li>
  <li>Confidence scores reflect the strength of evidence in the source publications. High confidence (≥0.95) indicates strong experimental or statistical support.</li>
  <li>Longevity effects are reported only when explicitly stated in the source data. Absence of a longevity effect does not imply lack of relevance to aging.</li>
