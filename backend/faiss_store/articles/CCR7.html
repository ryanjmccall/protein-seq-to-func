<h1>CCR7</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CCR7 is a chemokine receptor involved in the migration of immune cells, particularly T cells and dendritic cells, to secondary lymphoid organs. It plays a critical role in adaptive immune responses and immune surveillance. While CCR7 is not directly implicated in aging or longevity in the provided data, its function in immune system regulation may indirectly influence healthspan and longevity through maintenance of immune homeostasis.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No specific sequence intervals, modifications, or functional effects related to longevity were identified in the provided extraction.</li>
  <li>The cited reference provides general guidelines for variant interpretation but does not report direct evidence linking CCR7 to longevity.</li>
  <li>Functional studies of CCR7 are primarily focused on immune cell trafficking and inflammation, not aging-related pathways.</li>
