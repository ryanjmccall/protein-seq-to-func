<h1>APOE</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The APOE gene encodes apolipoprotein E, a protein involved in lipid metabolism and transport. It plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis and has been extensively studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Variants of APOE, particularly APOE ε4, are strongly associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and reduced longevity. Conversely, the APOE ε2 allele is linked to a protective effect and extended lifespan in some populations.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
  <li>The APOE ε2 allele is relatively rare but is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and longer survival in certain cohorts.</li>
  <li>Functional effects are mediated through altered lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-beta clearance.</li>
  <li>Longevity associations are population-dependent and influenced by environmental and genetic background factors.</li>
