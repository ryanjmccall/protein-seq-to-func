<h1>SOX2</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SOX2 is a transcription factor belonging to the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family, essential for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and for the development of the central nervous system. It plays a critical role in regulating gene expression networks involved in self-renewal and cell fate determination. While not directly implicated in aging or longevity in the provided data, its function in stem cell maintenance suggests indirect relevance to tissue regeneration and organismal lifespan.</p>
