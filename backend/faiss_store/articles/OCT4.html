<h1>OCT4</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>OCT4 (POU5F1) is a transcription factor essential for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. It plays a central role in regulating gene expression networks that sustain the undifferentiated state of stem cells. While primarily associated with early development and cellular reprogramming, its expression is typically silenced in most somatic tissues. Dysregulation of OCT4 has been linked to tumorigenesis and aberrant cellular aging, suggesting a complex relationship with longevity pathways.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Current extraction data does not provide specific sequence intervals, modifications, or associated functional or longevity effects for OCT4.</li>
  <li>The cited reference provides guidelines for variant interpretation but does not contain direct experimental data on OCT4's role in longevity.</li>
  <li>Further research is required to establish definitive sequence-function relationships linking OCT4 to aging and longevity.</li>
