<h1>CCR1</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CCR1 (C-C chemokine receptor type 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds multiple chemokines involved in immune cell migration and inflammation. While primarily studied in the context of immune responses and inflammatory diseases, emerging evidence suggests potential roles in aging and longevity through modulation of immune senescence and chronic inflammation. However, direct evidence linking specific CCR1 sequence variants to longevity remains limited.</p>
