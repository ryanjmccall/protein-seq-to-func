<h1>CCR2</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CCR2 (C-C chemokine receptor type 2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds chemokines such as CCL2, CCL7, and CCL8. It plays a critical role in immune cell migration, particularly monocytes and memory T cells, to sites of inflammation. While not directly classified as a longevity-associated protein in current literature, CCR2 has been implicated in age-related inflammatory processes and metabolic dysfunction, which are key contributors to aging and lifespan regulation. Genetic variation in CCR2 may influence inflammatory tone and immune surveillance, potentially affecting healthspan and longevity.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No specific sequence variants in CCR2 with documented functional or longevity effects were identified in the provided extraction data.</li>
  <li>The cited reference provides general guidelines for interpreting sequence variants but does not report specific findings on CCR2 and longevity.</li>
  <li>Further research is needed to determine whether CCR2 polymorphisms or expression levels correlate with aging phenotypes or lifespan in humans or model organisms.</li>
