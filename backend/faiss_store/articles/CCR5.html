<h1>CCR5</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CCR5 (C-C chemokine receptor type 5) is a protein encoded by the CCR5 gene in humans. It functions as a receptor for chemokines, particularly CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, and plays a key role in immune cell trafficking and inflammatory responses. CCR5 is also a co-receptor for HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T cells. A naturally occurring 32-base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene (CCR5-Δ32) results in a truncated, non-functional protein and has been associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection. While not directly linked to human longevity in the provided data, the functional impact of CCR5 variants may influence immune aging and disease susceptibility, potentially affecting lifespan indirectly.</p>
