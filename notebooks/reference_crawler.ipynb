    "# Sequence to function\n",

    "## The problem\n",
    "The problem we are working on is called sequence to function. Ideally this means we have a sequence and we infer some kind of function\n",
    "\n",
    "### The sequence: \n",
    "To me this means a few different things. \n",
    "- Gene sequence mutations\n",
    "- Gene and Protein Orthologs\n",
    "- Post-translational modification\n",
    "\n",
    "### The function: \n",
    "This also could mean a few things. My mind initially went to physiology, but now realized function could be alot broader. For example simple ligand enzyme binding could be related to funciton. The pathway that the protein is involved in, the regulation\n",
    "- A change in ligand binding interactions (Initial GPCR activation)\n",
    "- A change in metabolitic secondary activity (GPCRs downstream)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The solution\n",
    "When thinking about a solution to the hackathon problem. Ryan has suggested, could we start with building a full profile with only two data categories (for the sequence). To me this means: \n",
    "- Gene name, mutation/ortholog\n",
    "- Protein name, post-translational modification\n",
    "\n",
    "Given those could we pull out somekind of knowledge graph that will allow us to relate it to currently known research. This is where we will need the __agent__"

Several lines of evidence suggest that this disease is caused by a defect in the growth hormone receptor. In order to analyze the receptor gene in patients with Laron-type dwarfism and with other growth disorders, we have first determined the gene structure in normal individuals. There are nine exons that encode the receptor and several additional exons in the 5' untranslated region. The coding exons span at least 87 kilobase pairs of chromosome 5. Characterization of the growth hormone receptor gene from nine patients with Laron-type dwarfism shows that two individuals have a deletion of a large portion of the extracellular, hormone binding domain of the receptor gene. Interestingly, this deletion includes nonconsecutive exons, suggesting that an unusual rearrangement may have occurred. Thus, we provide direct evidence that Laron-type dwarfism can result from a defect in the structural gene for the growth hormone receptor.\"}\n",

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed COS-7 cells transiently expressing the full-length human (h) GHR and observed specific GH-binding activity in the cell supernatants. Concomitantly, an alternatively spliced form in the cytoplasmic domain of GHR, hGHR-tr, was isolated from several human tissues. hGHR-tr is identical in sequence to hGHR, except for a 26-bp deletion leading to a stop codon at position 280, thereby truncating 97.5% of the intracellular domain of the receptor protein. When compared with hGHR, hGHR-tr showed a significantly increased capacity to generate a soluble GHBP. Interestingly, this alternative transcript is also expressed in liver from rabbits, mice, and rats, suggesting that, in these four species, proteolysis of the corresponding truncated transmembrane GHR is a common mechanism leading to GHBP generation. These findings support the hypothesis that GHBP may at least partly result from alternative splicing of the region encoding the intracellular domain and that the absence of a cytoplasmic domain may be involved in increased release of GHBP.'}\n",

Its messenger RNA is expressed in several human tissues and predicts a severely truncated GHR protein that lacks 97.5% of the intracellular domain. Because these two hGHR isoforms, which display similar binding affinity, are coexpressed in several tissues, they may reside side by side and, therefore, interrelate. To further characterize the biological properties of hGHRtr in comparison with hGHR, we generated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing each of these hGHR isoforms. Cross-linking of [125I]hGH to CHO/hGHRtr cells revealed a majored specific complex with apparent Mr of approximately 100 kDa, which would indicate the hGHRtr to be in molecular mass form of about 80 kDa. When compared with CHO/hGHR, CHO/hGHRtr cells secreted higher amounts of soluble GH-binding protein (GHBP). In contrast to CHO/hGHR cells, CHO/hGHRtr cells did not exhibit any GH-induced receptor down-regulation, and internalization was markedly reduced. Analysis of the constitutive turnover of cellular hGHR and soluble GHBP showed that incubation of CHO/hGHR cells with cycloheximide caused parallel disappearance of hGHR and GHBP. This contrasted with the stability of GHRtr, which showed no decline after cycloheximide treatment for up to 4 h, suggesting that the bulk GHRtr and GHBP may be derived from preformed proteins. Thus, in contrast to hGHR, hGHRtr is fixed at the cell membrane; it undergoes minimal internalization, no down-regulation by hGH, no constitutive turnover for as long as 4 h, but increased capacity to generate a soluble GHBP. Because hGHRtr failed to undergo ligand-induced internalization, the source of the continuous, undisturbed GHBP released into the medium may be from an intracellular storage pool. The relative abundance of these two hGHR isoforms, through regulation of splicing, could be of critical importance in modulating the biological effects of GH.'}\n",

A key mechanism of treatment resistance in patients who progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the generation of alternatively spliced AR variants (AR-V). Unlike full-length AR isoforms, AR-Vs are constitutively active and refractory to current receptor-targeting agents and hence drive tumor progression. Identifying regulators of AR-V synthesis may therefore provide new therapeutic opportunities in combination with conventional AR-targeting agents. Our understanding of AR transcript splicing, and the factors that control the synthesis of AR-Vs, remains limited. Although candidate-based approaches have identified a small number of AR-V splicing regulators, an unbiased analysis of splicing factors important for AR-V generation is required to fill an important knowledge gap and furnish the field with novel and tractable targets for prostate cancer treatment. To that end, we conducted a bespoke CRISPR screen to profile splicing factor requirements for AR-V synthesis. MFAP1 and CWC22 were shown to be required for the generation of AR-V mRNA transcripts, and their depletion resulted in reduced AR-V protein abundance and cell proliferation in several CRPC models. Global transcriptomic analysis of MFAP1-depleted cells revealed both AR-dependent and -independent transcriptional impacts, including genes associated with DNA damage response. As such, MFAP1 downregulation sensitized prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation, suggesting that therapeutically targeting AR-V splicing could provide novel cellular vulnerabilities which can be exploited in CRPC.

To decipher the molecular basis of this unusual trait, we isolated a 6.8-kilobase fragment spanning exon 3 from individuals expressing GHRfl. Sequence analysis revealed the existence of two 99% identical retroelements flanking this exon. Unexpectedly, individuals expressing GHRd3 displayed a 2.7-kilobase deletion involving exon 3, which most likely results from an ancestral homologous recombination between the two retroelements. The lineage of these retroelements during primate evolution revealed the species specificity of the GHRd3 allele. These findings led us to propose a model underlying the existence of the sole GHRfl allele in most species. Such a retrovirus-mediated alternative splice mimicry, which clears up several as yet unexplained phenomena (i.e. the above-mentioned expression data, the Mendelian inheritance of GHR expression patterns, and the deletion of nonconsecutive exons in growth hormone resistant patients), represents a novel physiological mechanism accounting for protein diversity between and within species.'}\n",

In this study, using the mutational approach to the extracellular domain of the human GHR, we demonstrated that deletion of three residues located close to the transmembrane domain abolishes constitutive GHBP shedding without change in cellular GH binding.

A heightened response to GH was also measured by examining GH-responsive genes expressed in the liver after exogenous GH administration. To further understand the link between SOCS2 and the GH-signaling cascade, we investigated the nature of these interactions using structure/function and biochemical interaction studies.

GH actions are mediated by the Growth Hormone Receptor; a member of the cytokine receptor super family that signals chiefly through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Target tissue responsiveness to GH is under regulatory control to avoid excessive and off-target effects upon GHR activation. The suppressor of cytokine signalling 2 (SOCS) is a key regulator of GHR sensitivity. This is clearly shown in mice where the SOCS2 gene has been inactivated, which show 30-40% increase in body length, a phenotype that is dependent on endogenous GH secretion. SOCS2 is a GH-stimulated, STAT5b-regulated gene that acts in a negative feedback loop to downregulate GHR signalling. Since the biochemical basis for these actions is poorly understood, we studied the molecular function of SOCS2. We demonstrated that SOCS2 is part of a multimeric complex with intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutational analysis shows that the interaction with Elongin B/C controls SOCS2 protein turnover and affects its molecular activity. Increased GHR levels were observed in livers from SOCS2⁻/⁻ mice and in the absence of SOCS2 in in vitro experiments. We showed that SOCS2 regulates cellular GHR levels through direct ubiquitination and in a proteasomally dependent manner.

SOCS2 binds to phosphotyrosine-modified epitopes as degrons for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, yet the molecular basis of substrate recognition has remained elusive. Here, we report co-crystal structures of SOCS2-ElonginB-ElonginC in complex with phosphorylated peptides from substrates growth hormone receptor (GHR-pY595) and erythropoietin receptor (EpoR-pY426) at 1.98 Å and 2.69 Å, respectively. Both peptides bind in an extended conformation recapitulating the canonical SH2 domain-pY pose, but capture different conformations of the EF loop via specific hydrophobic interactions. The flexible BG loop is fully defined in the electron density, and does not contact the substrate degron directly. Cancer-associated SNPs located around the pY pocket weaken substrate-binding affinity in biophysical assays. Our findings reveal insights into substrate recognition and specificity by SOCS2, and provide a blueprint for small molecule ligand design.'}\n",

Direct analysis of exon 10 of the GH receptor gene showed that both nucleotide substitutions reside on the same chromosome and were inherited from the patient's mother. Evaluation of DNA from 10 additional prospectively recruited children with growth failure and a clinical picture similar to the index case did not reveal any nucleotide alterations in codons 422, 560, or 561.

All constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Both wild type and mutant full-length rabbit GH and PRL receptors, as well as GH and prolactin BPs (wild type and mutant), were detected by Western blot in cell membranes and concentrated culture media, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies showed that wild type and mutant full-length GH receptors had the same cell surface and intracellular distribution and were expressed with comparable intensities. In contrast, all mutant forms (full-length receptors or BPs), completely lost their modify the synthesis ligand. These results clearly demonstrate that this point mutation (patients with Laron syndrome) does not modify the synthesis or the intracellular pathway of receptor proteins, but rather abolishes ability of the receptor or BP to bind GH and is thus responsible for the extreme GH resistance in these patients.'}\n",

To test this hypothesis directly, we investigated patients displaying the classic features of Laron syndrome (familial GH resistance characterized by severe dwarfism and metabolic dysfunction), except for the presence of normal binding activity of the plasma GH-binding protein, a molecule that derives from the exoplasmic-coding domain of the GHR gene. In two unrelated families, the same GHR mutation was identified, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved aspartate residue by histidine at position 152 (D152H) of the exoplasmic domain, within the postulated interface sequence involved in homodimerization. The recombinant mutated receptor protein was correctly expressed at the plasma membrane. It displayed subnormal GH-binding activity, a finding in agreement with the X-ray crystal structure data inferring this aspartate residue outside the GH-binding domain. However, mAb-based studies suggested the critical role of aspartate 152 in the proper folding of the interface area. We show that a recombinant soluble form of the mutant receptor is unable to dimerize, the D152H substitution also preventing the formation of heterodimers of wild-type and mutant molecules. These results provide in vivo evidence that monomeric receptors are inactive and that receptor dimerization is involved in the primary signalling of the GH-associated growth-promoting and metabolic actions.'}\n",

At present, the expertise to achieve this for a specific disease is often exclusive to one unit with a research interest. It will be important to establish a coordinated approach at a supraregional level to provide molecular diagnosis for rare disorders as a fast reliable clinical service. In addition understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease is likely to direct a search for new treatments. For instance, calcium channel blockers have been used in nesidoblastosis to reduce the hypersecretion of insulin, as a result of the recognition of the role that calcium has in the function of the beta-cell ATP sensitive K+ channel. Although the potential benefits of hGH are now being clearly defined in a range of growth disorders, the treatment is invasive and expensive. It is likely that future endocrine therapeutic developments could include slow release growth hormone preparations, orally active growth hormone mimetics, or even hormone production from an ectopic viral cDNA vector. The next \"advances in endocrinology\" will also reveal whether leptin will have a therapeutic role in appetite control or even the modulation of pubertal development.'}\n",

Her height SD score increased from -6.3 to -4.7 without acceleration of bone age. Isolated breast development progressed despite pubertal suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue, which was stopped after 3 yr because of growth deceleration. Facial coarsening was documented with serial photographs. Sequencing and in vitro analysis identified a homozygous base pair substitution in exon 6 of the proband's GH receptor (GHR), which changed amino acid 131 from proline to glutamine (P131Q) and disrupted GH binding. Both the P131Q-mutated human GHR and wildtype (wt) hGHR were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, as demonstrated by Western blotting, but the P131Q-transfected cells did not bind 125I-hGH. Similarly, FDC-P1 cells transfected with wthGHR bound 125I-hGH with high affinity and proliferated in response to GH, whereas the P131Q hGHR cells did neither. In CHO-K1 cells cotransfected with wthGHR and the Egr-1 promotor linked to a luciferase reporter gene, GH evoked a 2.14 +/- 0.21-fold increase in luciferase activity, but there was no response in the cells carrying the P131Q hGHR mutation. From examination of the crystal structure of the GHR, we suggest that the P131Q mutation disrupts the interdomain link between the extracellular domains of the GHR, causing a conformational change that results in disruption of the GH binding site.\"}\n",

The D152H mutation was previously reported. We have reproduced the three novel mutations in the GHR complementary DNA and analyzed their consequences in human 293 transfected cells. In cells expressing the I153T and V155G mutants, binding of [125I]human GH at the cell surface was very low, whereas binding to total membrane fractions was much less affected, suggesting impaired cell surface expression. Binding assays with cells expressing the Q154P mutant revealed severe defects both at the cell surface and in total particulate membrane fractions. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that cell surface expression of the three mutants was altered, and colocalization studies suggested that most of the mutant receptors are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Endoglycosidase H resistance tests also indicated that the majority of I153T and V155G GHRs are trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, mutations on contiguous amino acids of the GHR result in various defects. The I153T, Q154P, and V155G mutations mainly affect intracellular trafficking and binding affinity of the receptor, whereas the D152H mutation affects receptor expression, dimerization, and signaling.'}\n"
