Biased signaling of G protein-coupled receptors describes an ability of different ligands that preferentially activate an alternative downstream signaling pathway. In this work, we identified and characterized different N-terminal truncations of endogenous chemokine CCL15 as balanced or biased agonists targeting CCR1, and presented three cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of the CCR1\u2013G i complex in the ligand-free form or bound to different CCL15 truncations with a resolution of 2.6\u20132.9 \u00c5, illustrating the structural basis of natural biased signaling that initiates an inflammation response. Complemented with pharmacological and computational studies, these structures revealed it was the conformational change of Tyr291 (Y291 7.43 ) in CCR1 that triggered its polar network rearrangement in the orthosteric binding pocket and allosterically regulated the activation of \u03b2-arrestin signaling. Our structure of CCL15-bound CCR1 also exhibited a critical site for ligand binding distinct from many other chemokine\u2013receptor complexes, providing new insights into the mode of chemokine recognition. Cryo-EM structures of the CCR1\u2013G i complex with N-terminal truncations of the endogenous chemokine CCL15 revealed that the conformational change of Tyr291 in CCR1 regulates \u03b2-arrestin signaling.

In most cases, the activation of G proteins and \u03b2-arrestin corresponds to their own respective downstream effectors, thus performing distinct biological functions 3 . Specific ligands at some GPCRs, such as the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT 1 R), the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), the \u03bc-opioid receptor (\u03bcOR) and the kappa opioid receptor (\u03baOR), have been demonstrated to preferentially stimulate the G protein or \u03b2\u2010arrestin signaling pathways 4 \u2013 7 . This phenomenon is termed \u2018biased signaling\u2019, provides new insights into GPCR biology and has a broad prospect of clinical applications, since selective activation or inhibition of specific signaling cascades has been proved to increase the therapeutic use of drugs targeting GPCRs with minimal side effects. Nevertheless, understanding of molecular mechanism underlining biased signaling has so far remained a challenging task 3 . Chemokine\u2013receptor interactions play an essential role in guiding leukocyte trafficking in immune surveillance and inflammation response 8 , 9 . According to the number and position of conserved cysteine residues in their N-terminal regions, chemokines are classified as cysteine, cysteine cysteine, cysteine X cysteine (CXC) and cysteine X3 cysteines (CX3C) subsets 10 \u2013 12 . So far, at least 50 endogenous chemokines and 20 chemokine receptors have been identified in humans. The interactions between chemokines and their receptors exhibit considerable promiscuity, wherein most receptors can be recognized by multiple chemokines and most chemokines can activate multiple receptors. These chemokine\u2013receptor interactions were previously regarded as redundant, but it is now appreciated that many chemokine interactions display biased agonism, enabling the fine-tuning of a chemokine-induced physiological response 3 , 13 . Among the chemokine receptor family, the chemokine receptor CCR1 unusually exhibits the most ligand promiscuity, which can recognize at least nine human cysteine cysteine chemokines, including CCL3, CCL5-9 (CCL6 and CCL9 are murine), CCL13\u201316 and CCL23 (refs. 9 , 11 , 14 ). CCR1 is widely expressed in various immune cells, and the knockdown of CCR1 has proved effective in suppressing the maturation and migration of immune cells, thus being regarded as an attractive drug target for the treatment of many autoimmune and allergic diseases, such as asthma 15 \u2013 18 . Structure-based sequence alignment of CCR1 agonists shows high divergences at the N terminus, with the core region exhibiting conserved similarity, indicating that the N terminus of chemokines contributes to different signal transduction properties of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a ). CCL15 is an endogenous ligand of CCR1 at which the N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved up on its secretion to extracellular media. Identified by mass spectrometry of clinical samples, the N terminus of secreted CCL15 underwent further cleavage and exhibited different N-terminal truncations due to proteolytic processing mediated by activated mast cells and neutrophils 19 , 20 . For instance, CCL15 (22\u201392) was generated after digestion by either chymase or cathepsin G, while CCL15 (29\u201392) was produced by elastase treatment of CCL15 (ref. 19 ). More and more studies have suggested that the N terminus of chemokines worked as a determinant for CCR1 activation, as well as giving rise to biased agonism 21 , 22 . In this study, we found that compared to the longer form of CCL15 N-terminal truncation (CCL15 (26\u201392), termed CCL15 L ), the shorter forms of CCL15 N-terminal truncations (CCL15 (27\u201392), termed CCL15 M , and CCL15 from (28\u201392) to (31\u201392), termed CCL15 S ) displayed poor efficacy in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, thus performing stronger bias toward G protein pathways. To develop an understanding of the structural features that contributes to the biased signaling of CCR1, we determined three cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human CCR1\u2013G i complexes either in the absence of ligand (apo) or in bound to CCL15 L or CCL15 M . Together with mutagenesis and functional studies, our results provide a new molecular mechanism to explain biased signaling of CCR1 and reveal the diverse binding modes of chemokine receptors that contribute to ligand-selective recognition. Results Biased signaling of CCR1 induced by CCL15 To study the mechanism for CCL15-mediated activation of CCR1, we purified CCL15 (22\u201392) from insect cells, which was reported as the longest N-terminal digestion product 19 . Identified by mass spectrometry, we found that the first determined residue of the CCL15 N terminus in the G i -coupled complex was F26, and the main forms of CCL15 truncations involved in complex formation were CCL15 (26\u201392), CCL15 (27\u201392), CCL15 (29\u201392) and CCL15 (30\u201392) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b ). This phenomenon is consistent with the fact that physiological fluids, proinflammatory proteases or human cell supernatants can truncate the N termini of the cognate chemokines of CCR1, such as CCL6, CCL9, CCL15 and CCL23, thereby enabling the cleaved ligands to activate the receptor 19 , 20 .

N = 8 independent experiments, performed with single replicates. In d , e , all data are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Source data Therefore, we separately purified N-terminal truncations of CCL15 from (26\u201392) to (31\u201392) and measured their effects on both G proteins and \u03b2-arrestin pathways. All N-terminal truncations of CCL15 exhibited almost the same or with only slightly reduced potency on G protein activation, but removal of the first two N-terminal amino acids, CCL15 truncations from (28\u201392) to (31\u201392), generated a strong decline in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2c ). These results were in good agreement with the endocytosis of CCR1 in human monocytic THP-1 cells treated with corresponding N-terminal truncations, which was proposed to be mediated by \u03b2-arrestin pathway (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2d ) 1 . Thus, compared with CCL15 (26\u201392) and CCL15 (27\u201392), all the shorter variants, from CCL15 (28\u201392) to CCL15 (31\u201392), exhibited strong bias toward G i -protein pathway (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1 ). These results were consistent with previous reports on CCR1 that CCL15 (29\u201392) was biased toward both G\u03b1 i activation and cAMP inhibition relative to CCL15 (27\u201392) 22 . Based on the above results, we anticipated that the N terminus of CCL15 was critical for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment when these truncations displayed low nanomolar potency albeit with reduced efficacy. Therefore, we grouped these N-terminal truncations of CCL15 into three categories: (1) CCL15 (26\u201392), which was a long form CCL15 (CCL15 L ) and showed a bias toward \u03b2-arrestin pathway; (2) CCL15 (27\u201392), which was a medium form CCL15 (CCL15 M ) and displayed balanced activation between G protein and \u03b2-arrestin pathways and (3) CCL15 truncations from (28\u201392) to (31\u201392), which were short forms of CCL15 (CCL15 S ) and were the strong G protein-biased agonists of CCR1. These findings revealed that the N-terminal region of CCL15 was not essential for CCR1-mediated G protein signaling, but critical for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, suggesting the natural biased agonism of chemokine receptors under physiological conditions. Cryo-EM structures of three CCR1\u2013G i complexes To investigate the molecular basis of signaling bias of CCR1, we aimed to obtain the structures of active CCR1 bound to CCL15 variants of different N-terminal truncations that displayed different bias profiles. The wild-type full-length human CCR1 and different ligands were coexpressed in insect cells for complex formation. A NanoBiT tethering strategy was used for complex stabilization (Extended Data Fig. 3 ) 23 , 24 . By using cryo-EM analyses, three structures of CCR1-G i complexes in CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound and apo states were determined at overall resolutions of 2.6, 2.7 and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively. Most side chains in the ligand and the seven transmembrane (7TM) domain of CCR1 in all three complexes could be clearly defined and enabled us to build and refine the near-atomic resolution structures of these complexes (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5 ). Fig. 2 Cryo-EM structures of CCR1\u2013G i complexes in the CCL15 L -, CCL15 M - bound and apo states. a , c , e , Cryo-EM density maps of CCR1-G i complexes bound to CCL15 L ( a ), CCL15 M ( c ) and in the apo state ( e ). b , d , f , Models of CCR1\u2013G i complexes in three states (left).

Atomic models and EM density shown as sticks and surfaces, respectively. EM density of CCL15 L and CCL15 M shown as a mesh. Globally, all these CCR1 structures were similar to each other in their backbone conformations (Extended Data Fig. 6 ), suggesting a common conformation for G protein activation of CCR1 among these structures. In addition, the structure of the apo CCR1\u2013G i complex resembles the CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound CCR1\u2013G i complexes, except that for the bottom of the ligand-binding pockets in apo CCR1 was empty. The formation of the CCR1\u2013G i complex in the absence of the ligand was consistent with CCR1, which exhibited higher basal activity of G i signaling compared to other chemokine receptors such as CCR2, CCR5 and CCR10 (ref. 25 ). Recognition of CCR1 by CCL15 The recognition of a ligand by chemokine receptors is a complex process that is still not fully understood 26 \u2013 28 . Since the structural alignment of CCL15 L - and CCL15 M -CCR1 complexes revealed almost the same binding mode between the ligand and receptor, we used the structure of CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 complex as a model for clarity of presentation to explore the mode of CCL15 binding to CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). So far, only a few high-resolution structures of chemokine receptors in complex with chemokines have been resolved 29 \u2013 33 . As shown in Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013d , the orientation of the globular core of CCL15 L to CCR1 was similar to that of CCL5 5P7 bound to CCR5 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 5UIW ), but rotated by about 50\u00b0 when compared to the corresponding chemokines in the CCL20\u2013CCR6 (PDB ID 6WWZ ) and CXCL8\u2013CXCR2 (PDB ID 6LFL ) complexes, suggesting that diverse recognition modes exist among these chemokine\u2013receptor interactions 29 \u2013 31 . According to the classic \u2018two-site\u2019 model, the binding of chemokines to receptors involves two main interaction sites: (1) the chemokine recognition site 1 (CRS1), where the N terminus of the receptor interacts with the globular core of the chemokine and (2) the chemokine recognition site 2 (CRS2), where the N terminus of the chemokine interacts with the transmembrane binding pocket of the receptor 32 , 34 . The CCL15 L -bound CCR1 structure shows that the CCL15 L is stably anchored in the extracellular half of the receptor 7TM domain and inserts deeply into the helical bundle (Fig. 3a ). At the CRS1, the N terminus of CCR1 (residue D 17 YGDATPCQK 26 ) ran parallel with the N-loop region of CCL15 L and fitted onto the groove formed by the N-loop and \u03b23 strands of CCL15 L , corresponding to a surface buried area of 745 \u00c5 2 (740.4 \u00c5 2 in CCL15 M \u2013CCR1) (Fig. 3a\u2013c and Supplementary Table 3 ). Although the electron microscopy (EM) maps of both CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 and CCL15 M \u2013CCR1 only revealed the resolved density starting from the residue D17 NT in the N terminus of CCR1, the various N-terminal truncations of the first 20 residues of CCR1 retained partial activities of CCL15-induced G protein activation as determined by NanoBiT assay. Furthermore, the deletion of the first 25 residues of CCR1 almost eliminated CCL15-induced receptor activity, suggesting that the CCR1 N terminus plays a critical role in ligand recognition and receptor activation (Fig. 3d ). At the CRS2, the N terminus of CCL15 L inserted into the pocket within the 7TM domain in a position that was notably deeper than other chemokines bound to the corresponding chemokine receptors (Extended Data Fig. 7e ). As shown in Fig. 3e , the most N-terminal residue of CCL15 L , F26, faced toward the minor pocket formed by L87 2.57 , W90 2.60 , Y113 3.32 and Y291 7.43 . The backbone amide of H27 formed a hydrogen bond with E287 7.39 (superscripts indicate the Ballesteros\u2013Weinstein numbering scheme) 35 , consistent with the fact that the critical role of residue E287 7.39 , which is found in 74% of chemokine receptors and is crucial for chemokine-induced activity in many chemokine receptors 36 , 37 . Meanwhile, mutations of these F26-binding residues were previously reported to decrease the inhibitory effect of CCR1-targed small-molecule antagonists, suggesting that they were also important for activity of the antagonists 38 , 39 . It was also noteworthy that there were two side chain to side chain hydrogen bonds formed between H27 and D280 7.32 , D31 and Q25 NT , respectively (Fig. 3e ).

Hydrogen bonds are depicted as dashed lines. Source data Besides the two classical chemokine recognition sites as discussed above, CCL5 5P7 was previously reported interacting with CCR5 through an epitope designated as the CRS1.5, where the 19 PC 20 motif of CCR5 packed against the conserved disulfide of its ligand 29 . CRS1.5 was also observed in the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 complex, with hydrogen bonds forming between C24 NT and CCL15 (Extended Data Fig. 7g ). In agreement with that, C24 NT A substitution significantly impaired the activation of the receptor (Extended Data Fig. 7h ). Furthermore, additional interactions were observed between CCL15 L and CCR1, where \u03b21-\u03b22 strands and the 30s loop (residue 50 FETSSECS 57 ) of CCL15 L were found to interact with ECLs 2\u20133, and with TMs 5\u20136 of CCR1 (Fig. 3f\u2013h ). This recognition site was also observed in the CCL5 [5P7] \u2013CCR5 complex, which was designated as the CRS3 hereafter. The buried surface areas of the CRS3 of CCR1 (700 \u00c5 2 in CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 and 748.2 \u00c5 2 in CCL15 M \u2013CCR1, respectively) were comparable to the corresponding area in the CCL5 5P7 \u2013CCR5 complex (698.5 \u00c5 2 ), far more significant than that in other chemokine receptor structures including the CXCL8\u2013CXCR2 (300 \u00c5 2 ) and CCL20-CCR6 (448 \u00c5 2 ) complexes (Supplementary Table 3 ). The CCL15 L \u03b21 strand ran antiparallel with ECL2 of CCR1 where these two parts interacted with each other primarily through hydrophobic effects. Meanwhile, the 30s loop of CCL15 L submerged into the 7TM pocket of CCR1, where it made contact with ECL2 and ECL3, and with TM5 and TM6 through comprehensive hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3g,h ). Sequence alignment showed that the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 strands and the 30s loop were relatively more conserved than the N-loop among the endogenous ligands of CCR1, indicating the CRS3 might be a major determinant for ligand binding of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a ). Y 7.43 acted as a \u2018toggle switch\u2019 for biased signaling It is widely accepted that interactions between biased agonists and GPCRs result in the stabilization of a unique conformation adopted by the receptor that preferentially activates one downstream signaling 2 . Structural comparison of the extracellular pocket core of CCR1 among CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound and apo states was performed for the study of biased signaling. In the extracellular pocket core of apo CCR1, the side chain of Y291 7.43 pointed toward TM2, forming hydrogen bonds with T86 2.56 and W90 2.60 (Fig. 4a ). On the binding of the CCL15 L into the 7TM pocket of CCR1, the aromatic group of CCL15 F26 formed strong interactions with W90 2.60 and Y291 7.43 . Hence, the resulting steric hindrance pushed the side chain of W90 2.60 and Y291 7.43 to sway from their original positions by 46\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, respectively, thereby breaking the Y291 7.43 \u2013W90 2.60 \u2013T86 2.56 polar network (Extended Data Fig. 8a ). Consequently, the released Y291 7.43 then formed hydrogen bonds with Y113 3.32 and Y255 6.51 , establishing CCR1 in a conformation favorable for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment without strongly influencing G protein signaling (Figs. 1e and 4b ). The density of Y 7.43 in the CCL15 M \u2013CCR1 complex displayed two alternative conformations, with one conformation resembling the CCL15 L -bound state and the other resembling the apo CCR1 state (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8b ). These findings illustrated that the CCL15 M -induced conformation of Y 7.43 was flexible and therefore retained partial capability of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, which accounted reasonably well for the functional results (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2c ).

Bias factors derived from curve fit parameters from d . N = four independent experiments, performed with quadruple replicates. P values were calculated using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t -test. The asterisk symbols indicate statistically significant difference ( P = 0.042 and 0.0003, from top to bottom, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001). In d \u2013 h , all data are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Source data Consistently, the variance of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment among all CCL15 N-terminal truncations was significantly decreased with alanine substitution of Y291 7.43 in CCR1. By contrast, the effect of Y291 7.43 A mutation on G protein activation was relatively smaller, resulting in a strong decline in signaling bias of most CCL15 S truncations compared to CCL15 M (Fig. 4d,e , Extended Data Fig. 8c and Supplementary Table 5 ). As shown in Extended Data Fig. 8d,e , a Y291 7.43 A mutation significantly enhanced the CCL15 S -induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment pathway of CCR1, but hardly influenced either the CCL15 S -induced G protein activation or any downstream signaling induced by CCL15 L . A phenylalanine mutation of Y291 7.43 in CCR1 was observed to be not strong enough to destroy the biased signaling induced by CCL15 S (Extended Data Fig. 8f ). Taken together, these results indicate that it was the hydrophobic interaction between F26 and Y291 7.43 that triggered the conformational change of Y291 7.43 , playing a critical role in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. The side chain of Y291 7.43 seemed to be unfavorable for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment in the presence of CCL15 S . Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations of CCR1 with the protein removed showed that three distinctive structural configurations in the orthosteric pocket induced different conformational dynamics at the cytoplasmic half of the receptor, especially at the TM1, TM7 and H8 regions. These results indicate the differential conformational dynamics in response to the extracellular polar network exchange, which might contribute to the natural biased agonism of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, mutations of the complementary residues in the polar networks including the T86 2.56 A/W90 2.60 A and the Y113 3.32 F/Y255 6.51 F mutations, were also observed to reduce the difference of signal bias between CCL15 S and CCL15 L , suggesting that the residues within this region were important for signal transduction of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 10a\u2013e ). It should be mentioned that the mutation of Y113 3.32 A/Y255 6.51 A lead to an almost complete loss of CCR1 expression localized on plasma membrane, suggesting that the residues of Y113 3.32 and Y255 6.51 participated in maintaining the three-dimensional (3D) structure of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 10f ). The T86 2.56 A/W90 2.60 A mutant displayed an increased signaling bias toward \u03b2-arrestin pathway, while the Y113 3.32 F/Y255 6.51 F mutation increased the bias toward G protein signaling (Fig. 4f-h and Supplementary Table 6 ). Taken together, these results demonstrated that distinct rotamers of Y291 7.43 in CCR1 served as a sensor to discriminate different forms of CCL15 truncations, and mutations that disturbed the equilibrium balance of the intracellular polar network of Y291 7.43 triggered biased signaling of CCR1. Discussion Innate immune cells express multiple chemokine receptors and chemokines to control their migration, activation, differentiation and survival. At a cellular level, chemokines can synergize or antagonize with each other for downstream signal transduction. For instance, chemokine receptors not only could be stimulated by chemokines for G protein recruitments, but also undergo internalization on some chemokine agonist binding, leading to impairment of other chemokines\u2019 efficacies. Therefore, molecular mechanisms of chemokine regulation and signaling bias of chemokine receptors are required for understanding of their functional intricacies. In this paper, we identified and characterized the biased signaling properties of different CCL15 variants and their binding to CCR1. While the longer form of CCL15 (CCL15 L ) displayed \u03b2-arrestin-biased signaling, the shorter forms of CCL15 (CCL15 S ) showed gradual biased agonism toward G i -mediated signaling (Fig. 1 ). The cryo-EM structures we reported here complemented the molecular mechanisms of immunomodulation induced by these endogenous chemokines. Structural alignments revealed that CCL15 resembled an orientation similar to CCL5 [5P7] \u2013CCR5 (PDB ID 5UIW ), but rotated by about 50\u00b0 when compared to other chemokine\u2013receptor complexes. This phenomenon suggested that at least two distinct binding modes existed in the chemokine recognition system (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013d ). In addition, both the CCL15\u2013CCR1 and CCL5 [5P7] \u2013CCR5 complexes showed a new recognition site (the CRS3), where the 30s loop of the ligand was submerged into the 7TM pocket of its receptor, demonstrating it is a major determinant for ligand binding of CCR1 and CCR3. Structural comparisons and functional experiments confirmed that conformational rearrangement of Y 7.43 and exchange of polar networks in the orthosteric binding pocket of CCR1 lead to strongly biased signaling. In particular, the longer form of CCL15 (CCL15 L ), which has a significant interaction with Y 7.43 , displayed strong activation of both G i protein and \u03b2-arrestin pathways. The shorter forms of CCL15 forms (CCL15 S ) have impaired ability to activate the \u03b2-arrestin pathway but not G i -mediated signaling, making them endogenous biased agonists prone to stimulating the G protein pathway. Y 7.43 is conserved over 90 class A GPCRs, and 65 class A GPCRs have at least one polar residue at both polar network sides, including the \u03bcOR, \u03baOR and AT 1 R (Supplementary Table 7 ). In two recent studies on the AT 1 R, Y 7.43 was also found to be important for the allosteric regulation of receptor conformations in response to ligands with different bias profiles 4 , 40 . Unlike our observation in CCR1, Y 7.43 in AT 1 R was proposed to be critical for ligand-dependent coupling of Gq signaling rather than \u03b2-arrestin coupling. Although the ultimate response to the movement of Y 7.43 in CCR1 and AT 1 R was different, Y 7.43 in both receptors was involved in determining the conformation of the intracellular half of TM7, and played a critical role in modulating downstream signaling. The side chain of Y 7.43 in both CCL15 M \u2013CCR1 and AngII-AT 1 R complexes displayed highly dynamic changes, which seemed to be typical for more balanced ligands. Together, our results provide structural insights into chemokine recognition, biased signaling and pharmacology of CCR1. Although CCR1 has been regarded as a candidate target for autoimmune and allergic diseases for a long time, the success of CCR1-targeted drug development has been limited. Manipulating the conformational exchange of the polar networks in the receptor orthosteric binding pocket to achieve bias signaling could be a general framework for the GPCRs with the conserved Y 7.43 , allowing rational design of biased ligands with an ultimate aim to achieve function-selective therapeutics with fewer side effects. Methods Expression and purification of CCL15 N-terminal truncations The full-length of human CCL15 (1\u201392) complementary DNA was bought from Miaolingbio. The sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) was cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector, containing a GP67 signal peptide at the N terminus before the ligand to facilitate protein secretion. A maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag followed by a C-terminal 8*His tag was fused into the C terminal of CCL15 (26\u201392) with a linker containing a 3C protease cleavage site (LEVLFQGP). Using the bac-to-bac system, CCL15 (26\u201392)-3C-MBP-8*His was overexpressed by High Five insect cells. Insect cell cultures were grown in protein-free insect cell culture medium (Expression Systems ESF 921). After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and the initial purification was performed using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare). CCL15 (26\u201392)-3C-MBP-8*His was eluted with high imidazole elution buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole). Then, the removal of C-terminal MBP and 8*His tag were achieved by 3C protease digestion (1:100). Next, 10% (w/v) glycerol was added together with 3C protease. Finally, purification to homogeneity of CCL15 (26\u201392) was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on a SuperdexTM 75 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in size exclusion chromatography buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol), with the separation of CCL15 (26\u201392), 3C protease and MPB. About 1 mg of target proteins could be obtained from 1 l of culture medium. The other N-terminal-truncated CCL15 analogs were obtained by following a similar strategy to that described above, with the sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) replaced by other truncations in the construction of recombinant plasmids. GloSensor cAMP assay We fused a flag-tag into the N terminal of full-length CCR1, and cloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmids. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were transfected with a plasmid mixture consisting of pcDNA3.1-flag-CCR1 and the cAMP biosensor GloSensor-22F (Promega) at a ratio of 2:1. After 24 h, transfected cells were plated onto a 96-well plate, which was treated with cell adherent reagent (Applygen) in advance. After another 12 h, cells were treated with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution for starvation and then incubated in CO 2 -independent media containing 2% GloSensor cAMP Reagent (Promega) at a volume of 50 \u03bcl per well. Then 1 \u03bcM Forskolin (5.5 \u03bcl) (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before measurements for baseline luminescence (Spark Multimode microplate reader, TECAN). Next, test ligands (CCL15 variants, 6 \u03bcl) were added at different concentrations from 10 \u22126 to 10 \u221213 M. All luminescence values were first normalized by the initial counts before ligand treatments. Fold-change signals over the treatment of the lowest CCL15 concentration were used to show intracellular cAMP response. We carried out nonlinear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism to calculate the values of E max and half-maximum effective concentration (EC 50 ). Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay \u03b2-arrestin recruitment was measured by a BRET assay. The Rluc8 fragment was inserted into the C terminal of CCR1 (1\u2013327 aa) with a linker of 6*His. The Venus fragment was inserted into the N terminal of \u03b2-arrestin2. These sequences were then cloned into pBiT1.1 plasmids (Promega). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with CCR1-Rluc8 and Venus-\u03b2-arrestin2 (1:1). The transfected cells were seeded onto a cell adherent reagent (Applygen)-coated plate (Corning). After 48 h, cells were washed once and maintained in the buffer (5 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 0.01% BSA) at a volume of 20 \u00b5l per well. Then, the transfected cells were stimulated with ligands (5 \u00b5l) at different concentrations from (10 \u22126 to 10 \u221213 M) for 40 min. After the addition of luciferase substrate coelenterazine h (5 \u00b5M), the BRET signals were determined as the ratio of light emitted by Venus-tagged biosensors and light emitted by Rluc8-tagged biosensors. The BRET acceptor (520\u2013560 nm) and BRET donor (460\u2013485 nm) emission signals were measured using the Spark Multimode microplate reader (Tecan). Venus fluorescence was measured before reading luminescence and calculated as average fluorescence from each control well. The BRET signal from the same well was determined as the ratio of the light emitted by Venus (520\u2013560 nm) over that emitted by RLuc8 (460\u2013485 nm). We carried out nonlinear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism to calculate the values of E max and EC 50 . Flow cytometry-based endocytosis assays Human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC-TIB-202) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (Sangon). First, cells were plated on to a 96-well plate (Corning) and incubated with CCL15 truncations for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then the THP-1 cells were counterstained with allophycocyanin (APC) anti-CCR1 (Biolegend, used in 1:1,000 dilution) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (C 16 H 15 N 5 \u00b72HCl, Sigma, used in 1:10,000 dilution). DAPI (Thermo Fisher) staining was used to exclude dead cells. With the using of CytoFlex (Beckman CytoFlex), gating using Fourier shell correlation- (FSC-)A versus SSC-A was performed to exclude cell debris. FSC-H versus FSC-A was used to distinguish single cells. The endocytosis of CCR1 mutations was investigated by the use of HEK293T cells. So that the amount of CCR1 expression on infected HEK293T cells could be similar to the amount of endogenous CCR1 expressed on monocytes, we used the pBiT1.1 vector (Promega) with the HSV-TK promoter, which provided constitutive, low-level expression in mammalian cells. The recombined vector used in this assay also contained an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter downstream of the receptor and separated by a P2A self-cleaving peptide (ATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP). The transfected cells were incubated with corresponding CCL15 truncations for 2 h, and then stained with Phycoerythrin (PE) anti-DYKDDDDK Tag Antibody (Biolegend #637310, used in 1:1,000 dilution) and DAPI antibody (Sigma). The gate strategy was similar to that used in THP-1 cells as described above, except that the successful transfected HEK293T cells were further identified with high fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence. Data were acquired on a CytoFlex Cytometer and analyzed with CytExpert software. For THP-1 cells, the endocytosis level was measured by calculating the ratio of the median APC fluorescence intensity between THP-1 cells treated with ligand in a test and lowest concentration (10 \u221213 M). For HEK293T cells, the median PE fluorescence intensity was first normalized by the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate, then further divided by the corresponding value of HEK293T cells treated with ligand in the lowest concentration (10 \u221213 M). All data were normalized to 100% for presentation. We carried out nonlinear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism to calculate the values of E max and EC 50 . Purification of scFv16 The expression and purification of scFv16 were achieved as previously described 41 . In brief, the scFv16 was overexpressed and secreted into the culture medium of transfected High Five cells. Following affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA, the elution was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Then the monomeric fractions were concentrated, flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Expression and purification of CCL15 L \u2013CCR1-G i , CCL15 M \u2013CCR1-G i and apo CCR1\u2013G i complexes For the purification of CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i , the full-length cDNA sequence of wild-type human CCR1 was fused with a LgBiT subunit (Promega) at the C terminus followed by a double MBP tag via a GS linker containing a 3C protease cleavage site. The sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) was fused into the N terminus of CCR1 via a GS linker containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. A dominant-negative G\u03b1 i1 (DNG\u03b1 i1 ) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis to decrease the affinity of nucleotide-binding, and the G\u03b21 was fused with a C-terminal SmBiT (peptide 86, Promega). Using the bac-to-bac system (Invitrogen), the virus of CCL15 (26\u201392)\u2013CCR1-LgBiT-2*MBP was infected with the ones of G\u03b1 i1 and G\u03b2\u03b3-SmBiT at equal multiplicities of infection in SF9 insect cells. After 48 h of expression, the infected SF9 cells were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktail. The membranes were then solubilized with the addition of 0.5% (w/v) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol and 0.1% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccinate. Following incubation with Amylose resin (NEB), the protein was eluted with 10 mM maltose and treated with the TEV protease treatment to break the linker between chemokine and receptor, the 3C protease for the removal of 2*MBP protein, as well as the antibody scFv16 for complex stabilization. Finally, the purification of CCL15 (26\u201392)\u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex to homogeneity was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in size exclusion chromatography buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.00075% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol, 0.0002% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccinate and 0.00025% (w/v) glyco-diosgenin). The same strategy was used for the purification of CCL15 (27\u201392)\u2013CCR1\u2013G i and apo CCR1\u2013G i complex, except that the sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) was replaced by CCL15 (27\u201392) or CCL3 (4\u201369). N-terminal end sequencing based on mass spectrometry and sample preparation The cDNA sequence of CCL15 (22\u201392) was fused into the N terminus of CCR1 via a GS linker containing a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQS). Expression and purification of the CCL15 (22\u201392)\u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex were performed by following a strategy similar to that used for obtaining CCL15 L - and CL15 M -bound CCR1 complexes as described above. Monomeric fractions were loaded on 12.5% SDS\u2013PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The gel band corresponding to the ligand-receptor chimera was cut, digested and subjected to liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry analysis as described previously 42 . Briefly, the gel was destained in fixing buffer (50% (v/v) methanol, 5% (v/v) acetic acid in water). Following reduction and alkylation, the peptides were digested with trypsin. The peptides were extracted by using gradient acetonitrile and desalted by PierceTM C18 Spin Tips. The cleaned peptides were then separated using the Ultimate 3000 nanoliquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry system with a 30-min gradient and analyzed by QE-HFX (Thermo Fisher). The identification and quantification of sequences were analyzed by pFind (v.3.1.5). The search parameters were set as follows: carbamidomethylation of cysteine as the fixed modification, oxidation of methionine as the variable modification and trypsin as the digestion enzyme. The quantification results were ranked by spectra counts (propensity score matching <0.01). Cryo-EM grid preparation and data collection The purified CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound or apo CCR1\u2013G i complexes (3 \u03bcl) were applied onto a glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3) at roughly 5 mg ml \u22121 . The Grids were plunge into liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and subsequently transferred to liquid nitrogen and stored for data collection. Cryo-EM imaging was performed on a Titan Krios at 300 kV using Gatan K2 Summit detector in the Center of Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China). Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a dose rate of about 8.0 e \u00c5 2 s \u22121 with a defocus ranging from \u22121.0 to \u22123.0 \u03bcm using SerialEM software 43 . The total exposure time was 8 s and 40 frames were recorded per micrograph. A total of 5792, 6,230 and 5,431 videos were collected for the CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound or apo CCR1\u2013G i complex, respectively. Image processing and map construction Cryo-EM image stacks were aligned using MotionCor2 v.1.3.2 (ref. 44 ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated by Gctf v.1.18 (ref. 45 ). Particle selections for two-dimensional (2D) and 3D classifications were performed on a binned dataset with a pixel size of 2.028 \u00c5 using RELION v.3.0.8. For the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, 5,812,667 particles yielded by automated particle picking were subjected to 2D classification to discard fuzzy subsets of particles, producing 5,507,136 particles. The map of the NTSR1\u2013G i complex ( EMDB-20180 ) low-pass filtered to 60 \u00c5 was used as an initial reference model for two rounds of 3D classification, resulting in two well-defined subsets with 2,081,356 particles 46 . The selected subsets were subsequently subjected to 3D classification with a mask on the receptor. One subset shows the high-quality receptor density was selected, producing 1,090,180 particles. The selected subset was subsequently subjected to 3D refinement, CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing to reduce background noise and improve EM map quality. The final refinement generated a map with an indicated global resolution of 2.6 \u00c5 at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143. For the CCL15 M \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, 3,852,738 particles yielded by automated particle picking. Then particles were subjected to 2D and 3D classification to discard fuzzy subsets of particles, producing 1,336,807 particles. The map of the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, low-pass filtered to 60 \u00c5, was used as an initial reference model for the 3D classification, resulting in two well-defined subsets. The selected subsets were subsequently subjected to 3D classification with a mask on the receptor and ligand CCL15 M . One subset shows the high-quality receptor density was selected, producing 423,872 particles. The selected subset was subsequently subjected to 3D refinement, CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing to reduce background noise and improve EM map quality. The final refinement generated a map with an indicated global resolution of 2.7 \u00c5 at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143. For the apo CCR1\u2013G i complex, 3,252,536 particles yielded by automated particle picking were subjected to 2D classification to discard fuzzy subsets of particles, producing 2,073,895 particles. The map of CCL15 M \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex low-pass filtered to 40 \u00c5 was used as an initial reference model for a round of 3D classification, resulting in a well-defined subset with 965,870 particles. The selected subset was subsequently subjected to two rounds of 3D classification with a mask on the receptor and part of the G protein. Two subsets showing the high-quality density were selected, producing 391,181 particles. The selected particles were subsequently subjected to 3D refinement and the final refinement generated a map with an indicated global resolution of 2.9 \u00c5 at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143. All local resolutions of these complexes were determined using the Bsoft package (v.2.0.7) with half maps as input maps 47 . Model building and refinement For the structure of the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, the initial model of CCR1 was downloaded from the predicted active CCR1 model from GPCRdb, and the initial CCL15 model was built from the NMR CCL15 structure (PDB ID 2HCC ) 48 . The initial G i and scFv16 complex was generated from the NTSR1\u2013G i complex (PDB ID 6OS9 ) 46 . Then, the CCL15 L \u2013bound CCR1-G i model was used as the initial models of apo and CCL15 M -bound CCR1\u2013G i complexes. The models were docked into the cryo-EM density map using chimera. After the initial docked models were refined using Rosetta, the models were subjected to iterative rounds of manual adjustment and auto refinement in Coot v.0.9.4 and Phenix v.1.18, respectively. The final refinement scores were validated by the module \u2018comprehensive validation (cryo-EM)\u2019 in Phenix. The model versus map FSC was used to analysis the fitting of the refined model to the cryo-EM map. The model versus two half maps FSC curves were also compared to avoid the overfitting of model toward the map. Structure figures were prepared by PyMOL v.2.5, Chimera v.1.15 and ChiemraX v.1.2.5. Ligand bias calculated by NanoBiT assays The NanoBiT assay performed for the measurement of G protein activation was performed as previously described 46 . And for the measurement of ligand-induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, the LgBiT was inserted into the C terminal of CCR1 (1\u2013327 amino acids (aa)), and the SmBiT was N terminally fused to \u03b2-arrestin2. These sequences were then cloned into pBiT1.1 plasmids (Promega) to achieve a low-level expression in mammalian cells. These two plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells in equal proportions. After 24 h of incubation, the transfected cells were plated onto a plate (Corning), which was treated with cell adherent reagent (Applygen) in advance. After another 12 h of incubation, the transfected cells were washed once with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution buffer, and then maintained in the same buffer containing 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA and 5 \u00b5M coelenterazine h (yeasen) at a volume of 25 \u03bcl per well. After incubation for 30 min, the plate was measured for baseline luminescence (Spark Multimode microplate reader, TECAN). Every ligand (5 \u03bcl) was added at different concentrations from (10 \u22126 to 10 \u221213 M) before second measurement. Luminescence counts were normalized to the initial count. Fold-change signals over the lowest concentration treatment of corresponding ligand were calculated. Finally, data were normalized to 100% of the maximal CCL15 (27\u201392) response for wild-type CCR1 using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism.

Parameters used in this equation were based on the curve fits of the combined datasets described above. Molecular dynamics simulations CCL15 L -bound, CCL15 M -bound and apo state of CCR1 models were substrate from the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i , CCL15 M \u2013CCR1\u2013G i and apo CCR1\u2013G i complexes, respectively. The orientations of receptors are calculated by the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes database. Following that, the whole systems were prepared by the CHARM-GUI and embedded in a bilayer consisting of 200 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids by replacement methods. The membrane systems were then solvated into a periodic TIP3P water box supplemented with 0.15 M NaCl. The CHARMM36m Force Field was used to model protein molecules. Then these systems were subjected to minimization for 10,000 steps using the conjugated gradient algorithm, and then heated and equilibrated at 310.13 K and 1 atm for 200 ps with 10.0 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 harmonic restraints in the NAMD v.2.13. Then there were five cycles of equilibration for 2 ns each at 310.13 K and 1 atm, at which the harmonic restraints were 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 in sequence. Production simulations were run at 310.13 K and 1 atm in the NPT ensemble using the Langevin thermostat and Nose\u2013Hoover method for 250 ns. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method with a cutoff of 12 \u00c5. Throughout the final stages of equilibration and production, 5.0 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 harmonic restraints were placed on the residues of two state CCR1 models that were within 5 \u00c5 of ligand CCL15 include the five key residues (T86 2.56 , W90 2.60 , Y113 3.32 , Y255 6.51 , Y291 7.43 ) related to biased signaling. Trajectories were visualized and analyzed using VMD v.1.9.3. The representative r.m.s.d. analysis presented in Extended Data Fig. 1a was performed by Origin2018, and statistical analysis of Extended Data Fig. 1b was performed by GraphPad Prism v.7. Flow cytometric analysis of the receptor expression Flow cytometric analyses were performed by using CytoFlex (Beckman CytoFlex). The transfected cells were stained with PE anti-flag (Biolegend). Cells were gated by FSC-A versus SSC-A to exclude debris and then by FSC-H versus FSC-W to exclude cell doublets. Single cell APC fluorescence intensities were determined from over 3000 cells per experiment, which reflected the membrane protein expression level. All data of mutated CCR1 were normalized to the expression level of wild-type receptor in the same experiment. Values were shown as a percentage of the wild-type, which was set to 100%.

Our structure of CCL15-bound CCR1 also exhibited a critical site for ligand binding distinct from many other chemokine-receptor complexes, providing new insights into the mode of chemokine recognition.\n\npmc Nat Chem Biol Nat Chem Biol Nature Chemical Biology 1552-4450 1552-4469 Nature Publishing Group US New York 8885419 34949837 918 10.1038/s41589-021-00918-z Article Identification and mechanism of G protein-biased ligands for chemokine receptor CCR1 http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2719-950X Shao Zhehua 1 http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6602-7116 Shen Qingya 2 3 Yao Bingpeng 4 http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5349-8592 Mao Chunyou 2 3 Chen Li-Nan 2 3 http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3025-0185 Zhang Huibing 2 3 http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8757-4602 Shen Dan-Dan 2 3 Zhang Chao 1 5 Li Weijie 1 http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1161-0130 Du Xufei 1 Li Fei 1 Ma Honglei 6 7 Chen Zhi-Hua 1 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6829-8144 Xu H.

Biased signaling of G protein-coupled receptors describes an ability of different ligands that preferentially activate an alternative downstream signaling pathway. In this work, we identified and characterized different N-terminal truncations of endogenous chemokine CCL15 as balanced or biased agonists targeting CCR1, and presented three cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of the CCR1\u2013G i complex in the ligand-free form or bound to different CCL15 truncations with a resolution of 2.6\u20132.9 \u00c5, illustrating the structural basis of natural biased signaling that initiates an inflammation response. Complemented with pharmacological and computational studies, these structures revealed it was the conformational change of Tyr291 (Y291 7.43 ) in CCR1 that triggered its polar network rearrangement in the orthosteric binding pocket and allosterically regulated the activation of \u03b2-arrestin signaling. Our structure of CCL15-bound CCR1 also exhibited a critical site for ligand binding distinct from many other chemokine\u2013receptor complexes, providing new insights into the mode of chemokine recognition. Cryo-EM structures of the CCR1\u2013G i complex with N-terminal truncations of the endogenous chemokine CCL15 revealed that the conformational change of Tyr291 in CCR1 regulates \u03b2-arrestin signaling.

In most cases, the activation of G proteins and \u03b2-arrestin corresponds to their own respective downstream effectors, thus performing distinct biological functions 3 . Specific ligands at some GPCRs, such as the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT 1 R), the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), the \u03bc-opioid receptor (\u03bcOR) and the kappa opioid receptor (\u03baOR), have been demonstrated to preferentially stimulate the G protein or \u03b2\u2010arrestin signaling pathways 4 \u2013 7 . This phenomenon is termed \u2018biased signaling\u2019, provides new insights into GPCR biology and has a broad prospect of clinical applications, since selective activation or inhibition of specific signaling cascades has been proved to increase the therapeutic use of drugs targeting GPCRs with minimal side effects. Nevertheless, understanding of molecular mechanism underlining biased signaling has so far remained a challenging task 3 . Chemokine\u2013receptor interactions play an essential role in guiding leukocyte trafficking in immune surveillance and inflammation response 8 , 9 . According to the number and position of conserved cysteine residues in their N-terminal regions, chemokines are classified as cysteine, cysteine cysteine, cysteine X cysteine (CXC) and cysteine X3 cysteines (CX3C) subsets 10 \u2013 12 . So far, at least 50 endogenous chemokines and 20 chemokine receptors have been identified in humans. The interactions between chemokines and their receptors exhibit considerable promiscuity, wherein most receptors can be recognized by multiple chemokines and most chemokines can activate multiple receptors. These chemokine\u2013receptor interactions were previously regarded as redundant, but it is now appreciated that many chemokine interactions display biased agonism, enabling the fine-tuning of a chemokine-induced physiological response 3 , 13 . Among the chemokine receptor family, the chemokine receptor CCR1 unusually exhibits the most ligand promiscuity, which can recognize at least nine human cysteine cysteine chemokines, including CCL3, CCL5-9 (CCL6 and CCL9 are murine), CCL13\u201316 and CCL23 (refs. 9 , 11 , 14 ). CCR1 is widely expressed in various immune cells, and the knockdown of CCR1 has proved effective in suppressing the maturation and migration of immune cells, thus being regarded as an attractive drug target for the treatment of many autoimmune and allergic diseases, such as asthma 15 \u2013 18 . Structure-based sequence alignment of CCR1 agonists shows high divergences at the N terminus, with the core region exhibiting conserved similarity, indicating that the N terminus of chemokines contributes to different signal transduction properties of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a ). CCL15 is an endogenous ligand of CCR1 at which the N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved up on its secretion to extracellular media. Identified by mass spectrometry of clinical samples, the N terminus of secreted CCL15 underwent further cleavage and exhibited different N-terminal truncations due to proteolytic processing mediated by activated mast cells and neutrophils 19 , 20 . For instance, CCL15 (22\u201392) was generated after digestion by either chymase or cathepsin G, while CCL15 (29\u201392) was produced by elastase treatment of CCL15 (ref. 19 ). More and more studies have suggested that the N terminus of chemokines worked as a determinant for CCR1 activation, as well as giving rise to biased agonism 21 , 22 . In this study, we found that compared to the longer form of CCL15 N-terminal truncation (CCL15 (26\u201392), termed CCL15 L ), the shorter forms of CCL15 N-terminal truncations (CCL15 (27\u201392), termed CCL15 M , and CCL15 from (28\u201392) to (31\u201392), termed CCL15 S ) displayed poor efficacy in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, thus performing stronger bias toward G protein pathways. To develop an understanding of the structural features that contributes to the biased signaling of CCR1, we determined three cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human CCR1\u2013G i complexes either in the absence of ligand (apo) or in bound to CCL15 L or CCL15 M . Together with mutagenesis and functional studies, our results provide a new molecular mechanism to explain biased signaling of CCR1 and reveal the diverse binding modes of chemokine receptors that contribute to ligand-selective recognition. Results Biased signaling of CCR1 induced by CCL15 To study the mechanism for CCL15-mediated activation of CCR1, we purified CCL15 (22\u201392) from insect cells, which was reported as the longest N-terminal digestion product 19 . Identified by mass spectrometry, we found that the first determined residue of the CCL15 N terminus in the G i -coupled complex was F26, and the main forms of CCL15 truncations involved in complex formation were CCL15 (26\u201392), CCL15 (27\u201392), CCL15 (29\u201392) and CCL15 (30\u201392) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b ). This phenomenon is consistent with the fact that physiological fluids, proinflammatory proteases or human cell supernatants can truncate the N termini of the cognate chemokines of CCR1, such as CCL6, CCL9, CCL15 and CCL23, thereby enabling the cleaved ligands to activate the receptor 19 , 20 .

N = 8 independent experiments, performed with single replicates. In d , e , all data are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Source data Therefore, we separately purified N-terminal truncations of CCL15 from (26\u201392) to (31\u201392) and measured their effects on both G proteins and \u03b2-arrestin pathways. All N-terminal truncations of CCL15 exhibited almost the same or with only slightly reduced potency on G protein activation, but removal of the first two N-terminal amino acids, CCL15 truncations from (28\u201392) to (31\u201392), generated a strong decline in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2c ). These results were in good agreement with the endocytosis of CCR1 in human monocytic THP-1 cells treated with corresponding N-terminal truncations, which was proposed to be mediated by \u03b2-arrestin pathway (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2d ) 1 . Thus, compared with CCL15 (26\u201392) and CCL15 (27\u201392), all the shorter variants, from CCL15 (28\u201392) to CCL15 (31\u201392), exhibited strong bias toward G i -protein pathway (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1 ). These results were consistent with previous reports on CCR1 that CCL15 (29\u201392) was biased toward both G\u03b1 i activation and cAMP inhibition relative to CCL15 (27\u201392) 22 . Based on the above results, we anticipated that the N terminus of CCL15 was critical for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment when these truncations displayed low nanomolar potency albeit with reduced efficacy. Therefore, we grouped these N-terminal truncations of CCL15 into three categories: (1) CCL15 (26\u201392), which was a long form CCL15 (CCL15 L ) and showed a bias toward \u03b2-arrestin pathway; (2) CCL15 (27\u201392), which was a medium form CCL15 (CCL15 M ) and displayed balanced activation between G protein and \u03b2-arrestin pathways and (3) CCL15 truncations from (28\u201392) to (31\u201392), which were short forms of CCL15 (CCL15 S ) and were the strong G protein-biased agonists of CCR1. These findings revealed that the N-terminal region of CCL15 was not essential for CCR1-mediated G protein signaling, but critical for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, suggesting the natural biased agonism of chemokine receptors under physiological conditions. Cryo-EM structures of three CCR1\u2013G i complexes To investigate the molecular basis of signaling bias of CCR1, we aimed to obtain the structures of active CCR1 bound to CCL15 variants of different N-terminal truncations that displayed different bias profiles. The wild-type full-length human CCR1 and different ligands were coexpressed in insect cells for complex formation. A NanoBiT tethering strategy was used for complex stabilization (Extended Data Fig. 3 ) 23 , 24 . By using cryo-EM analyses, three structures of CCR1-G i complexes in CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound and apo states were determined at overall resolutions of 2.6, 2.7 and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively. Most side chains in the ligand and the seven transmembrane (7TM) domain of CCR1 in all three complexes could be clearly defined and enabled us to build and refine the near-atomic resolution structures of these complexes (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5 ). Fig. 2 Cryo-EM structures of CCR1\u2013G i complexes in the CCL15 L -, CCL15 M - bound and apo states. a , c , e , Cryo-EM density maps of CCR1-G i complexes bound to CCL15 L ( a ), CCL15 M ( c ) and in the apo state ( e ). b , d , f , Models of CCR1\u2013G i complexes in three states (left).

Atomic models and EM density shown as sticks and surfaces, respectively. EM density of CCL15 L and CCL15 M shown as a mesh. Globally, all these CCR1 structures were similar to each other in their backbone conformations (Extended Data Fig. 6 ), suggesting a common conformation for G protein activation of CCR1 among these structures. In addition, the structure of the apo CCR1\u2013G i complex resembles the CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound CCR1\u2013G i complexes, except that for the bottom of the ligand-binding pockets in apo CCR1 was empty. The formation of the CCR1\u2013G i complex in the absence of the ligand was consistent with CCR1, which exhibited higher basal activity of G i signaling compared to other chemokine receptors such as CCR2, CCR5 and CCR10 (ref. 25 ). Recognition of CCR1 by CCL15 The recognition of a ligand by chemokine receptors is a complex process that is still not fully understood 26 \u2013 28 . Since the structural alignment of CCL15 L - and CCL15 M -CCR1 complexes revealed almost the same binding mode between the ligand and receptor, we used the structure of CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 complex as a model for clarity of presentation to explore the mode of CCL15 binding to CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). So far, only a few high-resolution structures of chemokine receptors in complex with chemokines have been resolved 29 \u2013 33 . As shown in Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013d , the orientation of the globular core of CCL15 L to CCR1 was similar to that of CCL5 5P7 bound to CCR5 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 5UIW ), but rotated by about 50\u00b0 when compared to the corresponding chemokines in the CCL20\u2013CCR6 (PDB ID 6WWZ ) and CXCL8\u2013CXCR2 (PDB ID 6LFL ) complexes, suggesting that diverse recognition modes exist among these chemokine\u2013receptor interactions 29 \u2013 31 . According to the classic \u2018two-site\u2019 model, the binding of chemokines to receptors involves two main interaction sites: (1) the chemokine recognition site 1 (CRS1), where the N terminus of the receptor interacts with the globular core of the chemokine and (2) the chemokine recognition site 2 (CRS2), where the N terminus of the chemokine interacts with the transmembrane binding pocket of the receptor 32 , 34 . The CCL15 L -bound CCR1 structure shows that the CCL15 L is stably anchored in the extracellular half of the receptor 7TM domain and inserts deeply into the helical bundle (Fig. 3a ). At the CRS1, the N terminus of CCR1 (residue D 17 YGDATPCQK 26 ) ran parallel with the N-loop region of CCL15 L and fitted onto the groove formed by the N-loop and \u03b23 strands of CCL15 L , corresponding to a surface buried area of 745 \u00c5 2 (740.4 \u00c5 2 in CCL15 M \u2013CCR1) (Fig. 3a\u2013c and Supplementary Table 3 ). Although the electron microscopy (EM) maps of both CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 and CCL15 M \u2013CCR1 only revealed the resolved density starting from the residue D17 NT in the N terminus of CCR1, the various N-terminal truncations of the first 20 residues of CCR1 retained partial activities of CCL15-induced G protein activation as determined by NanoBiT assay. Furthermore, the deletion of the first 25 residues of CCR1 almost eliminated CCL15-induced receptor activity, suggesting that the CCR1 N terminus plays a critical role in ligand recognition and receptor activation (Fig. 3d ). At the CRS2, the N terminus of CCL15 L inserted into the pocket within the 7TM domain in a position that was notably deeper than other chemokines bound to the corresponding chemokine receptors (Extended Data Fig. 7e ). As shown in Fig. 3e , the most N-terminal residue of CCL15 L , F26, faced toward the minor pocket formed by L87 2.57 , W90 2.60 , Y113 3.32 and Y291 7.43 . The backbone amide of H27 formed a hydrogen bond with E287 7.39 (superscripts indicate the Ballesteros\u2013Weinstein numbering scheme) 35 , consistent with the fact that the critical role of residue E287 7.39 , which is found in 74% of chemokine receptors and is crucial for chemokine-induced activity in many chemokine receptors 36 , 37 . Meanwhile, mutations of these F26-binding residues were previously reported to decrease the inhibitory effect of CCR1-targed small-molecule antagonists, suggesting that they were also important for activity of the antagonists 38 , 39 . It was also noteworthy that there were two side chain to side chain hydrogen bonds formed between H27 and D280 7.32 , D31 and Q25 NT , respectively (Fig. 3e ).

Hydrogen bonds are depicted as dashed lines. Source data Besides the two classical chemokine recognition sites as discussed above, CCL5 5P7 was previously reported interacting with CCR5 through an epitope designated as the CRS1.5, where the 19 PC 20 motif of CCR5 packed against the conserved disulfide of its ligand 29 . CRS1.5 was also observed in the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 complex, with hydrogen bonds forming between C24 NT and CCL15 (Extended Data Fig. 7g ). In agreement with that, C24 NT A substitution significantly impaired the activation of the receptor (Extended Data Fig. 7h ). Furthermore, additional interactions were observed between CCL15 L and CCR1, where \u03b21-\u03b22 strands and the 30s loop (residue 50 FETSSECS 57 ) of CCL15 L were found to interact with ECLs 2\u20133, and with TMs 5\u20136 of CCR1 (Fig. 3f\u2013h ). This recognition site was also observed in the CCL5 [5P7] \u2013CCR5 complex, which was designated as the CRS3 hereafter. The buried surface areas of the CRS3 of CCR1 (700 \u00c5 2 in CCL15 L \u2013CCR1 and 748.2 \u00c5 2 in CCL15 M \u2013CCR1, respectively) were comparable to the corresponding area in the CCL5 5P7 \u2013CCR5 complex (698.5 \u00c5 2 ), far more significant than that in other chemokine receptor structures including the CXCL8\u2013CXCR2 (300 \u00c5 2 ) and CCL20-CCR6 (448 \u00c5 2 ) complexes (Supplementary Table 3 ). The CCL15 L \u03b21 strand ran antiparallel with ECL2 of CCR1 where these two parts interacted with each other primarily through hydrophobic effects. Meanwhile, the 30s loop of CCL15 L submerged into the 7TM pocket of CCR1, where it made contact with ECL2 and ECL3, and with TM5 and TM6 through comprehensive hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3g,h ). Sequence alignment showed that the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 strands and the 30s loop were relatively more conserved than the N-loop among the endogenous ligands of CCR1, indicating the CRS3 might be a major determinant for ligand binding of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a ). Y 7.43 acted as a \u2018toggle switch\u2019 for biased signaling It is widely accepted that interactions between biased agonists and GPCRs result in the stabilization of a unique conformation adopted by the receptor that preferentially activates one downstream signaling 2 . Structural comparison of the extracellular pocket core of CCR1 among CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound and apo states was performed for the study of biased signaling. In the extracellular pocket core of apo CCR1, the side chain of Y291 7.43 pointed toward TM2, forming hydrogen bonds with T86 2.56 and W90 2.60 (Fig. 4a ). On the binding of the CCL15 L into the 7TM pocket of CCR1, the aromatic group of CCL15 F26 formed strong interactions with W90 2.60 and Y291 7.43 . Hence, the resulting steric hindrance pushed the side chain of W90 2.60 and Y291 7.43 to sway from their original positions by 46\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, respectively, thereby breaking the Y291 7.43 \u2013W90 2.60 \u2013T86 2.56 polar network (Extended Data Fig. 8a ). Consequently, the released Y291 7.43 then formed hydrogen bonds with Y113 3.32 and Y255 6.51 , establishing CCR1 in a conformation favorable for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment without strongly influencing G protein signaling (Figs. 1e and 4b ). The density of Y 7.43 in the CCL15 M \u2013CCR1 complex displayed two alternative conformations, with one conformation resembling the CCL15 L -bound state and the other resembling the apo CCR1 state (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8b ). These findings illustrated that the CCL15 M -induced conformation of Y 7.43 was flexible and therefore retained partial capability of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, which accounted reasonably well for the functional results (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2c ).

The asterisk symbols indicate statistically significant difference ( P = 0.042 and 0.0003, from top to bottom, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001). In d \u2013 h , all data are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Source data Consistently, the variance of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment among all CCL15 N-terminal truncations was significantly decreased with alanine substitution of Y291 7.43 in CCR1. By contrast, the effect of Y291 7.43 A mutation on G protein activation was relatively smaller, resulting in a strong decline in signaling bias of most CCL15 S truncations compared to CCL15 M (Fig. 4d,e , Extended Data Fig. 8c and Supplementary Table 5 ). As shown in Extended Data Fig. 8d,e , a Y291 7.43 A mutation significantly enhanced the CCL15 S -induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment pathway of CCR1, but hardly influenced either the CCL15 S -induced G protein activation or any downstream signaling induced by CCL15 L . A phenylalanine mutation of Y291 7.43 in CCR1 was observed to be not strong enough to destroy the biased signaling induced by CCL15 S (Extended Data Fig. 8f ). Taken together, these results indicate that it was the hydrophobic interaction between F26 and Y291 7.43 that triggered the conformational change of Y291 7.43 , playing a critical role in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. The side chain of Y291 7.43 seemed to be unfavorable for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment in the presence of CCL15 S . Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations of CCR1 with the protein removed showed that three distinctive structural configurations in the orthosteric pocket induced different conformational dynamics at the cytoplasmic half of the receptor, especially at the TM1, TM7 and H8 regions. These results indicate the differential conformational dynamics in response to the extracellular polar network exchange, which might contribute to the natural biased agonism of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, mutations of the complementary residues in the polar networks including the T86 2.56 A/W90 2.60 A and the Y113 3.32 F/Y255 6.51 F mutations, were also observed to reduce the difference of signal bias between CCL15 S and CCL15 L , suggesting that the residues within this region were important for signal transduction of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 10a\u2013e ). It should be mentioned that the mutation of Y113 3.32 A/Y255 6.51 A lead to an almost complete loss of CCR1 expression localized on plasma membrane, suggesting that the residues of Y113 3.32 and Y255 6.51 participated in maintaining the three-dimensional (3D) structure of CCR1 (Extended Data Fig. 10f ). The T86 2.56 A/W90 2.60 A mutant displayed an increased signaling bias toward \u03b2-arrestin pathway, while the Y113 3.32 F/Y255 6.51 F mutation increased the bias toward G protein signaling (Fig. 4f-h and Supplementary Table 6 ). Taken together, these results demonstrated that distinct rotamers of Y291 7.43 in CCR1 served as a sensor to discriminate different forms of CCL15 truncations, and mutations that disturbed the equilibrium balance of the intracellular polar network of Y291 7.43 triggered biased signaling of CCR1. Discussion Innate immune cells express multiple chemokine receptors and chemokines to control their migration, activation, differentiation and survival. At a cellular level, chemokines can synergize or antagonize with each other for downstream signal transduction. For instance, chemokine receptors not only could be stimulated by chemokines for G protein recruitments, but also undergo internalization on some chemokine agonist binding, leading to impairment of other chemokines\u2019 efficacies. Therefore, molecular mechanisms of chemokine regulation and signaling bias of chemokine receptors are required for understanding of their functional intricacies. In this paper, we identified and characterized the biased signaling properties of different CCL15 variants and their binding to CCR1. While the longer form of CCL15 (CCL15 L ) displayed \u03b2-arrestin-biased signaling, the shorter forms of CCL15 (CCL15 S ) showed gradual biased agonism toward G i -mediated signaling (Fig. 1 ). The cryo-EM structures we reported here complemented the molecular mechanisms of immunomodulation induced by these endogenous chemokines. Structural alignments revealed that CCL15 resembled an orientation similar to CCL5 [5P7] \u2013CCR5 (PDB ID 5UIW ), but rotated by about 50\u00b0 when compared to other chemokine\u2013receptor complexes. This phenomenon suggested that at least two distinct binding modes existed in the chemokine recognition system (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013d ). In addition, both the CCL15\u2013CCR1 and CCL5 [5P7] \u2013CCR5 complexes showed a new recognition site (the CRS3), where the 30s loop of the ligand was submerged into the 7TM pocket of its receptor, demonstrating it is a major determinant for ligand binding of CCR1 and CCR3. Structural comparisons and functional experiments confirmed that conformational rearrangement of Y 7.43 and exchange of polar networks in the orthosteric binding pocket of CCR1 lead to strongly biased signaling. In particular, the longer form of CCL15 (CCL15 L ), which has a significant interaction with Y 7.43 , displayed strong activation of both G i protein and \u03b2-arrestin pathways. The shorter forms of CCL15 forms (CCL15 S ) have impaired ability to activate the \u03b2-arrestin pathway but not G i -mediated signaling, making them endogenous biased agonists prone to stimulating the G protein pathway. Y 7.43 is conserved over 90 class A GPCRs, and 65 class A GPCRs have at least one polar residue at both polar network sides, including the \u03bcOR, \u03baOR and AT 1 R (Supplementary Table 7 ). In two recent studies on the AT 1 R, Y 7.43 was also found to be important for the allosteric regulation of receptor conformations in response to ligands with different bias profiles 4 , 40 . Unlike our observation in CCR1, Y 7.43 in AT 1 R was proposed to be critical for ligand-dependent coupling of Gq signaling rather than \u03b2-arrestin coupling. Although the ultimate response to the movement of Y 7.43 in CCR1 and AT 1 R was different, Y 7.43 in both receptors was involved in determining the conformation of the intracellular half of TM7, and played a critical role in modulating downstream signaling. The side chain of Y 7.43 in both CCL15 M \u2013CCR1 and AngII-AT 1 R complexes displayed highly dynamic changes, which seemed to be typical for more balanced ligands. Together, our results provide structural insights into chemokine recognition, biased signaling and pharmacology of CCR1. Although CCR1 has been regarded as a candidate target for autoimmune and allergic diseases for a long time, the success of CCR1-targeted drug development has been limited. Manipulating the conformational exchange of the polar networks in the receptor orthosteric binding pocket to achieve bias signaling could be a general framework for the GPCRs with the conserved Y 7.43 , allowing rational design of biased ligands with an ultimate aim to achieve function-selective therapeutics with fewer side effects. Methods Expression and purification of CCL15 N-terminal truncations The full-length of human CCL15 (1\u201392) complementary DNA was bought from Miaolingbio. The sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) was cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector, containing a GP67 signal peptide at the N terminus before the ligand to facilitate protein secretion. A maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag followed by a C-terminal 8*His tag was fused into the C terminal of CCL15 (26\u201392) with a linker containing a 3C protease cleavage site (LEVLFQGP). Using the bac-to-bac system, CCL15 (26\u201392)-3C-MBP-8*His was overexpressed by High Five insect cells. Insect cell cultures were grown in protein-free insect cell culture medium (Expression Systems ESF 921). After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and the initial purification was performed using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare). CCL15 (26\u201392)-3C-MBP-8*His was eluted with high imidazole elution buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole). Then, the removal of C-terminal MBP and 8*His tag were achieved by 3C protease digestion (1:100). Next, 10% (w/v) glycerol was added together with 3C protease. Finally, purification to homogeneity of CCL15 (26\u201392) was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on a SuperdexTM 75 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in size exclusion chromatography buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol), with the separation of CCL15 (26\u201392), 3C protease and MPB. About 1 mg of target proteins could be obtained from 1 l of culture medium. The other N-terminal-truncated CCL15 analogs were obtained by following a similar strategy to that described above, with the sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) replaced by other truncations in the construction of recombinant plasmids. GloSensor cAMP assay We fused a flag-tag into the N terminal of full-length CCR1, and cloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmids. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were transfected with a plasmid mixture consisting of pcDNA3.1-flag-CCR1 and the cAMP biosensor GloSensor-22F (Promega) at a ratio of 2:1. After 24 h, transfected cells were plated onto a 96-well plate, which was treated with cell adherent reagent (Applygen) in advance. After another 12 h, cells were treated with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution for starvation and then incubated in CO 2 -independent media containing 2% GloSensor cAMP Reagent (Promega) at a volume of 50 \u03bcl per well. Then 1 \u03bcM Forskolin (5.5 \u03bcl) (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before measurements for baseline luminescence (Spark Multimode microplate reader, TECAN). Next, test ligands (CCL15 variants, 6 \u03bcl) were added at different concentrations from 10 \u22126 to 10 \u221213 M. All luminescence values were first normalized by the initial counts before ligand treatments. Fold-change signals over the treatment of the lowest CCL15 concentration were used to show intracellular cAMP response. We carried out nonlinear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism to calculate the values of E max and half-maximum effective concentration (EC 50 ). Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay \u03b2-arrestin recruitment was measured by a BRET assay. The Rluc8 fragment was inserted into the C terminal of CCR1 (1\u2013327 aa) with a linker of 6*His. The Venus fragment was inserted into the N terminal of \u03b2-arrestin2. These sequences were then cloned into pBiT1.1 plasmids (Promega). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with CCR1-Rluc8 and Venus-\u03b2-arrestin2 (1:1). The transfected cells were seeded onto a cell adherent reagent (Applygen)-coated plate (Corning). After 48 h, cells were washed once and maintained in the buffer (5 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 0.01% BSA) at a volume of 20 \u00b5l per well. Then, the transfected cells were stimulated with ligands (5 \u00b5l) at different concentrations from (10 \u22126 to 10 \u221213 M) for 40 min. After the addition of luciferase substrate coelenterazine h (5 \u00b5M), the BRET signals were determined as the ratio of light emitted by Venus-tagged biosensors and light emitted by Rluc8-tagged biosensors. The BRET acceptor (520\u2013560 nm) and BRET donor (460\u2013485 nm) emission signals were measured using the Spark Multimode microplate reader (Tecan). Venus fluorescence was measured before reading luminescence and calculated as average fluorescence from each control well. The BRET signal from the same well was determined as the ratio of the light emitted by Venus (520\u2013560 nm) over that emitted by RLuc8 (460\u2013485 nm). We carried out nonlinear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism to calculate the values of E max and EC 50 . Flow cytometry-based endocytosis assays Human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC-TIB-202) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (Sangon). First, cells were plated on to a 96-well plate (Corning) and incubated with CCL15 truncations for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then the THP-1 cells were counterstained with allophycocyanin (APC) anti-CCR1 (Biolegend, used in 1:1,000 dilution) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (C 16 H 15 N 5 \u00b72HCl, Sigma, used in 1:10,000 dilution). DAPI (Thermo Fisher) staining was used to exclude dead cells. With the using of CytoFlex (Beckman CytoFlex), gating using Fourier shell correlation- (FSC-)A versus SSC-A was performed to exclude cell debris. FSC-H versus FSC-A was used to distinguish single cells. The endocytosis of CCR1 mutations was investigated by the use of HEK293T cells. So that the amount of CCR1 expression on infected HEK293T cells could be similar to the amount of endogenous CCR1 expressed on monocytes, we used the pBiT1.1 vector (Promega) with the HSV-TK promoter, which provided constitutive, low-level expression in mammalian cells. The recombined vector used in this assay also contained an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter downstream of the receptor and separated by a P2A self-cleaving peptide (ATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP). The transfected cells were incubated with corresponding CCL15 truncations for 2 h, and then stained with Phycoerythrin (PE) anti-DYKDDDDK Tag Antibody (Biolegend #637310, used in 1:1,000 dilution) and DAPI antibody (Sigma). The gate strategy was similar to that used in THP-1 cells as described above, except that the successful transfected HEK293T cells were further identified with high fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence. Data were acquired on a CytoFlex Cytometer and analyzed with CytExpert software. For THP-1 cells, the endocytosis level was measured by calculating the ratio of the median APC fluorescence intensity between THP-1 cells treated with ligand in a test and lowest concentration (10 \u221213 M). For HEK293T cells, the median PE fluorescence intensity was first normalized by the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate, then further divided by the corresponding value of HEK293T cells treated with ligand in the lowest concentration (10 \u221213 M). All data were normalized to 100% for presentation. We carried out nonlinear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism to calculate the values of E max and EC 50 . Purification of scFv16 The expression and purification of scFv16 were achieved as previously described 41 . In brief, the scFv16 was overexpressed and secreted into the culture medium of transfected High Five cells. Following affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA, the elution was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Then the monomeric fractions were concentrated, flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Expression and purification of CCL15 L \u2013CCR1-G i , CCL15 M \u2013CCR1-G i and apo CCR1\u2013G i complexes For the purification of CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i , the full-length cDNA sequence of wild-type human CCR1 was fused with a LgBiT subunit (Promega) at the C terminus followed by a double MBP tag via a GS linker containing a 3C protease cleavage site. The sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) was fused into the N terminus of CCR1 via a GS linker containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. A dominant-negative G\u03b1 i1 (DNG\u03b1 i1 ) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis to decrease the affinity of nucleotide-binding, and the G\u03b21 was fused with a C-terminal SmBiT (peptide 86, Promega). Using the bac-to-bac system (Invitrogen), the virus of CCL15 (26\u201392)\u2013CCR1-LgBiT-2*MBP was infected with the ones of G\u03b1 i1 and G\u03b2\u03b3-SmBiT at equal multiplicities of infection in SF9 insect cells. After 48 h of expression, the infected SF9 cells were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktail. The membranes were then solubilized with the addition of 0.5% (w/v) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol and 0.1% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccinate. Following incubation with Amylose resin (NEB), the protein was eluted with 10 mM maltose and treated with the TEV protease treatment to break the linker between chemokine and receptor, the 3C protease for the removal of 2*MBP protein, as well as the antibody scFv16 for complex stabilization. Finally, the purification of CCL15 (26\u201392)\u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex to homogeneity was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in size exclusion chromatography buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.00075% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol, 0.0002% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccinate and 0.00025% (w/v) glyco-diosgenin). The same strategy was used for the purification of CCL15 (27\u201392)\u2013CCR1\u2013G i and apo CCR1\u2013G i complex, except that the sequence of CCL15 (26\u201392) was replaced by CCL15 (27\u201392) or CCL3 (4\u201369). N-terminal end sequencing based on mass spectrometry and sample preparation The cDNA sequence of CCL15 (22\u201392) was fused into the N terminus of CCR1 via a GS linker containing a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQS). Expression and purification of the CCL15 (22\u201392)\u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex were performed by following a strategy similar to that used for obtaining CCL15 L - and CL15 M -bound CCR1 complexes as described above. Monomeric fractions were loaded on 12.5% SDS\u2013PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The gel band corresponding to the ligand-receptor chimera was cut, digested and subjected to liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry analysis as described previously 42 . Briefly, the gel was destained in fixing buffer (50% (v/v) methanol, 5% (v/v) acetic acid in water). Following reduction and alkylation, the peptides were digested with trypsin. The peptides were extracted by using gradient acetonitrile and desalted by PierceTM C18 Spin Tips. The cleaned peptides were then separated using the Ultimate 3000 nanoliquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry system with a 30-min gradient and analyzed by QE-HFX (Thermo Fisher). The identification and quantification of sequences were analyzed by pFind (v.3.1.5). The search parameters were set as follows: carbamidomethylation of cysteine as the fixed modification, oxidation of methionine as the variable modification and trypsin as the digestion enzyme. The quantification results were ranked by spectra counts (propensity score matching <0.01). Cryo-EM grid preparation and data collection The purified CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound or apo CCR1\u2013G i complexes (3 \u03bcl) were applied onto a glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3) at roughly 5 mg ml \u22121 . The Grids were plunge into liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and subsequently transferred to liquid nitrogen and stored for data collection. Cryo-EM imaging was performed on a Titan Krios at 300 kV using Gatan K2 Summit detector in the Center of Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China). Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a dose rate of about 8.0 e \u00c5 2 s \u22121 with a defocus ranging from \u22121.0 to \u22123.0 \u03bcm using SerialEM software 43 . The total exposure time was 8 s and 40 frames were recorded per micrograph. A total of 5792, 6,230 and 5,431 videos were collected for the CCL15 L -, CCL15 M -bound or apo CCR1\u2013G i complex, respectively. Image processing and map construction Cryo-EM image stacks were aligned using MotionCor2 v.1.3.2 (ref. 44 ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated by Gctf v.1.18 (ref. 45 ). Particle selections for two-dimensional (2D) and 3D classifications were performed on a binned dataset with a pixel size of 2.028 \u00c5 using RELION v.3.0.8. For the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, 5,812,667 particles yielded by automated particle picking were subjected to 2D classification to discard fuzzy subsets of particles, producing 5,507,136 particles. The map of the NTSR1\u2013G i complex ( EMDB-20180 ) low-pass filtered to 60 \u00c5 was used as an initial reference model for two rounds of 3D classification, resulting in two well-defined subsets with 2,081,356 particles 46 . The selected subsets were subsequently subjected to 3D classification with a mask on the receptor. One subset shows the high-quality receptor density was selected, producing 1,090,180 particles. The selected subset was subsequently subjected to 3D refinement, CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing to reduce background noise and improve EM map quality. The final refinement generated a map with an indicated global resolution of 2.6 \u00c5 at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143. For the CCL15 M \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, 3,852,738 particles yielded by automated particle picking. Then particles were subjected to 2D and 3D classification to discard fuzzy subsets of particles, producing 1,336,807 particles. The map of the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, low-pass filtered to 60 \u00c5, was used as an initial reference model for the 3D classification, resulting in two well-defined subsets. The selected subsets were subsequently subjected to 3D classification with a mask on the receptor and ligand CCL15 M . One subset shows the high-quality receptor density was selected, producing 423,872 particles. The selected subset was subsequently subjected to 3D refinement, CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing to reduce background noise and improve EM map quality. The final refinement generated a map with an indicated global resolution of 2.7 \u00c5 at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143. For the apo CCR1\u2013G i complex, 3,252,536 particles yielded by automated particle picking were subjected to 2D classification to discard fuzzy subsets of particles, producing 2,073,895 particles. The map of CCL15 M \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex low-pass filtered to 40 \u00c5 was used as an initial reference model for a round of 3D classification, resulting in a well-defined subset with 965,870 particles. The selected subset was subsequently subjected to two rounds of 3D classification with a mask on the receptor and part of the G protein. Two subsets showing the high-quality density were selected, producing 391,181 particles. The selected particles were subsequently subjected to 3D refinement and the final refinement generated a map with an indicated global resolution of 2.9 \u00c5 at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.143. All local resolutions of these complexes were determined using the Bsoft package (v.2.0.7) with half maps as input maps 47 . Model building and refinement For the structure of the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i complex, the initial model of CCR1 was downloaded from the predicted active CCR1 model from GPCRdb, and the initial CCL15 model was built from the NMR CCL15 structure (PDB ID 2HCC ) 48 . The initial G i and scFv16 complex was generated from the NTSR1\u2013G i complex (PDB ID 6OS9 ) 46 . Then, the CCL15 L \u2013bound CCR1-G i model was used as the initial models of apo and CCL15 M -bound CCR1\u2013G i complexes. The models were docked into the cryo-EM density map using chimera. After the initial docked models were refined using Rosetta, the models were subjected to iterative rounds of manual adjustment and auto refinement in Coot v.0.9.4 and Phenix v.1.18, respectively. The final refinement scores were validated by the module \u2018comprehensive validation (cryo-EM)\u2019 in Phenix. The model versus map FSC was used to analysis the fitting of the refined model to the cryo-EM map. The model versus two half maps FSC curves were also compared to avoid the overfitting of model toward the map. Structure figures were prepared by PyMOL v.2.5, Chimera v.1.15 and ChiemraX v.1.2.5. Ligand bias calculated by NanoBiT assays The NanoBiT assay performed for the measurement of G protein activation was performed as previously described 46 . And for the measurement of ligand-induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, the LgBiT was inserted into the C terminal of CCR1 (1\u2013327 amino acids (aa)), and the SmBiT was N terminally fused to \u03b2-arrestin2. These sequences were then cloned into pBiT1.1 plasmids (Promega) to achieve a low-level expression in mammalian cells. These two plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells in equal proportions. After 24 h of incubation, the transfected cells were plated onto a plate (Corning), which was treated with cell adherent reagent (Applygen) in advance. After another 12 h of incubation, the transfected cells were washed once with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution buffer, and then maintained in the same buffer containing 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA and 5 \u00b5M coelenterazine h (yeasen) at a volume of 25 \u03bcl per well. After incubation for 30 min, the plate was measured for baseline luminescence (Spark Multimode microplate reader, TECAN). Every ligand (5 \u03bcl) was added at different concentrations from (10 \u22126 to 10 \u221213 M) before second measurement. Luminescence counts were normalized to the initial count. Fold-change signals over the lowest concentration treatment of corresponding ligand were calculated. Finally, data were normalized to 100% of the maximal CCL15 (27\u201392) response for wild-type CCR1 using a sigmoidal dose response in GraphPad Prism. The bias factors (\u03b2 value) were determined by applying the following equation: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\beta \\,{{{\\mathrm{value}}}} = {{{\\mathrm{log}}}}\\left( {\\left[ {\\frac{{E_{{\\mathrm{max}},P1}}}{{{\\mathrm{EC}}_{50,P1}}}\\frac{{{\\mathrm{EC}}_{50,P2}}}{{{{E}}_{{\\mathrm{max}},P2}}}} \\right]_{{\\mathrm{ligand}}} \\times \\left[ {\\frac{{{{E}}_{{\\mathrm{max}},P2}}}{{{\\mathrm{EC}}_{50,P2}}}\\frac{{{\\mathrm{EC}}_{50,P1}}}{{{{E}}_{{\\mathrm{max}},P1}}}} \\right]_{{\\mathrm{reference}}}} \\right)$$\\end{document} \u03b2 value = log E max , P 1 EC 50 , P 1 EC 50 , P 2 E max , P 2 ligand \u00d7 E max , P 2 EC 50 , P 2 EC 50 , P 1 E max , P 1 reference where P 1 is NanoBiT G i protein dissociation; P 2, NanoBiT \u03b2-arrestin recruitments; a \u03b2 value >0 denotes G i -protein biased and a \u03b2 value <0 is \u03b2-arrestin biased. Parameters used in this equation were based on the curve fits of the combined datasets described above. Molecular dynamics simulations CCL15 L -bound, CCL15 M -bound and apo state of CCR1 models were substrate from the CCL15 L \u2013CCR1\u2013G i , CCL15 M \u2013CCR1\u2013G i and apo CCR1\u2013G i complexes, respectively. The orientations of receptors are calculated by the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes database. Following that, the whole systems were prepared by the CHARM-GUI and embedded in a bilayer consisting of 200 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids by replacement methods. The membrane systems were then solvated into a periodic TIP3P water box supplemented with 0.15 M NaCl. The CHARMM36m Force Field was used to model protein molecules. Then these systems were subjected to minimization for 10,000 steps using the conjugated gradient algorithm, and then heated and equilibrated at 310.13 K and 1 atm for 200 ps with 10.0 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 harmonic restraints in the NAMD v.2.13. Then there were five cycles of equilibration for 2 ns each at 310.13 K and 1 atm, at which the harmonic restraints were 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 in sequence. Production simulations were run at 310.13 K and 1 atm in the NPT ensemble using the Langevin thermostat and Nose\u2013Hoover method for 250 ns. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method with a cutoff of 12 \u00c5. Throughout the final stages of equilibration and production, 5.0 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 harmonic restraints were placed on the residues of two state CCR1 models that were within 5 \u00c5 of ligand CCL15 include the five key residues (T86 2.56 , W90 2.60 , Y113 3.32 , Y255 6.51 , Y291 7.43 ) related to biased signaling. Trajectories were visualized and analyzed using VMD v.1.9.3. The representative r.m.s.d. analysis presented in Extended Data Fig. 1a was performed by Origin2018, and statistical analysis of Extended Data Fig. 1b was performed by GraphPad Prism v.7. Flow cytometric analysis of the receptor expression Flow cytometric analyses were performed by using CytoFlex (Beckman CytoFlex). The transfected cells were stained with PE anti-flag (Biolegend). Cells were gated by FSC-A versus SSC-A to exclude debris and then by FSC-H versus FSC-W to exclude cell doublets. Single cell APC fluorescence intensities were determined from over 3000 cells per experiment, which reflected the membrane protein expression level. All data of mutated CCR1 were normalized to the expression level of wild-type receptor in the same experiment. Values were shown as a percentage of the wild-type, which was set to 100%.
