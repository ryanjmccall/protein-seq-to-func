    "abstract_text": "We present a method to enrich for glycoproteins from proteomic samples. Sialylated glycoproteins were selectively periodate-oxidized, captured on hydrazide beads, trypsinized and released by acid hydrolysis of sialic acid glycosidic bonds. Mass spectrometric fragment analysis allowed identification of glycan structures, and additional fragmentation of deglycosylated ions yielded peptide sequence information, which allowed glycan attachment site and protein identification. We identified 36 N-linked and 44 O-linked glycosylation sites on glycoproteins from human cerebrospinal fluid.",
