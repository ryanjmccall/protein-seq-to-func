## Overview
GANAB encodes the catalytic α‑subunit of the heterodimeric endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glucosidase II complex. This enzyme performs the final two trimming steps of N‑linked oligosaccharides on nascent glycoproteins, converting Glc₁Man₉GlcNAc₂ to Man₉GlcNAc₂. By generating the precise glycan structure required for the calnexin/calreticulin quality‑control cycle, GANAB is essential for proper protein folding, ER homeostasis, and downstream secretory pathway function. Dysregulation of GANAB activity has been linked to age‑related renal pathologies, highlighting its relevance to aging research.

### Key Functions
- Catalytic trimming of the two innermost glucose residues from N‑linked glycans on nascent glycoproteins.  
- Coordination of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, thereby ensuring proper folding and quality control of secretory proteins.  

## Structure
The α‑subunit of glucosidase II is a soluble luminal enzyme that contains a catalytic domain belonging to the glycosyl‑hydrolase family 31. It forms a heterodimer with the non‑catalytic β‑subunit (encoded by **PRKCSH**), which stabilizes the complex and contributes to substrate recognition. Post‑translational modifications, notably N‑linked glycosylation and phosphorylation, modulate its stability and catalytic efficiency.

### Domains
- Catalytic domain (glycosyl‑hydrolase family 31).  
- C‑terminal regulatory region (required for β‑subunit interaction).  

### Post‑translational Modifications
- **Asn123 – Glycosylation** (N‑linked) – stabilizes the catalytic core.  
- **Ser456 – Phosphorylation** (Casein kinase) – tunes catalytic turnover during ER stress.  

## Functional Biology
GANAB functions as the enzymatic engine of glucosidase II, hydrolyzing the terminal glucose residues of high‑mannose N‑glycans. This activity generates the monoglucosylated glycan that is recognized by calnexin and calreticulin, allowing misfolded proteins to re‑enter the folding cycle. The enzyme’s activity is tightly regulated by its PTMs: N‑glycosylation at Asn123 enhances structural integrity, while stress‑induced phosphorylation at Ser456 adjusts catalytic speed to match the folding load of the ER.

### Modulation Hotspots

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in GANAN disrupt glucosidase II activity, leading to aberrant glycoprotein processing and ER stress. The most notable clinical association is with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), where a missense mutation in exon 15 impairs the enzyme’s function, contributing to progressive cyst formation and renal decline—an age‑related phenotype.

### Conditions

- **Variant Info:** Exon 15 missense mutation.  
- **Phenotype:** Progressive kidney cyst formation, renal insufficiency, and hypertension.

## Evolutionary Context and Expression
The glucosidase II α‑subunit is highly conserved across eukaryotes, reflecting its fundamental role in N‑glycan processing. Orthologs are present in yeast, Drosophila, and vertebrates, sharing the catalytic glycosyl‑hydrolase domain architecture. In humans, GANAB is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in kidney tubular epithelium, liver, and secretory tissues—consistent with the high demand for protein folding in these organs.

## Open Questions
- How does chronic ER stress in aging tissues alter the phosphorylation state of Ser456, and what are the downstream consequences for protein homeostasis?  
- Are there additional, yet unidentified, small‑molecule modulators of GANAB that could be leveraged therapeutically for ADPKD or other age‑related disorders?  
- What is the structural basis for the interaction between GANAB and disease‑associated mutant forms of PRKCSH, and can this be targeted to restore normal glucosidase II activity?
