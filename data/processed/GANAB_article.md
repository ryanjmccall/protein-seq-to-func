## Overview
GANAB encodes the catalytic α‑subunit of glucosidase II, an essential endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident enzyme that trims the two innermost glucose residues from N‑linked oligosaccharides on nascent glycoproteins. This trimming is a prerequisite for proper interaction with the calnexin/calreticulin quality‑control cycle, thereby influencing protein folding, ER homeostasis, and downstream cellular stress responses. Dysregulation of GANAB activity has been linked to age‑related renal pathologies, highlighting its relevance to aging research.

### Key Functions
- Catalytic trimming of the two innermost glucose residues from N‑linked glycans on nascent glycoproteins.  
- Coordination of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle to ensure proper protein folding and ER quality control.  

## Structure
The α‑subunit of glucosidase II contains a catalytic domain responsible for glucose hydrolysis and a luminal region that interacts with the β‑subunit (PRKCSH). While no high‑resolution PDB structure is currently available for the human protein, the enzyme is known to be a type II membrane protein with a short N‑terminal cytosolic tail, a single transmembrane helix, and a large C‑terminal lumenal catalytic region.

### Domains

## Functional Biology
Glucosidase II functions as a heterodimer composed of the catalytic α‑subunit (GANAB) and the non‑catalytic β‑subunit (PRKCSH). The enzyme removes glucose residues sequentially, generating a monoglucosylated glycan that is recognized by calnexin/calreticulin. This interaction retains the glycoprotein in the ER for proper folding; once correctly folded, the final glucose is removed, allowing the protein to exit the ER. The activity of GANAB is modulated by PTMs that fine‑tune its catalytic efficiency and stability under stress conditions.

### Modulation Hotspots
#### Asn123 Glycosylation
- **Description:** N‑linked glycan addition stabilizes luminal folding intermediates.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes the catalytic core and enhances enzyme stability within the ER lumen.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in GANANB have been implicated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a progressive disorder characterized by the formation of numerous renal cysts that compromise kidney function. The identified exon 15 missense mutation likely perturbs glucosidase II activity, leading to defective glycoprotein processing and downstream cystogenesis, a phenotype that worsens with age.

### Conditions

- **Variant Info:** Exon 15 missense mutation.  
- **Phenotype:** Progressive kidney cyst formation, renal enlargement, and eventual loss of renal function.

## Evolutionary Context and Expression
Glucosidase II α‑subunit is highly conserved across eukaryotes, reflecting its fundamental role in N‑glycan processing. Orthologs are present in yeast, Drosophila, and vertebrates, sharing key catalytic residues. In humans, GANAB is ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in secretory tissues such as the pancreas, liver, and kidney—organs with intensive protein synthesis and folding demands.

## Open Questions
- How does the Ser456 phosphorylation state change during normal aging versus pathological ER stress?  
- What is the structural basis for the interaction between GANAB and specific small‑molecule inhibitors like DNJ?  
- Can modulation of GANAB activity ameliorate cyst formation in ADPKD models, offering a therapeutic avenue?  
- Are there additional, yet unidentified, PTMs that regulate GANAB function in age‑related diseases?
