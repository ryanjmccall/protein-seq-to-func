  "abstract_text": "We have characterized the human DNA excision repair gene, XPAC (xeroderma pigmentosum group A complementing). This gene of approximately 25 kb consists of six exons. The 5'-flanking region of the gene has a CAAT box, but no TATA box. The region upstream from the coding sequence of exon 1 is G + C rich (73%), and has a GC box. Transcriptional mapping analysis suggested that there is one major transcription start point (tsp). The presence of two polyadenylation signals suggests that the two XPAC mRNAs with different 3' untranslated regions in normal human cells are due to alternative polyadenylations. The promoter activity, measured by transient expression of the cat gene with the 5' flanking regions, indicated the presence of a functional promoter.",
