    "abstract_text": "Protein kinase C (PKC) delta plays an important role in cellular proliferation and apoptosis where it is involved in the caspase-3 mediated apoptotic pathway. Cleavage of PKCdeltaI by caspase-3 releases a catalytically active C-terminal fragment that is sufficient to induce apoptosis. In this paper, we identified a novel human PKCdelta isozyme, PKCdeltaVIII (Genbank accession number DQ516383) in human teratocarcinoma (NT2) cells that differentiate into hNT neurons upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Expression of PKCdeltaVIII was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis, and we observed that after an initial peak at 24 h following RA treatment, its expression gradually declined with prolonged RA treatment. PKCdeltaVIII is generated via the utilization of an alternative 5' splice site, and this results in an insertion of 31 amino acids in the caspase-3 recognition sequence DMQD. The function of PKCdeltaVIII was examined by subcloning it into an expression vector and raising an antibody specific to PKCdeltaVIII. Using in vivo and in vitro assays, we demonstrated that PKCdeltaVIII is resistant to caspase-3 cleavage. Next, we sought to determine the role of PKCdeltaVIII in apoptosis in NT2 cells. Overexpression of PKCdeltaVIII and knockdown using PKCdeltaVIII siRNA suggest an antiapoptotic function for the PKCdeltaVIII isozyme. We demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) directed toward the 5' splice site I promote the expression of the PKCdeltaVIII isozyme. Our results indicated that ASO mediated PKCdeltaVIII expression rescued NT2 cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis. We conclude that the novel human PKCdeltaVIII splice variant functions as an antiapoptotic protein in NT2 cells.",
