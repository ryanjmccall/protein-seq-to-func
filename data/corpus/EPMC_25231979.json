    "abstract_text": "The components of the cellular protein translation machinery, such as ribosomal proteins and translation factors, are subject to numerous post-translational modifications. In particular, this group of proteins is frequently methylated. However, for the majority of these methylations, the responsible methyltransferases (MTases) remain unknown. The human FAM86A (family with sequence similarity 86) protein belongs to a recently identified family of protein MTases, and we here show that FAM86A catalyzes the trimethylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) on Lys-525. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTase Yjr129c, which displays sequence homology to FAM86A, is a functional FAM86A orthologue, modifying the corresponding residue (Lys-509) in yeast eEF2, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, Yjr129c-deficient yeast cells displayed phenotypes related to eEF2 function (i.e. increased frameshifting during protein translation and hypersensitivity toward the eEF2-specific drug sordarin). In summary, the present study establishes the function of the previously uncharacterized MTases FAM86A and Yjr129c, demonstrating that these enzymes introduce a functionally important lysine methylation in eEF2. Based on the previous naming of similar enzymes, we have redubbed FAM86A and Yjr129c as eEF2-KMT and Efm3, respectively.",
