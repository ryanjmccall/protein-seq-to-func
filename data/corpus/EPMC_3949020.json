    "abstract_text": "The complete amino acid sequence of human plasma apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) isolated from normal subjects is described. ApoC-III is a linear polypeptide chain of 79 amino acids. Tryptic digestion of intact apoC-III produced 5 major peptides, while tryptic digestion of the citraconylated protein yielded two peptides. The complete amino acid sequence of apoC-III was determined by the automated Edman degradation of the intact protein as well as the various tryptic peptides. Phenylthiohydantoin amino acids were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography and chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence of apoC-III isolated from normolipidemic subjects is identical to the apoC-III sequence derived from the cDNA sequence and differs at 4 positions from the previously reported sequence of apoC-III derived from a patient with type V hyperlipoproteinemia.",
