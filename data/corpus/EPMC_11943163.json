  "abstract_text": "We report here that aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-42 promotes tau aggregation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. When Abeta-mediated aggregated tau was used as a substrate for tau protein kinase II (TPK II), an 8-fold increase in the rate of TPK II-mediated tau phosphorylation was observed. The extent of TPK II-dependent tau phosphorylation increased as a function of time and Abeta 1-42 concentration, and hyperphosphorylated tau was found to be decorated with an Alzheimer's disease-related phosphoepitope (P-Thr-231). In HEK 293 cells co-expressing CT-100 amyloid precursor protein and tau, the release of Abeta 1-42 from these cells was impaired. Taken together, these in vitro results suggest that Abeta 1-42 promotes both tau aggregation and hyperphosphorylation.",
