  "year": 2011,

  "abstract_text": "Cell cycle progression is controlled by both extracellular and intracellular signalling molecules. It has been generally believed that cdc2/CDK1 only control G(2)-M transition in mammalian and many other higher eukaryotic cells. Accumulating evidence shows that cdc2 not only promotes G(2)-M transition but is also capable of regulating G(1) progress and G(1)-S transition via association with multiple interphase cyclins; cdc2 activity can be inhibited by p21 and p27, two traditional G(1) CDK inhibitors. In addition, cdc2-cyclin B controls pronuclear union in interphase fertilized eggs. These data suggest that cdc2 may be a pluripotent CDK. Although mechanisms responsible for the multiple functions of cdc2 remain to be further investigated, interactions of cdc2 with pRb and with several important transcription factors may provide a clue to the pluripotent role of cdc2.",
