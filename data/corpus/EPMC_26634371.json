    "abstract_text": "Overexpression of the oncoprotein mortalin in cancer cells and its protein partners enables mortalin to promote multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and effectively antagonize chemotherapy-induced cell death. A UBX-domain-containing protein, UBXN2A, acts as a potential mortalin inhibitor. This current study determines whether UBXN2A effectively binds to and occupies mortalin's binding pocket, resulting in a direct improvement in the tumor's sensitivity to chemotherapy. Molecular modeling of human mortalin's binding pocket and its binding to the SEP domain of UBXN2A followed by yeast two-hybrid and His-tag pull-down assays revealed that three amino acids (PRO442, ILE558, and LYS555) within the substrate-binding domain of mortalin are crucial for UBXN2A binding to mortalin. As revealed by chase experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, overexpression of UBXN2A seems to interfere with the mortalin-CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase and consequently suppresses the C-terminus of the HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP)-mediated destabilization of p53, resulting in its stabilization in the cytoplasm and upregulation in the nucleus. Overexpression of UBXN2A causes a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and the migration of colon cancer cells. We silenced UBXN2A in the human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line, an enriched mortalin cancer cell, followed by a clinical dosage of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The UBXN2A knockout U2OS cells revealed that UBXNA is essential for the cytotoxic effect achieved by 5-FU. UBXN2A overexpression markedly increased the apoptotic response of U2OS cells to the 5-FU. In addition, silencing of UBXN2A protein suppresses apoptosis enhanced by UBXN2A overexpression in U2OS. The knowledge gained from this study provides insights into the mechanistic role of UBXN2A as a potent mortalin inhibitor and as a potential chemotherapy sensitizer for clinical application.",
