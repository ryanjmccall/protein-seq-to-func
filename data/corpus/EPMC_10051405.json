    "abstract_text": "Reversible acetylation of histone proteins plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and developmental events. The steady state of histone acetylation is controlled by the enzymatic activities of multiple histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Three distinct human HDACs are homologous to RPD3, a yeast transcriptional regulator. We have isolated and sequenced a genomic clone for the human HDAC3 gene. This is a single-copy gene spanning a region of at least 13 kb. Determination of the intron-exon splice junctions established that the gene is encoded by 15 exons ranging in size from 56 to 657 bp. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies localized this gene to 5q31. Double-target experiments in which both HDAC3 and the early-growth response 1 gene (EGR1), which is localized in the 5q31.2 region, were used as probes showed that the HDAC3 gene lies in region 5q31.3, immediately distal to EGR1 with respect to the centromere.",
