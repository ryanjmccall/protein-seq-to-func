    "abstract_text": "We have identified two novel alternatively spliced forms of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase by expression screening of a human skeletal muscle library with phosphorylated baculovirus- produced human insulin receptor substrate 1. One form is identical to p85alpha throughout the region which encodes both Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and the inter-SH2 domain/p110 binding region but diverges in sequence from p85alpha on the 5' side of nucleotide 953, where the entire break point cluster gene and SH3 regions are replaced by a unique 34-amino-acid N terminus. This form has an estimated molecular mass of approximately 53 kDa and has been termed p85/AS53. The second form is identical to p85 and p85/AS53 except for a 24-nucleotide insert between the SH2 domains that results in a replacement of aspartic acid 605 with nine amino acids, adding two potential serine phosphorylation sites in the vicinity of the known serine autophosphorylation site (Ser-608). Northern (RNA) analyses reveal a wide tissue distribution of p85alpha, whereas p85/AS53 is dominant in skeletal muscle and brain, and the insert isoforms are restricted to cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle. Western blot (immunoblot) analyses using an anti-p85 polyclonal antibody and a specific anti-p85/AS53 antibody confirmed the tissue distribution of p85/AS53 protein and indicate a approximately 7-fold higher expression of p85/AS53 protein than of p85 in skeletal muscle. Both p85 and p85/AS53 bind to p110 in coprecipitation experiments, but p85alpha itself appears to have preferential binding to insulin receptor substrate 1 following insulin stimulation. These data indicate that the gene for the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase can undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing. Two novel splice variants of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase are present in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain; these variants may have important functional differences in activity and may play a role in tissue-specific signals such as insulin-stimulated glucose transport or control of neurotransmitter secretion or action.",
