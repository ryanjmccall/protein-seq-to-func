    "abstract_text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is most prevalent arthropod-borne human pathogen belongs to Flaviviridae family causes thousands of deaths annually. HMGB1 is highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed, non-histone nuclear protein which plays important role in diseases like metabolic disorders, cancer, and viral infections. However, the importance of HMGB1 in DENV infection is understudied. In this study, we observed that DENV-2 induces cytoplasmic translocation and secretion of HMGB1. Interestingly, inhibition of HMGB1 secretion by ethyl pyruvate (EP) enhanced viral propagation while silencing of HMGB1 resulted in abrogated viral replication in DENV-2 infected A549 cells. RNA-Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunoprecipitation showed that HMGB1 interacts with 5'-3' UTRs of DENV-2 genome. This interaction further stimulates production of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 which have been implicated in pathogenesis of severe DENV disease. Together, our finding suggests that DENV-2 modulates HMGB1 translocation and HMGB1-DENV-2 UTRs RNA interaction further induces proinflammatory cytokines production in A549 cells. This study discloses HMGB1 as an important host factor contributing to disease pathogenesis and hence can be targeted as an alternative approach for antiviral development against DENV virus infection.",
