  "abstract_text": "Physical forces can activate colon cancer cell adhesion, critical for metastasis. Paxillin is phosphorylated by FAK and required for pressure-stimulated adhesion. However, whether paxillin acts as an inert scaffolding protein or whether paxillin phosphorylation is required is unknown. Transfection with paxillin point-phosphorylation mutants demonstrated that phosphorylation at tyrosines 31 and 118 together is necessary for pressure-stimulated adhesion. We further evaluated potential paxillin partners. Reducing the adaptor protein Crk or the focal adhesion protein p130Cas blocked pressure-stimulated adhesion. Furthermore, Crk and p130Cas both displayed increased co-immunoprecipitation with paxillin in response to increased pressure, except in cells transfected with a Y31Y118 paxillin mutant. Inhibiting the small GTPase Rac1 also abolished pressure-stimulated adhesion, and reducing paxillin by siRNA blocked Rac1 phosphorylation by pressure. Thus, paxillin phosphorylation at tyrosines 31 and 118 together is necessary for pressure-induced adhesion. Paxillin, Crk and Cas form a trimeric complex that activates Rac1 and mediates this effect.",
