  "abstract_text": "In this study, analysis of structural changes of the p53 gene in colorectal tumors revealed point mutations detected in 8 of 14 carcinomas and 2 of 2 adenomas. Of these 10 cases with point mutations, eight had one or more missense mutations, one had a nonsense mutation, and the remaining one had, interestingly, an intronic point mutation with subsequent activation of a cryptic splice donor site in the flanking exon. This report contains the first identification of an intronic point mutation of the p53 gene in a colorectal cancer case.",
