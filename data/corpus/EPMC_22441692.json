    "abstract_text": "The posttranslational regulation of mammalian clock proteins has been assigned a time-keeping function, but seems to have more essential roles. Here we show that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), identified by inhibitor screening of BMAL1 phosphorylation at Ser 520/Thr 527/Ser 592, confers dynamic regulation on the clock. Knockdown of JNK1 and JNK2 abrogates BMAL1 phosphorylation and lengthens circadian period in fibroblasts. Mice deficient for neuron-specific isoform JNK3 have altered behavioural rhythms, with longer free-running period and compromised phase shifts to light. The locomotor rhythms are insensitive to intensity variance of constant light, deviating from Aschoff's rule. Thus, JNK regulates a core characteristic of the circadian clock by controlling the oscillation speed and the phase in response to light.",
