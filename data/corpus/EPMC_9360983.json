    "abstract_text": "Integrin-ligand binding induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins including focal adhesion kinase (pp125(FAK)) and Crk-associated substrate (Cas). FAK is activated and autophosphorylated by the ligation of integrins, although the substrate of FAK has not been revealed. We show here that p130(Cas) and Cas-L are FAK substrates. FAK directly phosphorylates Cas proteins primarily at the YDYVHL sequence that is conserved among all Cas proteins. Furthermore, the phosphorylated YDYVHL sequence is a binding site for Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, and the recruited Src family kinase phosphorylates the other tyrosine residues within Cas. The Cas-L YDYVHL sequence is phosphorylated upon integrin-ligand binding, and this integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited by the cotransfection of the FAK COOH-terminal domain that does not contain a kinase domain. These findings strongly suggest that FAK initiates integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas proteins; then, Src family tyrosine kinases, which are recruited to phosphorylated Cas and FAK, further phosphorylate Cas proteins.",
