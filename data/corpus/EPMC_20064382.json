    "abstract_text": "The rapidly adapting (RA) low-threshold mechanoreceptors respond to movement of the skin and vibration and are critical for the perception of texture and shape. In this issue of Neuron, two papers (Bourane et al. and Luo et al.) demonstrate that early-born Ret+ sensory neurons are RA mechanoreceptors, whose peripheral nerve terminals are associated with Meissner corpuscles, longitudinal lanceolate endings, and Pacinian corpuscles. The studies further show that Ret signaling is essential for the development of these mechanoreceptors.",
