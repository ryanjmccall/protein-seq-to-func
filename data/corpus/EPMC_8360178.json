    "abstract_text": "H2TF1 is a ubiquitous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-specific transcription factor, which binds to the palindromic kappa B enhancer site upstream of MHC class I genes. Here we report that H2TF1 consists of a polypeptide with relative molecular mass 110,000, that corresponds to the predicted 100-kDa product (NF-kappa B2 p100) encoded by the candidate proto-oncogene nfkb2 (lyt-10). H2TF1 was purified by a novel affinity chromatography method and identified as the NF-kappa B2 p100 polypeptide by peptide sequencing as well as by reactivity with a specific antiserum. Purified H2TF1 binds the MHC kappa B site with high affinity (KD = 3 x 10(-11) M), in contrast with previous reports that NF-kappa B2 p100 did not bind DNA.",
