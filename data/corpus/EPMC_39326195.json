Keywords Acanthamoeba castellanii Redox system Thioredoxin reductase Selenoprotein Auranofin Thioredoxin reductase inhibitor 1 Introduction Acanthamoeba species are cosmopolitan free-living amoebas found in water, soil and air environments ( Siddiqui and Khan, 2012 ). The amoebas of this genus are opportunistic pathogens which can cause Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a sight-threatening corneal inflammation, which affects mostly healthy individuals wearing contact lenses, and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), a fatal infection of the central nervous system, occurring mostly in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, they can cause disseminated infections, affecting the skin, sinuses, lungs and other organs, also commonly observed in immunocompromised individuals ( Marciano-Cabral and Cabral, 2003 ). AK is more common than the two other infections and represents 2% of corneal infections worldwide ( List et al., 2021 ) and its prevalence is increasing ( Lorenzo-Morales et al., 2015 ; Nielsen et al., 2020 ; Randag et al., 2019 ). This is due to the continual increase in the use of contact lenses, associated with inadequate contact lens care and hygiene ( Maycock and Jayaswal, 2016 ). Treatment for AK lacks international standardization and national guidelines, as well as specific drugs against these amoebas. The current standard regime relies on broad-spectrum antiseptics, such as chlorhexidine (CLX) or polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), often in combination with propamidine isethionate ( Randag et al., 2019 ). Moreover, AK therapy can be challenging due to Acanthamoeba 's highly resistant cyst stage, which frequently necessitates prolonged, aggressive, and demanding treatment with severe side effects. In addition, recurrence of AK is possible when the treatment fails to eradicate the cysts ( Dart et al., 2009 ). Despite advancements in the past years ( Roberts and Henriquez, 2010 ), there is a need for the development of drugs that combat the cysts or inhibit encystment. Principally, as Acanthamoeba infections are very rare, only limited resources have been devoted to understanding the parasite's biology and to the development of new treatments ( Angelici et al., 2021 ). Consequently, many details of Acanthamoeba 's cell biology and metabolism remain unknown. Data from more extensively studied protozoan parasites have revealed enzymes in redox networks as promising drug targets due to their crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis ( Fata et al., 2022 ; Kuntz et al., 2007 ; Pal and Bandyopadhyay, 2012 ). Targeting these enzymes offers a feasible avenue for developing novel antiparasitic drugs. Examples include benznidazole and nifurtimox inhibiting trypanothione reductase (TryR) in trypanosomes ( De Rycker et al., 2023 ; Kourbeli et al., 2021 ), responsible for diseases like sleeping sickness and Chagas disease, as well as artemisinin derivatives increasing ROS levels and inhibiting glutathione reductase (GR) in Plasmodium falciparum , the etiologic agent of malaria tropica ( Egwu et al., 2021 , 2022 ). Parasite selenoprotein thioredoxin reductases may be particularly suitable drug targets ( Gencheva et al., 2022 ). Acanthamoeba belongs to the Amoebozoa and thus is phylogenetically more closely related to humans than most other protozoan pathogens ( Roberts and Henriquez, 2010 ). This raises concerns about potential side effects or toxicity of new drugs designed to treat Acanthamoeba infections in humans. Conversely, these similar molecular pathways might facilitate repurposing medications initially designed for human cancer treatment. Structure-drug design is a potentially useful approach to repurposing these drugs ( Ondarza, 2007 ). It compares the three-dimensional structures of target enzyme active sites in the parasite and the host. Through this technique, compounds that specifically bind to the parasites\u2019 enzymes can potentially be designed ( Klebe, 2000 ). For these reasons, a recent study by Leitsch et al. (2021) investigated the thioredoxin and glutathione system in A. castellanii . This study revealed the characteristics and the roles of the respective components in the response to oxidative stress. A. castellanii expresses two types of thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs): a small form of approximately 35 kDa (AcTrxR-S) also found in bacteria, archaea, plants and other unicellular eukaryotes, and a large selenoprotein form of approximately 55 kDa (AcTrxR-L) usually found in mammals ( Leitsch et al., 2021 ). Their work focused on the recombinant expression and biochemical characterization of TrxR-S. However, in their study, Leitsch et al. (2021) attempted to express the enzyme AcTrxR-L using various expression systems, but these systems interpreted the UGA codon as a stop codon, resulting in a truncated, non-functional enzyme. Consequently, they hypothesized that it was a selenoprotein; however, they could not confirm this since intricate synthesis machineries are responsible for the biosynthesis of selenoproteins, the recombinant expression of TrxR-L was not achieved and thus, its role not unraveled. This finding highlighted the need for an expression system where the UGA codon could be correctly interpreted as selenocysteine and confirm it. Given the importance of cellular redox systems, their potential druggability in other parasites and the unknown role of TrxR-L, the aim of this study was to address if AcTrxR-L is essential to the amoeba and might represent a valid drug target. For that, the recombinant expression and biochemical characterization of AcTrxR-L as a selenoprotein was achieved following recently developed methods ( Cheng et al., 2021 ). Its susceptibility to the gold-based compound auranofin, approved by the US FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( Roder and Thomson, 2015 ), was evaluated. Two new compounds, thioredoxin reductase inhibitor \u22121 and \u22122 (TRi-1 and TRi-2), which are more specific against selenoprotein TrxR ( Sabatier et al., 2021 ), were also studied. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the respective compounds on human corneal epithelial cells was assessed. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Expression and purification of recombinant AcTrxR-L and Trx The AcTrxR-L gene (XP_004353633/ACA_1153040) was ordered from Eurofins and cloned into pABC2a expression vector, designing the protein fused with an N-terminal His- and SUMO motif ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ) using UAG together with a SECIS element for selenocysteine insertion ( Cheng et al., 2021 ). The plasmid (pABC2a-AcTrxR-L) was subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli strain C321.\u0394A for selenoprotein expression, followed by purification, tag removal and storage performed as previously described ( Cheng et al., 2021 ; Cheng and Arn\u00e9r, 2022 ). In short, elution of the target protein from a HisPrep FF 16/10 column equipped on an \u00c4KTA explorer FPLC system (Cytiva Life Sciences) was done with a mixture of 40% IMAC eluting buffer (approx. 200 mM imidazole final concentration) and 60% IMAC washing buffer. SUMO protease ULP1 was added to the fractions of the eluent with fusion protein and the mixture was carefully transferred into a pretreated dialysis tube which was sealed and dialyzed in 5 L dialyzing buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C, allowing for ULP1 digestion. The dialyzed mixture was re-applied onto the HisPrep FF 16/10 column to separate cleaved non-tagged target selenoprotein from the N-terminal His-tagged fusion partner as well as from His-tagged ULP1. AcTrxR-L in the flowthrough fractions were collected and concentrated. The purity of the final selenoprotein AcTrxR-L was greater than 95% as assessed by SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2 ) and its concentration was 13.049 mg/ml calculated by measuring the absorbance at 463 nm on a spectrophotometer and using the extinction coefficient of FAD (AcTrxR-L is a homodimer with one FAD molecule in each subunit), which is 11,300 M \u22121 cm \u22121 ( Cheng and Arn\u00e9r, 2022 ).

For further details, see the Methods description. Fig. 2 To evaluate the enzymatic activity of AcTrxR-L and assess whether, like other selenoprotein TrxR enzymes, it is able to reduce a wide range of substrates, its activities were determined with Acanthamoeba thioredoxins (Trx), and the Trxs of another free-living amoeba, namely Naegleria , which are amoeboflagellates and are not phylogenetically related to the genus Acanthamoeba ( Adl et al., 2005 ). The AcTrx1 (XP_004335509/ACA_1246790) and AcTrx2 (XP_004349558/ACA 1_322690) were cloned, expressed and purified as outlined previously ( Leitsch et al., 2021 ). Thioredoxin-encoding genes for N. gruberi (NgTrx1-XP_002680876-) and N. fowleri (NfTrx1- XM_044703242-) were ordered from Eurofins and cloned into a pET-17b expression vector to be expressed with a C-terminal 6 x His tag in E. coli BL21-AI\u2122 cells (Thermo Fisher). Expression was performed at 37 \u00b0C with vivid shaking for 3 h. After expression, E. coli cultures were spun down and lysed by grinding in a cold (\u221220 \u00b0C) mortar with a pestle. After removal of cell debris (20,000\u00d7 g , 10 min), recombinant proteins were isolated in Ni-NTA spin columns (Qiagen) via the 6 x His tag, the purified protein was eluted in Buffer NPI-500 (Elution buffer for native conditions: 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and its concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) ( Bradford, 1976 ). All recombinant Trxs were isolated the day of the enzyme kinetic assays with their purities also assessed by SDS-PAGE gel ( Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 SDS-PAGE gel to assess the Trx purity.

Fig. 3 2.2 Enzyme kinetic assays with DTNB, GSSG, thioredoxin isoforms Unless stated otherwise, all enzyme assays for AcTrxR-L were based upon well-established selenoprotein TrxR assays, as outlined earlier ( Arn\u00e9r, 2018 ). Kinetic parameters of AcTrxR-L were determined with different biochemical assays in triplicates in cuvettes as previously described ( Fata et al., 2022 ). First, the specific activity of AcTrxR-L was calculated from its NADPH-dependent DTNB reduction. The reaction mixture contained 10 nM AcTrxR-L, 250 \u03bcM NADPH, and 2.5 mM DTNB in TE buffer (50 mM Tris and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), and the reduction of DTNB was monitored by measuring the formation of the TNB \u2212 anion at A412 nm on a spectrophotometer. Each DTNB is reduced into 2 molecules of TNB \u2212 with extinction coefficient of 13,600 M \u22121 cm \u22121 at 412 nm and the specific activity of the enzyme was calculated as Unit per mg (U/mg), with 1 U (\u03bcmol/min) defined as conversion of 1 \u03bcmol of DTNB substrate per minute. Trx-coupled reduction of GSSG was measured in a reaction containing 50 nM AcTrxR-L, with or without 10 \u03bcM AcTrx1, in the presence of 1\u20135 mM GSSG and 250 \u03bcM NADPH, following NADPH consumption at A340 nm. The G lutat h i o ne as s ubstrate of t hioredoxin (GHOST) assay ( Gromer et al., 2002 ) was used to test if the AcTrxR-L together with Trx variants would be able to indirectly reduce GSSG. The GHOST assay was carried out by measuring NADPH consumption using 50 nM AcTrxR-L, 250 \u03bcM NADPH, 2 mM GSSG and 0.1 \u03bcM\u201310 \u03bcM AcTrx1, AcTrx2, NgTrx1 or NfTrx1, and following A340. Experiments were performed in triplicates in cuvettes and enzyme velocity calculated based on a standard curve for NADPH ( Gromer et al., 2002 ). The activity of Acanthamoeba with different thioredoxin variants was assessed by measuring NADPH consumption linked to insulin reduction using 50 nM AcTrxR-L, 160 \u03bcM insulin, 250 \u03bcM NADPH and 1 \u03bcM\u201310 \u03bcM Trx variants (as indicated) following A340, the enzyme velocity calculated based on a standard curve for NADPH. Apparent Michaelis-Menten parameters were in all cases calculated based on the nonlinear fit of the velocity vs substrate concentration curves to the Michaelis-Menten equation by using GraphPad Prism. 2.3 Inhibition of AcTrxR-L The FDA-approved gold-based compound auranofin (Ridaura\u00ae), which inhibits the two mammalian selenoproteins TrxR and GPX1 ( Sabatier et al., 2021 ; Cheff et al., 2023 ) and two new compounds that more specifically target the selenoprotein TrxR, known as thioredoxin reductase inhibitor \u22121 and \u22122 (TRi-1 and TRi-2) ( Sabatier et al., 2021 ), were used to assess the inhibition of AcTrxR-L considering that other parasites selenoprotein TrxR enzymes, to this extent, can be inhibited by these compounds ( Fata et al., 2022 ; Gencheva et al., 2022 ). The reaction consisted of incubating 50 nM AcTrxR-L with 0.5\u201310 \u03bcM of auranofin, TRi-1 or TRi- 2, or 1% v/v DMSO, 250 \u03bcM NADPH and 0.01 mg/ml BSA in TE buffer for 30 min ( Fata et al., 2022 ). Then, the reaction was diluted 5-fold and 200 \u03bcl was desalted using Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Columns and Plates, 40K MWCO (Thermo Scientific, 87767), whereupon 100 \u03bcl of the reactions, either desalted or not desalted, were transferred to each well of a 96 well plate. Subsequently, 250 \u03bcM NADPH and 1 mM DTNB were added to each well. The TNB \u2212 formation at A412 nm was followed by a spectrophotometer and experiments were carried out in duplicates. The IC 50 values were determined based on the nonlinear regression (curve fit), dose-response-inhibitor equation, log (inhibitor) vs. normalized response (variable slope) using GraphPad Prism. 2.4 Acanthamoeba growth conditions Acanthamoeba castellanii strain Neff (ATCC\u00ae 30010\u2122) genotype T4 was used for all experiments. The amoebae were grown in peptone yeast extract-glucose medium (PYG) in 75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks at 25 \u00b0C with weekly medium changes as described previously ( K\u00f6hsler et al., 2022 ). 2.5 In vitro amoebicide assays The effects of auranofin, TRi-1 and TRi-2 were evaluated with the Acanthamoeba Neff strain. The amoebicidal activity was assessed by direct counting, using trypan blue ( Mart\u00edn-P\u00e9rez et al., 2021 ) and assayed in sterile 96-well microplates. Diverse drug concentrations (0\u201320 \u03bcM) were prepared via serial dilutions in DMSO, keeping total DMSO at 5% in the control well and in the drug solution wells ranging 5\u20133%. Amoebae from log-phase cultures (5 \u00d7 10 4 trophozoites/well) were inoculated into the microplates and the trophozoites were resuspended in PYG medium. Drug assays contained 100 \u03bcL of trophozoites solution, 90 \u03bcL of PYG media and 10 \u03bcL of the drug solution per well. The growth control (positive control) included 100 \u03bcL of trophozoites solution, 90 \u03bcL of PYG medium and 10 \u03bcL of DMSO. Each drug concentration and control were investigated in triplicates and each experiment was repeated in two independent setups. The plates were incubated at 25 \u00b0C during 4, 24, 48 and 72 h. Samples were placed in a B\u00fcrker-T\u00fcrk counting chamber. The IC 50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism, as explained previously. 2.6 Cytotoxicity test on human corneal epithelial cells Cytotoxicity of the compounds towards human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) (Innoprot, ref. P10871) was determined ( Loufouma Mbouaka et al., 2023 ) in 96-well microplates. The HCECs (1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well) were grown in 100 \u03bcL of corneal epithelial cell medium (CEpiCM) (Innoprot, ref. P60131) supplemented with 1% of corneal epithelial cell growth supplement (CEpiCGS), 2% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic mix: 10,000 U penicillin, 10 mg streptomycin and 25 \u03bcg amphotericin B per milliliter. After overnight incubation, cytotoxicity was evaluated adding 20 \u03bcL of CellTiter 96\u00ae AQ ueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After 1 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the absorbance at 490 nm was read using a spectrophotometer (Tecan, Spark 10M, Switzerland). It was considered that viability values between 100 and 90% were non-toxic, 90\u201375% low toxicity, 75\u201360% moderate toxicity, and lower than 60% was considered high toxicity, as previously suggested ( Lorenzo-Morales et al., 2010 ). The TD 50 values were calculated using the same method as the IC 50 values with GraphPad Prism. Moreover, the therapeutic index was determined as the ratio of TD 50 to IC 50 ( Muller and Milton, 2012 ). 3 Results 3.1 Enzyme kinetic assays with DTNB, GSSG, thioredoxin isoforms The specific activity of the selenoprotein AcTrxR-L was 4.25 U/mg as calculated from the TNB \u2212 formation in the regular DNTB assay ( Arn\u00e9r, 2018 ). The purified recombinant AcTrxR-L was found to exhibit substantial activity not only with DTNB ( Fig. 4 a) but also different parasite thioredoxins as coupled with GSSG reduction in the so called GHOST assay ( Gromer et al., 2002 ) ( Fig. 4 b and c), or insulin ( Fig. 4 d). Table 2 summarizes the apparent kinetic parameters of the enzyme with these substrates. Fig. 4 Enzyme activities of AcTrxR-L. a. Direct DTNB reduction assay. b.

Auranofin and TRi-1 were found to be very efficient inhibitors while TRi-2 showed less potency, as assessed with the direct DTNB reduction assay after 10 min incubation ( Fig. 5 ). After removal of auranofin, TRi-1 and TRi-2 from solution by desalting, it was observed that AcTrxR-L was still inhibited to a similar extent, suggesting that all three compounds irreversibly inhibit the enzyme (dashed lines in Fig. 5 ). These observations were corroborated by the calculated IC 50 values ( Table 3 ). The IC 50 values for auranofin and TRi-1 were identical even after the compounds were removed, confirming that these compounds irreversibly inhibit the enzyme. In contrast, the IC 50 value for TRi-2 was higher than the concentrations studied in this assay. Fig. 5 Relative enzyme activity of AcTrxR-L after 10 min of incubation with inhibitors. The resulting enzyme activity was determined in the direct DTNB reduction assay following A412. Error bars represent standard deviations of the mean. Solid lines represent the relative enzyme activity in the presence of the inhibitors and dashed lines after desalting.

To assess trophozoite viability, microscopic observations using the vital dye trypan blue were performed, as this method stains the dead trophozoites and confirms that the effect of the compounds are irreversible. The trophocidal activity of all compounds was found to be both, time and concentration dependent, with a decrease in viability percentage was observed with longer incubation times. However, for auranofin at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM, the viability percentages at 48 and 72 h were very similar, and the same pattern was observed for TRi-2 at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM ( Fig. 6 ). The most effective compound was TRi-1, particularly at early time points, while TRi-2 showed the highest effectiveness after 48 and 72 h ( Table 4 ).

Fig. 6 3.4 Cytotoxicity test on human corneal epithelial cells The cytotoxicity profiles of the inhibitors were next tested against human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC), revealing that auranofin showed the highest cytotoxicity while all compounds were cytotoxic at higher (>5 \u03bcM) concentrations ( Fig. 7 ). The TI was calculated ( Table 6 ), revealing that TRi-2 has the highest TI (the larger the TI, the safer the drug). However, the cytotoxicity against Acanthamoeba strain Neff trophozoites was clearly more pronounced (compare Table 4 , Table 5 ), suggesting a potential therapeutic window.

Fig. 7 4 Discussion In this study, the recombinant expression of the large selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (AcTrxR-L) of Acanthamoeba was achieved using the method developed by Cheng et al. (2021) for recombinant selenoprotein production using UAG as the Sec codon in a specific strain of E. coli (C321.\u0394A), which lacks other UAG codons and the release factor RF1 that normally terminates translation at UAG, enabling its production in E. coli at a higher yield and purity. This production of AcTrxR-L enabled evaluation of its kinetic parameters and susceptibility to inhibitors as reported herein. The selenoprotein AcTrxR-L, as discussed by Leitsch et al. (2021) , is a part of the rather peculiar thioredoxin system in Acanthamoeba , with concurrent presence of GR and two TrxRs, one with a low molecular weight akin to that observed in bacteria (TrxR-S) and another being the high molecular weight selenoprotein AcTrxR-L resembling the orthologue found in vertebrates (TrxR-L). Recent studies ( K\u00f6hsler et al., 2022 ; Leitsch et al., 2021 ) have shown that oxidative stressors enhanced the mRNA expression of GR but had no influence on protein levels. Moreover, GR showed high activity when it was measured in cell extracts. In the case of AcTrR-S, its activity could not be measured in the cell extract, but the expression levels in untreated cells were low, while in cells treated with oxidative stressors, the expression at mRNA and protein level was higher. However, AcTrxR-S showed strong activity with some substrates (AcTrx-1 XP_004335509/ACA_1246790). In these previous studies, the mRNA and protein expression levels of AcTrxR-L were low and did not change after exposure to oxidative stress. Therefore, the authors suggested that it is unlikely that AcTrxR-L is involved in antioxidative defense under normal growth conditions. Furthermore, studying AcTrxR-L enzymatic activity with various substrates was not feasible at that time, as it could not be produced ( Leitsch et al., 2021 ). In the current study, the enzymatic activity was successfully analyzed and it was shown, that while AcTrxR-L can reduce AcTrx-1 and AcTrx-2 (XP_004349558/ACA 1_322690), its affinity for these substrates is not as high as that of AcTrxR-S. In addition, it was observed that it is also able to reduce Trx from other free-living amoebas, including Naegleria fowleri and N. gruberi , although they are not phylogenetically close; the affinity shown for these Trxs (NfTrx1 - XM_044703242 and NgTrx1 - XP_002680876) was slightly lower than that for AcTrx1 and AcTrx2. Interestingly, AcTrxR-L was here shown to be able to reduce GSSG when coupled to AcTrx1, similarly to the case with the TrxRs of the filarial nematodes Brugia malayi and Onchocerca volvulus ( Fata et al., 2022 ), as well as human TrxR1 ( Gromer et al., 2002 ). This indicates that AcTrxR-L together with AcTrx1 can substitute for TrxR-S or GR functions. Given its capacity to reduce Trx from other species, it is conceivable, as other authors have hypothesized, that it plays a role in pathogenicity and is involved in the oxidative response produced by host immune system cells ( Leitsch et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, additional research is required to fully understand the role of AcTrxR-L in vivo . In recent studies, auranofin was also found to effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of AcTrxR-S, with an IC 50 of 216 nM ( Leitsch et al., 2021 ). When A. castellanii trophozoites were treated with auranofin, both of the AcTrxR-S and AcTrxR-L mRNA expression levels significantly decreased, while GR mRNA levels increased ( K\u00f6hsler et al., 2022 ; Leitsch et al., 2021 ). In addition, auranofin exhibited a strong amoebicidal effect against different strains of Acanthamoeba , with an IC 50 ranging from 2.9 to 3.48 \u03bcM after 72 h of treatment ( Loufouma Mbouaka et al., 2021 ). In the current study, an efficient auranofin-mediated inhibition of AcTrxR-L was demonstrated, and using desalting also shown to be irreversible. The efficacy of auranofin against trophozoites of the Acanthamoeba Neff strain after 72 h of treatment was lower (IC 50 5.64 \u03bcM) than that reported by Loufouma Mbouaka et al. (2021) , but similar to the one observed by Feng et al. (2020) \u2013 5.79 \u03bcM. Together, these observations show that auranofin has pleiotropic effects towards the amoeba redox systems, resulting in amoebicidal efficacy. Here, the potential inhibitory effects of the novel compounds TRi-1 and TRi-2, which inhibit more specifically than auranofin selenoprotein TrxR enzymes, were also investigated. While TRi-2 did not completely suppress the enzyme activity of AcTrxR-L at any of the tested concentrations, TRi-1 demonstrated an inhibitory capacity equivalent to that of auranofin. Also the inhibitions by TRi-1 and TRi-2 were irreversible, as judged from the desalting experiments. These compounds have also been shown to inhibit the selenoprotein orthologues of Brugia malayi and Onchocerca volvulus ( Fata et al., 2022 ). TRi-1 successfully inhibited those enzymes at the same level as auranofin, and TRi-2 was less effective ( Fata et al., 2022 ). Surprisingly, when A. castellanii Neff trophozoites were treated with these compounds, TRi-2 (IC 50 2.08 \u03bcM) was more effective than the other two inhibitors and TRi-1 (IC 50 4.29 \u03bcM) reduced trophozoite viability to the same extent as auranofin. Hence, the ability of TRi-2 to kill trophozoites does not correspond to its capacity to inhibit AcTrxR-L, so it is plausible that this compound may also affect other critical molecules in the Acanthamoeba metabolism. Naturally, both uptake and intracellular metabolism can also differ between the compounds as other reasons for divergent amoebicidal profiles. Additionally, in this study, the effectiveness of the compounds was tested only in the Neff strain (since it is well-characterized and commonly used in research), but the effects of the compounds may be differ between clinical isolates. Further assays with several clinical isolates will be carried out in the future to understand the effect of the compounds, as well as, the characterization of the enzyme AcTrxR-L in the different clinical isolates. The cytotoxicity of auranofin, TRi-1 and TRi-2 was also studied in human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) showing that all of them are cytotoxic to some extent; however, in the cases of TRi-1 and TRi-2 (IC 50 8.40 and 8.08 \u03bcM, respectively), the toxicity towards Acanthamoeba trophozoites was considerably higher, indicating that less concentration would be needed to kill trophozoites than to induce damage to HCEC. Moreover, chlorhexidine, the drug of choice in AK treatment, has an IC 50 of 1.58 \u03bcM against HCEC, thus exerting even higher cytotoxicity ( Mart\u00edn-P\u00e9rez et al., 2019 ). Therefore, these compounds are valid drug candidates and should not be discarded as future amoebicidal agents, either in the treatment of AK or as a disinfectant in contact lens solutions, given their favorable therapeutic index. Research on amoeba antioxidant enzymes as potential drug targets has been intensified in the past few years ( Andrade and Reed, 2015 ; Leitsch et al., 2018 ). Most organisms have two parallel systems that regulate redox balance: one based on glutathione (GSH) and the other on isoforms of thioredoxin (Trx). These systems are essential for maintaining redox homeostasis and are involved in vital physiological processes ( Arn\u00e9r, 2022 ). In several parasites, these enzymes have been successfully inhibited and proposed as drug targets. For example, the inhibition of the trypanothione reductase in trypanosomatids has a parasiticidal effect ( Krauth-Siegel et al., 2005 ). An antiparasitic effect was also observed after silencing the thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) expression in Schistosoma mansoni , and the treatment with auranofin in infected mice reduced the worm burden by 60% ( Kuntz et al., 2007 ). In the present study, we have shown that the inhibition with auranofin, TRi-1 and TRi-2 led to the death of Acanthamoeba trophozoites. However, the unique system of Acanthamoeba with three enzymes involved in the redox regulation (AcGR, AcTrxR-S and AcTrxR-L) increases the difficulty of their use as therapeutic targets since the amoeba has several backup systems. Further studies are needed to determine how the three enzymes work in combination and to develop a strategy to inhibit them effectively to kill Acanthamoeba trophozoites. 5 Conclusions In summary, this study provides a detailed potential analysis of targeting the large thioredoxin reductase (AcTrxR-L) as a novel therapeutic strategy for Acanthamoeba infections. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of auranofin, TRi-1, and TRi-2 on AcTrxR-L activity were assessed, with auranofin exhibiting potent inhibition followed by TRi-1, indicating that the inhibition of AcTrxR-L affects the viability of Acanthamoeba trophozoites, suggesting their potential as future amoebicidal agents. Further research into its structure, function, and inhibition mechanisms is needed to fully exploit its therapeutic potential.

    "full_text_abstract": "The genus Acanthamoeba comprises facultative pathogens, causing Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). In both diseases, treatment options are limited, and drug development is challenging. This study aimed to investigate the role of the large thioredoxin reductase selenoprotein of Acanthamoeba (AcTrxR-L) as a potential drug target assessing the effects of the thioredoxin reductase inhibitors auranofin, TRi-1, and TRi-2 on AcTrxR-L activity and on the viability of Acanthamoeba trophozoites. Recombinant expression and purification of AcTrxR-L as a selenoprotein allowed assessments of its enzymatic activity, with reduction of various substrates, including different thioredoxin isoforms. Auranofin demonstrated potent inhibition towards AcTrxR-L, followed by TRi-1, and TRi-2 exhibiting lower effectiveness. The inhibitors showed variable activity against trophozoites in culture, with TRi-1 and TRi-2 resulting in strongly impaired trophozoite viability. Cytotoxicity tests with human corneal epithelial cells revealed lower susceptibility to all compounds compared to Acanthamoeba trophozoites, underscoring their potential as future amoebicidal agents. Altogether, this study highlights the druggability of AcTrxR-L and suggests it to be a promising drug target for the treatment of Acanthamoeba infections. Further research is warranted to elucidate the role of AcTrxR-L in Acanthamoeba pathogenesis and to develop effective therapeutic strategies targeting this redox enzyme.\n\nGraphical abstract Image 1\n\nHighlights \u2022 Recombinant AcTrxR-L was expressed, purfied and confirmed as a selenoprotein with enzymatic activity. \u2022 Enzyme kinetic assays showed AcTrxR-L's ability to reduce various substrates, including different thioredoxin isoforms. \u2022 Auranofin, TRi-1 and TRi-2 compounds inhibited AcTrxR-L, indicating their potential as future amoebicidal agents. \u2022 Auranofin, TRi-1 and TRi-2 impaired trophozoite viability in culture."
