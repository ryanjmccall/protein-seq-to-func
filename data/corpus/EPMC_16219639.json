    "abstract_text": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that can be activated by cytokines and growth factors. It plays important roles in cell growth, apoptosis and cell transformation, and is constitutively active in a variety of tumor cells. In this study, we provide evidence that zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) interacts physically with STAT3. ZIPK specifically interacted with STAT3, and did not bind to STAT1, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b or STAT6. ZIPK phosphorylated STAT3 on serine 727 (Ser727) and enhanced STAT3 transcriptional activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of ZIPK expression decreased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)- and IL-6-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. Furthermore, LIF- and IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation stimulated ZIPK activity. Taken together, our data suggest that ZIPK interacts with STAT3 within the nucleus to regulate the transcriptional activity of STAT3 via phosphorylation of Ser727.",
