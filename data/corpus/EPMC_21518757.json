  "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins are cytoplasmic regulatory molecules that function as signal transducers for receptors involved in both innate and adaptive humoral immune responses. In this study, we show that TRAF7, the unique noncanonical member of the TRAF family, physically associates with IκB kinase/NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and with the RelA/p65 (p65) member of the NF-κB transcription factor family. TRAF7 promotes Lys-29-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO and p65 that results in lysosomal degradation of both proteins and altered activation. TRAF7 also influences p65 nuclear distribution. Microarray expression data are consistent with an inhibitory role for TRAF7 on NF-κB and a positive control of AP-1 transcription factor. Finally, functional data indicate that TRAF7 promotes cell death. Thus, this study identifies TRAF7 as a NEMO- and p65-interacting molecule and brings important information on the ubiquitination events that control NF-κB transcriptional activity.",
