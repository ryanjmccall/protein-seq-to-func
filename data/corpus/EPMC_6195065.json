    "abstract_text": "The sites of cleavage in the \"bait region\" of human alpha 2-macroglobulin made by both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, as the first step in their inactivation by this inhibitor, have been identified. These positions are at a valylhistidyl bond for elastase and a phenylalanyl-tyrosyl bond for cathepsin G. All of the proteinases tested so far, including those utilized in this study, are cleaving within a twenty-seven aminoacid peptide sequence occurring between two proline residues. It is suggested that this area represents the outer limits of the \"bait region\" loop.",
