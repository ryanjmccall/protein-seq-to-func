  "abstract_text": "<b>Introduction</b>: PDAC is a lethal malignancy with a clear unmet need; almost all patients fail 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> line multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been identified as a key signaling node enhancing tumor survival and drug resistance in PDAC; hence, it is considered a promising therapeutic target. <b>Areas covered</b>: We comprehensively reviewed the evidence from preclinical and phase I and II clinical trials, based on the authors'clinical experience and a PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and Google Scholar search everolimus + pancreatic cancer. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Everolimus has not demonstrated efficacy in PDAC; however, an mTOR inhibitor in combination with stroma-targeted therapies may be a promising area to explore in clinical trials.",
