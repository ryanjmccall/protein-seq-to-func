  "abstract_text": "Maintenance of oxygen homoeostasis is the basic principle in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and function in all higher organisms. The transcription factor, HIF (hypoxia inducible factor) has a central role in oxygen homoeostasis, and is indispensably linked to energy metabolism. Abnormally reduced oxygen concentrations leading to dysfunctional cell metabolism are found in rheumatoid arthritis and hence, knowledge of the molecular adaptive responses to hypoxia and the involvement of HIF in the pathogenesis of RA are interesting.",
