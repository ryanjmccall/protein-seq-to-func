    "abstract_text": "G25K is a low-molecular-mass GTP-binding protein with a broad distribution in mammalian tissues. A cDNA clone was isolated by using oligonucleotides corresponding to the partial amino acid sequence of purified human G25K. The cDNA encodes an 191-amino-acid polypeptide containing GTP-binding consensus sequences and a putative farnesylation site at the C terminus. The sequence exhibits 50 and 70% identities to the mammalian rho and rac proteins, respectively, and an 80% identity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC42 gene product. Insect Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus vectors expressing the G25K cDNA produced a 25-kDa protein that bound GTP and was recognized by antibodies specifically reactive to G25K. G25K appears to be the human homolog of the CDC42 gene product, since expression of the G25K cDNA in S. cerevisiae suppressed both cdc42-1 and cdc24-4 temperature-sensitive lethal mutations.",
