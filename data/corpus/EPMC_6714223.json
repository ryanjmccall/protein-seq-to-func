    "abstract_text": "The nucleotide sequence of a HindIII-EcoRI DNA fragment, 8 kbp long, of a lambda recombinant containing the whole human c-myc gene has been deduced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert. This fragment encodes the complex c-myc locus and the sequence provides information relative to the 2.7 kb long c-myc transcript. It appears that although exons 2 and 3 would code for a 48-K protein homologous to the myc domain of the viral p110 gag-myc protein, the first exon, which has a large open reading frame ending with a stop codon just upstream from the donor splice site, could code on its own for a 20-K protein. Speculations about the role of that putative protein on the regulation of the expression of exons 2 and 3 are made.",
