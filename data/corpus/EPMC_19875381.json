  "title": "A proteomic investigation of ligand-dependent HSP90 complexes reveals CHORDC1 as a novel ADP-dependent HSP90-interacting protein.",

  "abstract_text": "Structural studies of the chaperone HSP90 have revealed that nucleotide and drug ligands induce several distinct conformational states; however, little is known how these conformations affect interactions with co-chaperones and client proteins. Here we use tandem affinity purification and LC-MS/MS to investigate the proteome-wide effects of ATP, ADP, and geldanamycin on the constituents of the human HSP90 interactome. We identified 52 known and novel components of HSP90 complexes that are regulated by these ligands, including several co-chaperones. Interestingly, our results also show that geldanamycin treatment causes HSP90 complexes to become significantly enriched for core transcription machinery, suggesting that HSP90 inhibition may have broad based effects on transcription and RNA processing. We further characterized a novel ADP-dependent HSP90 interaction with the cysteine- and histidine-rich domain (CHORD)-containing protein CHORDC1. We show that this interaction is stimulated by high ADP:ATP ratios in cell lysates and in vitro with purified recombinant proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction is dependent upon the ability of HSP90 to bind nucleotides and requires the presence of a linker region between the CHORD domains in CHORDC1. Together these findings suggest that the HSP90 interactome is dynamic with respect to nucleotide and drug ligands and that pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 may stimulate the formation of specific complexes.",
