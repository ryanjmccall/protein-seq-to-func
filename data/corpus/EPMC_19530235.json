    "abstract_text": "Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor often arises sporadically; however, in a subgroup of patients, there exist familial conditions such as Fanconi anemia with biallelic BRCA2 mutation that predispose patients to developing medulloblastoma. Biallelic inactivation of BRCA2 in Fanconi anemia has been previously described in only 11 patients with medulloblastoma in the literature to date. Here we report two siblings diagnosed with central nervous system embryonal tumors at an early age in association with biallelic BRCA2 inactivation, including the first reported case of a spinal cord primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) in a BRCA2/FANCD1 kindred.",
