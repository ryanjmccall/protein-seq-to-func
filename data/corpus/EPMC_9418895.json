  "title": "Expression of constitutively active IkappaB beta in T cells of transgenic mice: persistent NF-kappaB activity is required for T-cell immune responses.",

  "abstract_text": "The transcription factor NF-kappaB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by members of the IkappaB family, including IkappaB alpha, IkappaB beta, and the recently cloned IkappaB epsilon. Upon cellular activation, these inhibitors are rapidly phosphorylated on two amino-terminal serines, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the 26S proteasome, releasing a functional NF-kappaB. To determine the importance of IkappaB beta in NF-kappaB regulation in T cells, we generated transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active IkappaB beta mutant (mIkappaB beta) under the control of the lck promoter. The transgene contains the two critical N-terminal serine residues mutated to alanines and therefore no longer susceptible to degradation upon cell activation. mIkappaB beta is unable to totally displace IkappaB alpha from RelA-containing complexes, thus allowing a transient activation of NF-kappaB upon T-cell stimulation. However, mIkappaB beta completely blocks NF-kappaB activity after IkappaB alpha degradation. In addition, as a consequence of this inhibition, ikba expression is down regulated, along with that of other NF-kappaB-regulated genes. These transgenic mice have a significant reduction in the peripheral T-cell population, especially CD8+ cells. The remaining T cells have impaired proliferation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus phytohemagglutinin or calcium ionophore but not to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 costimulation. As a result of these alterations, transgenic animals present defects in immune responses such as delayed-type hypersensitivity and the generation of specific antibodies against T-cell-dependent antigens. These results show that in nonstimulated T cells, IkappaB beta cannot efficiently displace IkappaB alpha bound to RelA-containing complexes and that persistent NF-kappaB activity is required for proper T-cell responses in vivo.",
