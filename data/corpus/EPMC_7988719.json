    "abstract_text": "A PCR approach has been employed to screen two cDNA libraries for PKC(-related) sequences. In each case multiple cDNAs were identified, including known PKC isotypes, a previously unknown PKC-eta related sequence and three members of what appears to be a protein kinase C related kinase (PRK 1-3) family. The origin and relationships of these predicted proteins is discussed.",
