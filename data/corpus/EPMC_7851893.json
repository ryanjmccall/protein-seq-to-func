    "abstract_text": "A lymphoid-specific member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family has been identified by PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides. We have determined that this receptor, also reported as the Epstein-Barr-induced cDNA EBI1, is expressed in normal lymphoid tissues and in several B- and T-lymphocyte cell lines. While the function and the ligand for EBI1 remain unknown, its sequence and gene structure suggest that it is related to the receptors that recognize chemoattractants, such as interleukin-8, RANTES, C5a, and fMet-Leu-Phe. Like the chemoattractant receptors, EBI1 contains intervening sequences near its 5' end; however, EBI1 is unique in that both of its introns interrupt the coding region of the first extracellular domain. The gene is encoded on human chromosome 17q12-q21.2. None of the other G-protein-coupled receptors has been mapped to this region, but the C-C chemokine family has been mapped to 17q11-q21. The mouse EBI1 cDNA has also been isolated and encodes a protein with 86% identity to the human homolog.",
