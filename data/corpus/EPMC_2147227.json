  "abstract_text": "The 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene contains, from nucleotides -291 to -298, a sequence (TGA CGTCA) which mediates cyclic AMP (cAMP) responsiveness in several genes (cAMP-responsive element [CRE]). However, because of nonpermissive bases surrounding the CRE octamer, the glucagon CRE does not confer cAMP responsiveness to an inert heterologous promoter in placental JEG cells that do not express the glucagon gene. This report describes transient transfection experiments with glucagon-reporter fusion genes that show that glucagon gene expression is activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A in a glucagon-expressing pancreatic islet cell line. This activation is mediated through the glucagon CRE.",
