    "abstract_text": "<h4>Background</h4>As a processing method of RNA precursors, alternative splicing (AS) is critical to normal cellular activities. Aberrant AS events are associated with cancer development and can be promising targets to treat cancer. However, no detailed and unbiased study describes the current state of AS of cancer research. We aim to measure and recognize the current state and trends of AS cancer research in this study.<h4>Methods</h4>The Web of Science Core Collection was used to acquire the articles. Utilizing three bibliometric tools (CiteSpace, VOSviewer, R-bibliometrix), we were able to measure and recognize the influence and collaboration data of individual articles, journals, and co-citations. Analysis of co-occurrence and burst information helped us identify the trending research areas related to AS of cancer.<h4>Results</h4>From 2012 to 2021, the total number of papers on AS of cancer published in 766 academic journals was 3,507, authored by 20,406 researchers in 405 institutions from 80 countries/regions. Research involving AS of cancer genes was primarily conducted in the United States and China; simultaneously, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fudan University, and National Cancer Institute were the institutions with strong research capabilities. Scorilas Andreas is the scholar with the most publications, while the most co-citations were generated by Wang, Eric T. Plos One published the most papers on AS of cancer, while J Biol Chem was the most co-cited academic journal in this field. The results of keyword co-occurrence analysis can be divided into three types: molecular (P53, CD44, androgen receptor, srsf3, esrp1), pathological process (apoptosis, EMT, metastasis, angiogenesis, proliferation), and disease (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Research on AS of cancer has been increasing in intensity over the past decade. Current AS of cancer studies focused on the hallmarks of AS in cancer and AS signatures including diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Among them, the current trends are splicing factors regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other hallmarks, aberrant splicing events in tumors, and further mechanisms. These might give researchers interested in this field a forward-looking perspective and inform further research.",
