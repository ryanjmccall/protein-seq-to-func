  "abstract_text": "Three of 16 human gastric adenocarcinoma samples, maintained as solid tumors in nude mice, were found to carry amplified c-myc genes. In two samples with a high degree of c-myc DNA amplification (15- to 30-fold), double minute chromosomes were observed in karyotype analysis. The level of c-myc RNA was markedly elevated in a rapidly growing and poorly differentiated tumor, whereas it was only slightly elevated in a slowly growing and more differentiated tumor.",
