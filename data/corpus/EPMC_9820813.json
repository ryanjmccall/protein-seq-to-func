  "abstract_text": "The functionality of the C-terminus (Ser-Asn-Leu; SNL) of human d-aspartate oxidase, an enzyme proposed to have a role in the inactivation of synaptically released d-aspartate, as a peroxisome-targeting signal (PTS1) was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Bacterially expressed human d-aspartate oxidase was shown to interact with the human PTS1-binding protein, peroxin protein 5 (PEX5p). Binding was gradually abolished by carboxypeptidase treatment of the oxidase and competitively inhibited by a Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL)-containing peptide. After transfection of mouse fibroblasts with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) extended by PKSNL (the C-terminal pentapeptide of the oxidase), a punctate fluorescent pattern was evident. The modified GFP co-localized with peroxisomal thiolase as shown by indirect immunofluorescence. On transfection in fibroblasts lacking PEX5p receptor, GFP-PKSNL staining was cytosolic. Peroxisomal import of GFP extended by PGSNL (replacement of the positively charged fourth-last amino acid by glycine) seemed to be slower than that of GFP-PKSNL, whereas extension by PKSNG abolished the import of the modified GFP. Taken together, these results indicate that SNL, a tripeptide not fitting the PTS1 consensus currently defined in mammalian systems, acts as a functional PTS1 in mammalian systems, and that the consensus sequence, based on this work and that of other groups, has to be broadened to (S/A/C/K/N)-(K/R/H/Q/N/S)-L.",
