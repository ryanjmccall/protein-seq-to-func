    "abstract_text": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitylation, leading to diverse physiological consequences and modulation of its biological activity. There is increasing evidence that methylation may parallel other post-translational modifications in the regulation of various biological processes. It is still not known, however, whether EGFR is regulated by this post-translational event. Here, we show that EGFR Arg\u00a01175 is methylated by an arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5. Arg\u00a01175 methylation positively modulates EGF-induced EGFR trans-autophosphorylation at Tyr\u00a01173, which governs ERK activation. Abolishment of Arg\u00a01175 methylation enhances EGF-stimulated ERK activation by reducing SHP1 recruitment to EGFR, resulting in augmented cell proliferation, migration and invasion of EGFR-expressing cells. Therefore, we propose a model in which the regulatory crosstalk between PRMT5-mediated Arg\u00a01175 methylation and EGF-induced Tyr\u00a01173 phosphorylation attenuates EGFR-mediated ERK activation.",
