    "abstract_text": "The chaperone-related p97 protein plays a central role in various cellular processes involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The diverse functions of p97 are controlled by a large number of cofactors that recruit specific substrates or influence their ubiquitylation state. Many cofactors bind through a UBX or PUB domain, two major p97 binding modules. However, the recently identified UBXD1 cofactor possesses both domains. To elucidate the molecular basis underlying the interaction between UBXD1 and p97, we analyzed the contribution of both domains to p97 binding biochemically and in living cells. The PUB domain mediated robust binding to the carboxy-terminus of p97, while the UBX domain did not contribute to p97 binding. Importantly, we identified an additional p97 binding site in UBXD1 that competed with the p47 cofactor for binding to the N domain of p97. This novel, bipartite binding mode suggests that UBXD1 could be an efficient regulator of p97 cofactor interactions.",
