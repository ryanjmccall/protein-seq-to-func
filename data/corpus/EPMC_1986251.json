    "abstract_text": "A temperature-sensitive mutant of p53, p53Val-135, was found to be able to arrest cell proliferation when overexpressed at 32.5 degrees C. While much of the protein was cytoplasmic in cells proliferating at 37.5 degrees C, it became predominantly nuclear at 32.5 degrees C. Concomitantly, p53Val-135 became destabilized, although not to the extent seen in primary fibroblasts.",
