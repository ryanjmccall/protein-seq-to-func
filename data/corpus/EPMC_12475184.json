  "abstract_text": "We compared the effects ofAlzheimer's peptide (Abeta1-42), a,-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and an ACT/Abeta1-42 mixture on human glioma DK-MG cells. The solution of Abeta (5 microM) formed by 2-h incubation at room temperature induced tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels by 55 and 45%, respectively, and increased gelatinase B activity by 67%, while exposure of cells to the ACT/Abeta1-42 mixture (1:10 molar ratio ACT: Abeta1-42) under the same experimental conditions showed no effect on IL-6 levels or gelatinase B activity, but strongly induced TNF-alpha (by 190%), compared to the controls. Stimulation of the cells with Abeta1-42 alone, but not with ACT, increased by about 20% low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and mRNA levels for LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase, while the ACT/Abeta1-42 mixture significantly increased LDL uptake (by 50%), up-regulated mRNA levels for LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase by 48 and 63%, respectively, and increased lipid accumulation by about 20-fold. These data suggest a possible new role for Abeta in Alzheimer's disease through its interaction with the inflammatory reactant, ACT.",
