  "abstract_text": "The solution structure of the central domain of the human nucleotide excision repair protein XPA, which binds to damaged DNA and replication protein A (RPA), was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The central domain consists of a zinc-containing subdomain and a C-terminal subdomain. The zinc-containing subdomain has a compact globular structure and is distinct from the zinc-fingers found in transcription factors. The C-terminal subdomain folds into a novel alpha/beta structure with a positively charged superficial cleft. From the NMR spectra of the complexes, DNA and RPA binding surfaces are suggested.",
