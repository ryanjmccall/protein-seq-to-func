Significance Progerin is a variant of lamin A/C and causes about 90% of Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) cases, a rare premature aging disease. This variant is also detected in normal individuals. We provide evidence linking nuclear envelope (NE) budding and accelerated aging. More importantly, we identify a NE budding inhibitor chaetocin by high-throughput screening. Chaetocin inhibits NE budding by sequestering progerin from the NE, which is dependent on sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation. Chaetocin treatment alleviates telomere loss in vitro and in vivo and improves progeria defects and extends lifespan of progeria mice. Our study uncovers that progerin-induced NE budding participates in the process of progeria and provides insights into HGPS intervention.

Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome progerin NE budding chromatin loss ERK1/2 The nuclear envelope (NE) is mainly composed of an outer nuclear membrane and an inner nuclear membrane (INM), separated by a perinuclear cisterna and studded with many nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that gate material transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( 1 ). Underlying the INM is a lining meshwork, the nuclear lamina (NL), which mainly consists of lamin proteins and plays important roles in DNA replication, DNA damage repair, gene transcription, and chromatin organization ( 1 – 3 ). Mutations in genes encoding lamin proteins cause a variety of genetic disorders known as laminopathies, including Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) ( 4 – 8 ). HGPS is a rare premature aging disease, with approximately 90% of cases being caused by the expression of progerin, a lamin variant resulting from a spontaneously heterozygous c.1824C>T mutation in the LMNA gene encoding lamin A/C ( 9 – 11 ). Progerin is also detected in normal individuals ( 12 , 13 ), and displays dominant-negative behavior and causes a series of nuclear abnormalities, including NE lobulation, decreases in lamin B and lamina-associated polypeptide levels, NPCs clustering, and epigenetic changes ( 14 – 17 ). Ectopic expression of progerin in mice contributes to retarded growth, loss of subcutaneous fat, progressive loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and premature death, which are similar to the symptoms of HGPS patients ( 18 , 19 ). While many lines of evidence suggest that progerin is toxic, how progerin accelerates aging is still an interesting question. In this work, we provide evidence linking NE budding and accelerated aging, and identify a NE budding inhibitor chaetocin by high-throughput screening, which inhibits NE budding by sequestering progerin from the NE and improves the progeria defects of HGPS mice. Results Progerin Expression Induces NE Budding during Pathogenesis of Progeria. We sought to investigate the mechanism underlying aging. In the clinic, we identified four HGPS patients possessing the classical mutation c.1824C>T. Representatively, HGPS 1 is 13 y old and HGPS 2 is 3 mo old, and HGPS 1 showed more severe progeria symptoms than HGPS 2 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 A and B ). We isolated primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) from these four patients and four normal donors and found that HGPS 1 HDFs expressed more progerin than HGPS 2 HDFs ( Fig. 1 A ). Consistent with this, immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) revealed that HGPS 1 HDFs had a higher percentage of cells expressing progerin than HGPS 2 HDFs at the single-cell level ( Fig. 1 B and C ). Interestingly, HGPS HDFs showed a significant NE budding phenomenon, with an average percentage of 7.2% in HGPS HDFs and 2.1% in normal HDFs ( Fig. 1 D and E ), indicating that progerin may induce NE budding. To test this, ectopic expression of progerin was performed in several cell lines and the dramatic induction of NE budding was observed in HeLa cells (29%), L929 cells (81%), NRK cells (69%), and normal HDFs (29.2%) ( Fig. 1 F – I ). Live-cell imaging further revealed the process of NE budding out of the nucleus in normal HDFs and NRK cells induced by progerin ( Fig. 1 J , SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A and B , and Movies S1 and S2 ). These data suggest that progerin can induce NE budding in vitro. Furthermore, we generated HGPS mice ( Lmna G609G/G609G ) and found that Lmna G609G/G609G mice showed more severe progeria symptoms than Lmna G609G/+ mice ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 C – G ). We isolated primary mouse dermal fibroblasts (MDFs) and found that Lmna G609G/G609G MDFs expressed more progerin than Lmna +/+ or Lmna G609G/+ MDFs ( Fig. 1 K ), and Lmna G609G/G609G MDFs had a higher percentage of cells expressing progerin than Lmna G609G/+ MDFs ( Fig. 1 L and M ). Accordingly, Lmna G609G/G609G MDFs had a higher percentage of cells possessing NE buds than Lmna G609G/+ MDFs ( Fig. 1 N ), and progerin-positive Lmna G609G/G609G MDFs had a significantly higher percentage of cells possessing NE buds than progerin-negative Lmna G609G/G609G MDFs ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 C ). These data suggest that progerin induces the unusual NE budding in a dose-dependent manner during pathogenesis of progeria in vivo. Fig. 1. Progerin expression induces NE budding.

( T ) Percentage of cells possessing NE buds in S . n = 6 biologically independent replicates, and 100 cells were analyzed in each replicate. (Scale bars, 10 μm in B , D , F , H , J , L , Q , and S and 3 μm in O and P .) Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, calculated using one-way ANOVA in C , M , and N , and an unpaired t test in E , G , I , R , and T . Next, we studied the manner by which progerin induces NE budding. Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) revealed that the NL in progerin-expressing cells was disrupted and its stability was impaired ( Fig. 1 O ). Since progerin interacts with lamin A/C but not lamin B1 ( 20 ), we evaluated whether progerin directly induces NE budding or works in concert with lamin A/C. We generated LMNA knockout (KO) HeLa cells and found that LMNA knockout did not induce NE budding ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 D , E , H , and I ). Interestingly, ectopic expression of progerin in LMNA KO HeLa cells did not disrupt the NL ( Fig. 1 P ), and accordingly progerin induced less NE budding in LMNA KO HeLa cells than in wild type (WT) ( Fig. 1 Q and R ), suggesting that without the involvement of lamin A/C, progerin cannot efficiently disrupt the NL and induce NE budding. Since emerin plays an important role in NE elasticity ( 21 , 22 ), we further investigated whether emerin takes part in progerin-induced NE budding. We also generated EMD KO HeLa cells and found that EMD knockout did not induce NE budding ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 F , G , J , and K ). Unexpectedly, ectopic expression of progerin in EMD KO HeLa cells more severely disrupted the NL ( Fig. 1 P ), and accordingly progerin induced significantly more NE budding in EMD KO HeLa cells than in WT ( Fig. 1 S and T ), suggesting that emerin maintains the stabilities of the NE and NL and prevents progerin-induced NE budding. Taking these data together, we propose that progerin and lamin A/C work in concert to disrupt the NL and induce this NE budding, and that emerin antagonizes this process by maintaining the stabilities of the NE and NL ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 L ). NE Bud Degradation Causes Chromatin and Telomere Loss. Live-cell imaging revealed the release of NE buds from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1 J and SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A and B ), and IF and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) analyses showed that the NE buds contained lamin A/C, lamin B1, progerin, NE, NPCs, and chromatin ( Fig. 1 D , SI Appendix , Fig. S3 A – C , and Movie S3 ), suggesting that NE budding transports chromatin out of the nucleus. We next studied the fate of the cytoplasmic NE buds. Previous studied showed that autophagy mediates the degradation of lamin B1 and progerin ( 23 , 24 ), we tested whether cytoplasmic NE buds are cleared by autophagy. IF analyses revealed the colocalization of NE buds with LC3 ( Fig. 2 A and C ), a key soluble component of autophagy, and also showed the colocalization of NE buds with lysosomes and the degradation process of NE buds in lysosomes by labeling LAMP1, a lysosomal marker ( Fig. 2 B and C ), indicating that cytoplasmic NE buds can be degraded by autophagy. To further prove this, we treated cells with autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA) and chloroquine (CQ) and tested the degradation of the contents in NE buds in HGPS HDFs. The results showed that the degradation of the NE bud contents including histone H3 and progerin, was dramatically inhibited by BafA and CQ ( Fig. 2 D – F ). These data suggest that the cytoplasmic NE buds are cleared by autophagy, which may cause chromatin loss. Fig. 2. NE bud degradation causes chromatin and telomere loss.

( J ) Percentage of NE buds possessing telomeres in MDFs from WT and HGPS mice. n = 4 biologically independent replicates, and 30 NE buds were analyzed in each replicate. ( K ) Protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 in HGPS HDFs treated with 1 μM BafA or 50 μM CQ for 12 h. ( L ) Protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 in normal and HGPS HDFs. ( M ) Protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 in normal HDFs expressing GFP or GFP-progerin. ( N – T ) Protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 in tissues of the heart, liver, lung, small intestine, kidney, skin, and spleen from WT and HGPS mice. (Scale bars, 10 μm.) Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, calculated using an unpaired t test. TRF1 and TRF2, two important components of telomeres ( 25 – 27 ), were observed in NE buds, and approximately 26% of NE buds contained telomeres in HGPS HDFs and MDFs ( Fig. 2 G – J and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 D and E ), suggesting that NE budding can also transport telomeres out of the nucleus. Interestingly, we found that in LMNA KO HeLa cells expressing GFP-progerin, the percentage of NE buds containing telomere was significantly reduced ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 F and G ), indicating that lamin A/C is crucial for the distribution of telomeres into the NE buds. Furthermore, the degradation of TRF1 and TRF2 was also dramatically inhibited by BafA and CQ ( Fig. 2 K ). These data further suggest that the cytoplasmic NE buds are degraded by autophagy, leading to telomere loss. Considering that HGPS HDFs performed more NE budding than normal HDFs, we speculated that more chromatin and telomere were lost in HGPS cells than in normal cells. To prove this, we tested the levels of TRF1 and TRF2 and found that the protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 were significantly reduced in HGPS HDFs and GFP-progerin-expressing HDFs while their mRNA levels remained stable or were only slightly decreased ( Fig. 2 L and M and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 H and I ). Consistently, the protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 in tissues of the heart, liver, lung, small intestine, kidney, skin, and spleen from HGPS mice ( Lmna G609G/G609G ), were also markedly decreased than those from WT mice ( Lmna +/+ ), whereas the mRNA levels of TRF1 and TRF2 in these tissues were increased or only slightly decreased ( Fig. 2 N – T and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 J – P ). These data suggest that chromatin and telomere loss severely occur in HGPS by NE budding. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the NE buds transport at least some chromatin and telomeres from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the degradation of NE buds via autophagy causes chromatin and telomere loss, eventually leading to the progeria. Chaetocin Inhibits NE Budding by Sequestering Progerin from the NE. Next, we explored how to inhibit NE budding and whether inhibiting NE budding could slow down aging. Since the C611S mutation (cysteine > serine) in progerin disrupts its localization on the NE ( 28 ), we tested whether this NE localization-deficient mutation of progerin affects NE budding. The C611S mutant remained distant from the NE, accumulated in the nucleoplasm, and did not efficiently induce NE budding like WT progerin ( Fig. 3 A and B ). These data suggest that the NE localization of progerin is necessary for the induction of NE budding, and sequestration of progerin from the NE can prevent NE budding and hence evade chromatin and telomere loss in progerin-expressing cells. To inhibit progerin-induced NE budding, we designed a high-throughput screening strategy to identify chemical compounds with the ability to sequester progerin from the NE ( Fig. 3 C ). Briefly, GFP-progerin-expressing HDFs were seeded and cultured on 96-well plates. After confluence, cells were treated with chemical compounds from the Natural Product Library (MedChemExpress) for 24 h. Then, treated cells were performed live-cell imaging by Operetta ® CLS™ high-content screening system (Perkin Elmer). The high-content screening system was equipped with 20×/1.0 NA and 40×/1.15 NA water-immersion objectives, and a 488-nm laser and a 525/50-nm emission filter were used to image green fluorescence. A total of 5,243 natural products were used to perform high-content screening. In control GFP-progerin-expressing HDFs, GFP-progerin localized in the NE and the nucleus was imaged as a green circle. In GFP-progerin-expressing HDFs with treatment of candidate chemical compounds, GFP-progerin aggregated and sequestered from the NE, and the nucleus was imaged as a green circle with green aggregates. Based on this screening standard, candidate chemical compounds that sequester progerin from the NE were screened by the high-content screening system. Fig. 3.

( K ) Representative live-cell imaging of the rescue process of NE budding in GFP-progerin-expressing HDFs treated with 50 nM chaetocin.

( L ) Representative images of NE buds in HGPS HDFs treated with 50 nM chaetocin for 24 h. NE bud (arrow). ( M ) Percentage of cells possessing NE buds in L . n = 6 biologically independent replicates, and 100 cells were analyzed in each replicate. (Scale bars, 10 μm.) Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, calculated using an unpaired t test. Strikingly, we found that chaetocin, a natural product produced by the Chaetomium species of fungi ( 29 , 30 ), could efficiently sequester progerin from the NE and promote progerin accumulation in the nucleoplasm, with no effect on the protein level of progerin and the localization of lamin A ( Fig. 3 D – G , SI Appendix , Fig. S4 A and B , and Movie S4 ). To determine the effective concentration of chaetocin, we performed the concentration gradient experiments in vitro. The results showed that 10 nM chaetocin could not sequester progerin from the NE, 25 nM chaetocin only caused few cells to perform progerin sequestration, and 50 nM and 75 nM and 100 nM chaetocin could efficiently promote cells to perform progerin sequestration ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 C ). Therefore, we treated cells with 50 nM chaetocin in the following experiments in vitro. We further performed in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of chaetocin in mice and observed that chaetocin had a bioavailability of 12% ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 D ). To further observe progerin sequestration from the NE, we performed live-cell imaging in GFP-progerin-expressing HDFs and found that progerin gradually accumulated and sequestered from the NE after chaetocin treatment ( Fig. 3 H and Movie S5 ). These data suggest that chaetocin can sequester progerin from the NE. As expected, IF analysis and live-cell imaging showed that progerin sequestration from the NE by chaetocin dramatically inhibited NE budding in GFP-progerin-expressing HDFs ( Fig. 3 I – K and Movie S6 ). Consistently, chaetocin treatment also efficiently sequestered endogenous progerin from the NE and inhibited NE budding in HGPS HDFs ( Fig. 3 L and M ). These data suggest that chaetocin could efficiently inhibit NE budding by sequestering progerin from the NE. Taking these data together, we conclude that the NE localization of progerin is prerequisites for the induction of NE budding, and identify that the natural product chaetocin can inhibit NE budding by sequestering progerin from the NE. Progerin Sequestration by Chaetocin Is Dependent on Sustained Activation of ERK1/2 Signaling. We further explored the underlying mechanism of progerin sequestration by chaetocin. IF analyses showed that, in a manner different from the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) lonafarnib, which sequestered progerin, lamin A/C, and lamin B1 from the NE ( Fig. 4 A and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 F – H ) ( 28 , 31 – 33 ), chaetocin specifically sequestered progerin from the NE, with no effect on lamin A/C or lamin B1 ( Fig. 4 A and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 A , B , and E – H ). Biochemical analysis further revealed that, unlike FTI treatment, which generates prelamin A ( 19 , 32 – 34 ), chaetocin treatment did not ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 I ), suggesting that chaetocin does not affect the farnesyltransferase. Moreover, progerin sequestered by chaetocin did not colocalize with emerin or LC3, and did not affect their localization ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 J and K ), indicating that neither emerin nor LC3 meditates progerin sequestration. Since chaetocin shows inhibitory effects on histone methyltransferase SU(VAR)3-9 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 0.6 μM in Drosophila melanogaster ( 35 ), we investigated whether SUV39H1 is involved in progerin sequestration from the NE in HDFs. 50 to 150 nM chaetocin treatment efficiently sequestered progerin from the NE ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 C ); however, these treatments had no effect on H3K9m3 and H3K27m3 levels in HDFs ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 L ), indicating that SUV39H1 is not involved in chaetocin-mediated progerin sequestration from the NE.

Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, calculated using one-way ANOVA in B , and an unpaired t test in H . Next, we sought to elucidate the target of chaetocin by screening kinase inhibitors. Among the inhibitors of ERK1/2 (FR180204), MAPK/ERK kinase1/2 (MEK1/2) (U0126, PD0325901), cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2/5 (CDK1/2/5) (RO3306, Roscovitine), protein kinase C (PKC) (Go6983), and protein kinase A (PKA) (KT5720), only FR180204 markedly disrupted chaetocin-mediated progerin sequestration from the NE ( Fig. 4 B and C ), suggesting that ERK1/2 activation is required for progerin sequestration from the NE by chaetocin. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that chaetocin dramatically activated ERK1/2 ( Fig. 4 D and E ). To further prove that ERK1/2 activation is essential for chaetocin-mediated progerin sequestration from the NE, we knocked down ERK1/2 and subsequently treated cells with chaetocin and found that progerin sequestration by chaetocin was obviously inhibited by ERK1/2 knockdown ( Fig. 4 F – H ). These data suggest that progerin sequestration by chaetocin is dependent on ERK1/2 activation. Interestingly, inhibition of canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling alone by FR180204, U0126, or PD0325901 did not sequester progerin from the NE ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 M ), nor did activation of canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling alone by epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) ( Fig. 4 I ), suggesting that canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling is not involved in progerin sequestration from the NE. To clarify why the chaetocin-activated ERK1/2 signaling, but not the canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling, could mediate progerin sequestration from the NE, we tested the strength and duration of ERK1/2 activation in time course of TPA (the activator of canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling) and chaetocin treatment. Biochemical analyses showed that, TPA treatment transiently activated the canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling, and the duration of ERK1/2 activation only maintained for 1 h and then the strength of ERK1/2 activation quickly returned to a regular level ( Fig. 4 J , K , L , and N ), indicating that the TPA-activated canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling only keeps a transient activation of ERK1/2. In contrast, chaetocin started to activate ERK1/2 signaling after 4 h of treatment, and the duration of ERK1/2 activation sustained at least up to 24 h after treatment ( Fig. 4 J , K , M , and N ), suggesting that chaetocin can keep sustained activation of ERK1/2. Since short time (such as 12 h) of chaetocin treatment cannot efficiently sequester progerin from the NE ( Fig. 3 H and Movie S5 ), we propose that sustained ERK1/2 activation is necessary for progerin sequestration. Furthermore, we observed that chaetocin did not activate MEK1/2 ( Fig. 4 J , K , and M ), suggesting that chaetocin-activated ERK1/2 is independent of MEK1/2, which is different from the canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway ( 36 , 37 ). These data explain why MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 or PD0325901 had no effect on chaetocin-mediated progerin sequestration ( Fig. 4 B ). Since dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) mediate MAPKs activation and DUSP6 (also named MKP3) deficiency activates ERK1/2 ( 38 – 42 ), we then explored whether DUSPs are involved in chaetocin-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Biochemical analyses showed that chaetocin treatment significantly decreased DUSP6, the primary phosphatase of ERK1/2 ( 36 ), but did not affect DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP3, DUSP4, DUSP5, DUSP7, DUSP9, and DUSP10 in HDFs ( Fig. 4 O and P ). Consistently, we observed decreased DUSP6 in AML12 and RPE1 cells after chaetocin treatment ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 N ). These data suggest that chaetocin can decrease DUSP6 in different cell lines, and chaetocin may keep sustained ERK1/2 activation by decreasing DUSP6. Collectively, we conclude that progerin sequestration by chaetocin is dependent on sustained activation of ERK1/2 signaling, which may be achieved by decreasing DUSP6. NE Budding Inhibition by Chaetocin Alleviates Telomere Loss and Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) Gene Expression In Vitro and In Vivo. As mentioned before, NE bud degradation causes chromatin and telomere loss in HGPS. Since chaetocin can efficiently inhibit NE budding by sequestering progerin from the NE, we speculated that chaetocin may alleviate NE budding-induced loss of chromatin and telomeres in HGPS. For confirmation, we tested telomere loss. We treated HGPS HDFs and MDFs with chaetocin and examined the protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 and found that they were greatly increased ( Fig. 5 A and B ). Relative telomere length analyses further revealed that chaetocin lengthened telomeres in HGPS HDFs ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 E ). These data suggest that following chaetocin treatment, telomere loss was ameliorated in vitro. Fig. 5. NE budding inhibition by chaetocin alleviates telomere loss and SASP gene expression in vitro and in vivo. ( A ) Protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 in HGPS HDFs treated with 50 nM chaetocin for 24 h.

(Scale bar, 50 μm.) Data are expressed as the mean ± SD, calculated using one-way ANOVA in D , and an unpaired t test in K – P . We further examined the in vivo effect of chaetocin on NE budding and telomere loss in HGPS mice. Based on other studies ( 43 , 44 ) and our pilot experiments ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 O and P ), HGPS mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 mg/kg chaetocin or vehicle every 3 d after postnatal 4 wk, and their tissues were analyzed after 3 mo of treatment. Immunohistochemistry revealed that NL abnormalities and cytoplasmic lamin A/C-containing NE buds existed in the HGPS mice tissues we tested, including the liver, kidney, and heart, and chaetocin treatment significantly improved these defects ( Fig. 5 C and D and SI Appendix , Fig. S5 A – D ), indicating that chaetocin treatment maintains normal nuclear stability and inhibits NE budding in vivo. Consistent with this, biochemical analyses showed that the protein levels of TRF1 and TRF2 were dramatically increased in tissues of the liver, small intestine, lung, kidney, spleen, and heart from HGPS mice following chaetocin treatment, but their mRNA levels were relatively unchanged or decreased ( Fig. 5 E – J and SI Appendix , Fig. S5 L – Q ). Relative telomere length analyses further revealed that telomere lengths were extended in these tissues from HGPS mice treated with chaetocin ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 F – K ). These data demonstrate that chaetocin treatment successfully inhibits NE budding and alleviates telomere loss in vivo. Next, we investigated whether chaetocin treatment improves progeria defects. RT-qPCR revealed that SASP gene expression, a classical marker of cell senescence and aging ( 45 ), was dramatically elevated in multiple tissues from HGPS mice, including IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL8, and MMP3 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 R – W ). As expected, chaetocin treatment markedly inhibited these genes expression ( Fig. 5 K – P ), suggesting that chaetocin treatment indeed improves progeria defects. Taking these data together, we conclude that NE budding inhibition by chaetocin may effectively promote the evasion of NE budding-induced telomere loss in HGPS, and reduce SASP gene expression. Chaetocin Extends Lifespan and Ameliorates Histopathological Defects in Progeria Mice. Finally, we further evaluated whether the NE budding inhibitor chaetocin improves the health of progeria mice and extends their lifespan. As expected, 3 mo of chaetocin treatment caused no apparent abnormalities in WT mice ( Fig. 6 A and B ), but did significantly improve kyphosis, hair loss, behavior, and vitality of HGPS mice ( Fig. 6 A , SI Appendix , Fig. S6 A and B , and Movie S7 ). Excitingly, chaetocin treatment markedly extended the lifespan of HGPS mice. While control HGPS mice lived for a median survival of 140 d, the median survival of chaetocin-treated HGPS mice was 160 d, indicating a 14.3% increase in lifespan. The maximum survival time of HGPS mice was extended from 167 d in the control group to 210 d in the chaetocin-treated group, with a 25.7% increase; and the mean survival time was extended from 139.1 d in the control group to 163.1 d in the chaetocin-treated group, with a 17.3% increase ( Fig. 6 C ). We also analyzed the difference of the lifespan extension between male and female HGPS mice and found that chaetocin treatment extended the median survival time of both males and females, respectively an increase of 21.4% in male HGPS mice and 12.2% in female HGPS mice ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 C and D ). We subsequently examined the effect of chaetocin treatment on the body weight of HGPS mice. The body weight of HGPS mice increased continuously until approximately 2 mo of age, and then gradually reduced as progeria pathogenesis developed ( Fig. 6 D and SI Appendix , Fig. S1 E ). Strikingly, in comparison with control HGPS mice, chaetocin-treated HGPS mice exhibited a significantly reduced rate of body weight loss ( Fig. 6 D ). These results demonstrate that chaetocin significantly improves the health status of HGPS mice and extends their lifespan. Fig. 6.

Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM, calculated using one-way ANOVA in D , and mean ± SD, calculated using a Mantel–Cox test in C and one-way ANOVA in E – K . We then examined the pathological features of HGPS mice following chaetocin treatment. HGPS mice exhibited decreased hair follicles and thickened epidermis, and 3 mo of chaetocin treatment dramatically ameliorated these defects ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 E – G ). HGPS mice exhibited severe VSMC loss, adventitial fibrosis, and artery thickening in the heart, and these defects were significantly improved following chaetocin treatment for 3 mo ( Fig. 6 E and F and SI Appendix , Fig. S6 H ). In comparison with WT mice, HGPS mice displayed severe tissue fibrosis, and 3 mo of chaetocin treatment obviously alleviated these defects ( Fig. 6 G – K and SI Appendix , Fig. S6 I – M ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the NE budding inhibitor chaetocin can slow the development of progeria pathogenesis, improve vitality, and prolong lifespan of HGPS mice. Discussion It has been about 20 y since the mutation in LMNA was identified as the cause of HGPS ( 7 , 8 ) and since then, numerous investigations have highlighted that the mutant progerin is toxic and plays a critical role in the pathological development of HGPS. However, the mechanism by which progerin accelerates aging is still an interesting question. In the present study, we provide evidence linking NE budding and accelerated aging. Mechanistically, NE-localized progerin works in concert with lamin A/C to disrupt NL and induce local NE budding, through which chromatin and telomeres are transported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. The chromatin-containing NE buds are then cleared via autophagy, leading to chromatin and telomere loss and thus progeria. Fortunately, we screen a NE budding inhibitor chaetocin and reveal that chaetocin can efficiently inhibit this NE budding by sequestering progerin from the NE, thus promoting evasion of chromatin and telomere loss. Chaetocin treatment alleviates kyphosis, hair loss, body weight loss, VSMC loss, tissue fibrosis, and SASP gene expression and extends lifespan of HGPS mice, indicating that chaetocin could improve the typical symptoms of HGPS. We further identify that chaetocin sequesters progerin from the NE by sustaining ERK1/2 activation ( Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7. A working model of the mechanism by which NE budding inhibition slows down progeria. Progerin expression induces chromatin and telomere loss by promoting NE budding in concert with lamin A/C, which is antagonized by emerin. The cytoplasmic chromatin-containing NE buds are cleared via the autophagy pathway, impairing genome and telomere stabilities and contributing to the pathogenesis of progeria. On the other hand, the natural product chaetocin can keep sustained activation of ERK1/2 signaling, which promotes progerin sequestration from the NE and inhibits NE budding, allowing evasion of chromatin and telomere loss and ameliorating progeria defects. ERK1/2 activation by chaetocin may be achieved through decreasing DUSP6. In conclusion, progerin-induced chromatin and telomere loss participate in the development of progeria, and chaetocin and sustained ERK1/2 activation play an essential role in the anti-aging process by inhibiting NE budding and preventing chromatin and telomere loss. As a lamin A variant, progerin has a high similarity to lamin A ( 11 ). During the formation of the NL, progerin disrupts the normal structure and stability of the NL and induces NE budding with the aid of lamin A/C. Without lamin A/C, the toxicity of progerin is limited. This notion is in accordance with reports that elimination of lamin A ameliorates progeria defects ( 46 , 47 ). Accordingly, intervention of lamin A/C may also hold clinical value in the treatment of laminopathies. In this study, we analyze the percentage of cells with progerin in HGPS HDFs and MDFs by IF analysis, and observe that most cells express progerin, but not all. We think that our IF analysis can only measure a certain amount of progerin, and the progerin below the detection level cannot be observed, and thus those cells with little progerin cannot be observed to express progerin. This may explain why not all cells express progerin from our IF analysis. Genome instability and telomere attrition are hallmarks of aging ( 45 ). Previous study reveals that progerin induces DNA damage in telomeres and chromosomal aberrations in HGPS ( 48 ). Here, we demonstrate that progerin-induced NE budding transports chromatin and telomeres from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and these NE buds are then cleared via autophagy, leading to impairment of genome and telomere stabilities and acceleration of the aging process. More importantly, this NE budding can be avoided in vitro and in vivo through sequestering progerin from the NE by chaetocin, and the telomere loss, as well as the aging-associated defects, can be attenuated. Therefore, we clarify the role of NE budding in aging. In this work, we demonstrate that the natural product chaetocin can efficiently inhibit the NE budding by keeping sustained ERK1/2 signaling activation and promoting sequestration of progerin from the NE. Interestingly, our data show that sustained ERK1/2 activation is necessary for progerin sequestration from the NE, whereas the canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling only keeps transient ERK1/2 activation and is insufficient to sequester progerin from the NE. Moreover, we identify that independent of MEK1/2, chaetocin maybe keep sustained ERK1/2 activation through decreasing DUSP6. As the phosphatase of ERK1/2, DUSP6 deficiency activates ERK1/2 ( 38 – 41 ). Therefore, it is the sustained activation of ERK1/2 signaling that promotes progerin sequestration from the NE and prevents progerin-induced telomere and chromatin loss, indicating that sustained activation of ERK1/2 signaling by targeting DUSP6 may serve as an avenue for HGPS treatment. As to how sustained activation of ERK1/2 sequesters progerin from the NE, we speculate that activated ERK1/2 phosphorylates progerin and phosphorylated progerin disassembles and is sequestered from the NE, which remains to be explored in future study. Other studies report that ERK1/2 is hyperactivation in DCM caused by LMNA mutation, and can alter cardiac actin and microtubule dynamics by the cofilin-1-MRTF-A/SRF signaling ( 49 , 50 ). This suggests that ERK1/2 plays complex roles in diseases, and the treatment strategies based on ERK1/2 signaling need more works to be done. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved FTI for HGPS treatment ( 51 ). FTI targets farnesyltransferase, which is responsible for posttranslational modification of many substrates including progerin, Ras, RhoB, lamin A, lamin B1, and lamin B2 ( 1 , 51 , 52 ). Unlike FTI, chaetocin decreases DUSP6 and specifically sequesters progerin from the NE without affecting lamin A/C or lamin B1, which provides a target and strategy for HGPS treatment. We observe that chaetocin extends the lifespan of HGPS mice by 14.3%. The effect on lifespan is similar to isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) inhibitor UCM-13207 (20% extension) ( 53 ) or a unique progerin C-terminal peptide (UPCP) (17% extension) ( 54 ). Chaetocin sequesters progerin from the NE and inhibits NE budding. ICMT inhibitor UCM-13207 delocalizes progerin from the NE and diminishes its total protein level. UPCP interferes with the interaction between progerin and BUBR1. We think that these compounds mainly affect progerin and counteract progerin toxicity, and thus have similar effects on the lifespan of HGPS mice. Surprisingly, high-fat diet nearly doubles the lifespan of HGPS mice ( 55 ). We think that this may be because of the complex effects of high-fat diet on HGPS mice. Even though no effect on progerin, high-fat diet induces metabolic changes, increases the degradation of phosphatidylcholine, adipocyte size, fat mass, and lean mass, and inhibits muscle breakdown in HGPS mice, which alleviates the progeria defects. Furthermore, high-fat diet increases the gut bacterial load and alters the gut microbiome in mice ( 56 , 57 ), and gut microbiota alteration has beneficial effects on lifespan of HGPS mice ( 58 ). Therefore, high-fat diet has systemic effects on HGPS mice and shows the accumulation of benefits on various tissues and thus has more evident effect on the lifespan of HGPS mice. Interestingly, we notice that vehicle treatment alone also benefits the lifespan of HGPS mice compared to the untreated HGPS mice. In other studies, mock treatment also extends the lifespan of HGPS mice compared to untreated HGPS mice ( 59 , 60 ). We think that the HGPS mice display poor exercise ability and cannot independently acquire enough water and salt in the late period of lifespan, which further affects the lifespan of untreated HGPS mice. Regular vehicle treatment (10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) + 40% polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300) + 5% Tween-80 + 45% saline) by intraperitoneal injection every 3 d provides saline for the HGPS mice and may benefit the lifespan of HGPS mice. Moreover, Tween-80 can decrease the attachment of bacteria and affect lipid accumulation and fatty acid composition of bacteria ( 61 , 62 ), which may also benefit the lifespan of HGPS mice. Whether other contents in vehicle benefit HGPS mice remains to be explored in future study. We think that these reasons may explain why vehicle treatment alone can extend the lifespan of HGPS mice compared to the untreated HGPS mice. Collectively, this suggests that the benefit of counteracting progerin toxicity, such as inhibiting NE budding, is limited, and the combination of different treatment strategies may have more benefits on HGPS patients. In this study, we generate the homozygous HGPS mice by introducing the classical mutation c.1827C>T to Lmna via gene targeting referring to previous study ( 17 ). Previous studies have shown small body, VSMC loss, body weight loss, premature death in homozygous HGPS mice ( 17 , 54 , 63 – 65 ). Consistent with this, we also detect these defects in the homozygous HGPS mice we generate. Moreover, a few studies have revealed the fibrosis of the heart, muscle, and esophagus in homozygous HGPS mice ( 54 , 63 , 66 ). We detect the fibrosis of the heart, kidney, spleen, liver, and lung in our homozygous HGPS mice. Although we didn’t analyze the fibrosis of muscle and esophagus in our homozygous HGPS mice, we think that these tissues may also develop fibrosis. Therefore, based on previous studies and our results, we think that tissue fibrosis is common at least in the heart of homozygous HGPS mice from other groups and our group, which contributes to the progeria. In conclusion, we demonstrate that progerin works in concert with lamin A/C to promote NE budding, which transports chromatin and telomeres from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where they are cleared via the autophagy pathway, leading to telomere and chromatin loss and the development of progeria. The natural product chaetocin can keep sustained ERK1/2 signaling activation, which promotes the sequestration of progerin from the NE and inhibits NE budding, promoting the evasion of telomere and chromatin loss and improving the pathological defects of progeria. These data not only provide insight into the mechanism of HGPS, but also reveal a potential avenue for HGPS treatment. Materials and Methods HGPS mice ( Lmna G609G/G609G ) were generated at Cyagen Bioscience (Suzhou, China) by introducing the classical mutation c.1827C>T to Lmna via gene targeting (referring to ref. 17 ). WT C57BL/6 mice matched for gender and age were used as controls. Mice were housed individually in ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions and fed standard mouse chow. All procedures involving mice were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Peking University, Beijing, China. WT and Lmna G609G/G609G mice were randomly separated into control and chaetocin-treated groups and injected intraperitoneally with vehicle (10% DMSO + 40% PEG300 + 5% Tween-80 + 45% saline) or 0.1 mg/kg chaetocin (dissolved in vehicle) every 3 d for 3 mo from 4 wk of age. The body weight of each mouse was recorded every 3 d from postnatal day 14.

  "plain_text": "Significance Progerin is a variant of lamin A/C and causes about 90% of Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) cases, a rare premature aging disease. This variant is also detected in normal individuals. We provide evidence linking nuclear envelope (NE) budding and accelerated aging. More importantly, we identify a NE budding inhibitor chaetocin by high-throughput screening. Chaetocin inhibits NE budding by sequestering progerin from the NE, which is dependent on sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation. Chaetocin treatment alleviates telomere loss in vitro and in vivo and improves progeria defects and extends lifespan of progeria mice. Our study uncovers that progerin-induced NE budding participates in the process of progeria and provides insights into HGPS intervention.\n\nProgerin causes Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), but how progerin accelerates aging is still an interesting question. Here, we provide evidence linking nuclear envelope (NE) budding and accelerated aging. Mechanistically, progerin disrupts nuclear lamina to induce NE budding in concert with lamin A/C, resulting in transport of chromatin into the cytoplasm where it is removed via autophagy, whereas emerin antagonizes this process. Primary cells from both HGPS patients and mouse models express progerin and display NE budding and chromatin loss, and ectopically expressing progerin in cells can mimic this process. More excitingly, we screen a NE budding inhibitor chaetocin by high-throughput screening, which can dramatically sequester progerin from the NE and prevent this NE budding through sustaining ERK1/2 activation. Chaetocin alleviates NE budding-induced chromatin loss and ameliorates HGPS defects in cells and mice and significantly extends lifespan of HGPS mice. Collectively, we propose that progerin-induced NE budding participates in the induction of progeria, highlight the roles of chaetocin and sustained ERK1/2 activation in anti-aging, and provide a distinct avenue for treating HGPS."
