  "abstract_text": "An updated human heart protein two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) database is presented. The database, which contains some 1388 protein spots characterised in terms of M(r) and pI, has been analysed further by Western immunoblotting and protein sequencing. From a total of 103 protein spots analysed, 49 have been identified by immunoblotting and 32 have been identified by protein sequencing. A further six proteins have tentatively been assigned by comparison with the human heart 2-DE protein database of Jungblut et al. (Electrophoresis) 1994, 15, 685-607). This database is being used in studies of alterations in protein expression in the diseased and transplanted human heart.",
