  "abstract_text": "<h4>Aim</h4>To investigate the correlation between androgen receptor expression and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) mRNA levels.<h4>Methods</h4>39 human prostate cancers and 14 benign prostatic hypertrophy specimens were examined immunohistochemically for androgen receptor expression and by in situ hybridisation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for FGF8 expression.<h4>Results</h4>In 39 tumours there was a statistically significant negative correlation between tumour grade and FGF8 expression and a positive correlation between FGF8 and androgen receptor expression. All 14 benign hypertrophy specimens expressed moderate to high levels of FGF8 and androgen receptor.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Loss of FGF8 may be a factor involved in the development of prostatic cancer.",
