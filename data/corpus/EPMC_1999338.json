    "abstract_text": "We describe a simple method for characterizing a frequent polymorphism (that substitutes an arginine for a proline) in the coding sequence of the Tp53 gene in patients with colonic cancer and in a control population. We could find no evidence that this polymorphism is associated with a marked predisposition to colorectal cancer.",
