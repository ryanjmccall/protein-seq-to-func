    "abstract_text": "Recombinant bacterial plasmids that contain DNA complementary to human preproinsulin messenger RNA have been constructed. One clone contains the entire preproinsulin coding region, as well as the 3' untranslated region of the messenger RNA and eight nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region. Additional sequence information for the 5' untranslated region was obtained with the use of insulinoma messenger RNA in conjunction with specific primers from the cloned DNA for enzymatic chain termination sequence analysis. The results confirm the amino acid sequence of human proinsulin previously determined, and predict the amino acid sequence of the human preproinsulin signal peptide.",
