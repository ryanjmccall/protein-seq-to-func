  "abstract_text": "Thrombo-occlusive diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is recommended for the treatment of the maladies. However, both t-PA and u-PA are rapidly inactivated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Here, we show that longistatin, a novel plasminogen activator isolated from the ixodid tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis is resistant to PAI-1. Longistatin was relatively less susceptible to the inhibitory effect of SDS-treated platelet lysate than physiologic PAs. Platelet lysate inhibited t-PA and tcu-PA with the IC(50) of 7.7 and 9.1 μg/ml, respectively, whereas for longistatin inhibition IC(50) was 20.1 μg/ml (p<0.01). Similarly, activated PAI-1 (20 nM) inhibited only 21.47% activity of longistatin but almost completely inhibited t-PA (99.17%) and tcu-PA (96.84%). Interestingly, longistatin retained 76.73% initial activity even after 3h of incubation with 20 nM of PAI-1. IC(50) of PAI-1 during longistatin inhibition was 88.3 nM while it was 3.9 and 3.2 nM in t-PA and tcu-PA inhibition, respectively. Longistatin completely hydrolyzed fibrin clot by activating plasminogen efficiently in the presence of 20 nM of PAI-1. Importantly, unlike t-PA, longistatin did not form complex with PAI-1. Collectively, our results suggest that longistatin is resistant to PAI-1 and maybe an interesting tool for the development of a PAI-1 resistant effective thrombolytic agent.",
