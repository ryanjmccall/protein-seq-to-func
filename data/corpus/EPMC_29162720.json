  "abstract_text": "As a sensitive signaling system, the mitotic checkpoint ensures faithful chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase onset even when a single kinetochore is unattached to mitotic spindle microtubules. The key signal amplification reaction for the checkpoint is the conformational conversion of \"open\" mitotic arrest deficient 2 (O-MAD2) into \"closed\" MAD2 (C-MAD2). The reaction has been suggested to be catalyzed by an unusual catalyst, a MAD1:C-MAD2 tetramer, but how the catalysis is executed and regulated remains elusive. Here, we report that in addition to the well-characterized middle region of MAD1 containing the MAD2-interaction motif (MIM), both N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of MAD1 also contribute to mitotic checkpoint signaling. Unlike the MIM, which stably associated only with C-MAD2, the NTD and CTD in MAD1 surprisingly bound both O<i>-</i> and C-MAD2, suggesting that these two domains interact with both substrates and products of the O<i>-</i>to-C conversion. MAD1<sup>NTD</sup> and MAD1<sup>CTD</sup> also interacted with each other and with the MPS1 protein kinase, which phosphorylated both NTD and CTD. This phosphorylation decreased the NTD:CTD interaction and also CTD's interaction with MPS1. Of note, mutating the phosphorylation sites in the MAD1<sup>CTD</sup>, including Thr-716, compromised MAD2 binding and the checkpoint responses. We further noted that Ser-610 and Tyr-634 also contribute to the mitotic checkpoint signaling. Our results have uncovered that the MAD1<sup>NTD</sup> and MAD1<sup>CTD</sup> directly interact with each other and with MAD2 conformers and are regulated by MPS1 kinase, providing critical insights into mitotic checkpoint signaling.",
