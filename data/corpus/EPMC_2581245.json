    "abstract_text": "Six alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) cDNA clones were isolated from a human liver cDNA library by using synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. One of these, p alpha 2M1, carries a 4.6 kilobase-pair insert, which was sequenced. The insert contains the coding sequences for the mature alpha 2M polypeptide (1451 amino acids) and for a 23-amino acid signal peptide at the NH2 terminus of the precursor pro-alpha 2M. At the 3' end of the insert a poly(A) addition signal A-A-T-A-A-A and part of the poly(A) tail of the messenger RNA were found. The protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence agrees with the published alpha 2M amino acid sequence for all except three residues. The alpha 2M locus was assigned to human chromosome 12 by Southern blot analysis with DNA from a panel of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, using alpha 2M cDNA as a hybridization probe.",
