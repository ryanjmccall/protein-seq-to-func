  "abstract_text": "<h4>Background</h4>IGF1R gene mutations have been associated with varying degrees of intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, and microcephaly.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify and characterize IGF1R gene variations in a cohort of 28 Argentinean children suspected of having IGF-1 insensitivity, who were selected on the basis of the association of pre/postnatal growth failure and microcephaly.<h4>Methods</h4>The coding sequence and flanking intronic regions of IGF1R gene were amplified and directly sequenced. Functional characterization was performed by two in vitro assays: 1) [Methyl-(3) H] thymidine incorporation into DNA in fibroblast cell primary cultures from patients and controls treated with IGF-1 for 16-24 h. 2) PI3K/Akt pathway was evaluated with phospho-Akt (Ser473) STAR ELISA Kit (Millipore) in fibroblast cultures from patients and controls stimulated with IGF-1 for 10 min. Prepubertal clinical and GH-IGF-1 axis evaluation was followed up.<h4>Results</h4>We identified three novel heterozygous missense mutations in three unrelated patients, de novo p.Arg1256Ser, de novo p.Asn359Tyr and p.Tyr865Cys. In control cells, proliferation assay showed that IGF-1 significantly induced DNA synthesis at 20 h and Akt phosphorylation assay that it significantly stimulated phosphorylation after 10 min (P < 0·05 by anova and Bonferroni Tests). However, no significant increase was observed in any of the three patient fibroblasts in both functional studies. GH therapy growth response in two patients was inconsistent.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These variations led to failure of the IGF1R function causing pre- and postnatal growth retardation and microcephaly. Microcephaly should be considered in the evaluation of SGA patients, because it seems to favour the frequency of detection of IGF1R mutations.",
