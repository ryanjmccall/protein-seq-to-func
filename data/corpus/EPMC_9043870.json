  "abstract_text": "In contrast with the reported almost exclusive paternal origin of de novo mutations in MEN 2A, FMTC and MEN 2B, de novo mutations in Hirschsprung patients arise both on paternal and maternal chromosomes. This distinctive feature of RET mutations associated with Hirschsprung's disease and of the RET mutations associated with thyroid cancer indicates a basic biological difference between the mutational events leading to the different phenotypes.",
