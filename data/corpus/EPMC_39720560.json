OPEN-ACCESS TRUE Introduction Kufs disease (KD) is difficult to detect clinically and encompasses adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL) lacking retinal impairment. Clinically, patients with KD were classically dichotomized by those presenting with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (KSA) and those presenting with dementia and motor disturbances (KSB). 1 These clinical differentiations were subsequently bolstered by the identification of pathogenic DNAJC5 and CLN6 variants in predominantly KSA-presenting families and biallelic cathepsin-F ( CTSF ) variants in predominantly KSB-presenting families. 2 , 3 ,e1 Despite this, CLN6 variants have recently been associated with KSB and progressive myoclonic ataxia, and early cognitive, behavioral/neuropsychiatric, and/or movement disturbances preceding seizure onset have been noted in up to 25% of CLN6 carriers. 4 - 7 Concurrent reports associating biallelic CTSF variants with juvenile-onset disorders, KSA, and early-onset dementia have suggested that CLN13 phenotypes may be heterogeneous; however, the clinical spectrum of CLN13 has not been reviewed systematically. 8 - 11 ,e3 In this study, we describe mixed clinical features of KSA and KSB in an Indian patient who had autopsy-confirmed NCL and was homozygous for a CTSF indel. Then, we systematically review the clinicopathologic features of 19 additional patients reported in the literature with biallelic CTSF variants. Methods Clinical Presentation A 54-year-old woman of Indian descent presented at age 27 with EEG-confirmed tonic-clonic seizures and right head turning. The patient developed without issues and completed 2 master's degrees before symptom onset. Ten years from onset, she developed depression, social anxiety, and tested in the first percentile for executive control, word retrieval, memory, and verbal learning. Eleven years from onset, the patient developed left hemifacial spasms affecting the mouth and lips confirmed with electrophysiology. Neurologic examination revealed hypomimia, perseverations, ideomotor apraxia, dysarthria, horizontal saccadic breakdown, pronator drift, and hyperactive triceps. There were left upper extremity\u2013predominant movement disturbances including intermittent resting and action hand tremors, chorea, paratonia, myoclonic jerks, slowing of rapid alternating movements, dysmetria, and decreased arm swing. Twelve years from onset, she developed right-sided torticollis. Twenty-two years from onset, the patient developed frontal release signs, dysphagia, falls, right hand and foot dystonia, right upper extremity tremulousness, gait freezing, and festination and was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Family history included a maternal grandmother with late dementia and a distant paternal relative with schizophrenia ( Figure 1C ). Clinical genetic testing ruled out Huntington disease, Wilson disease, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy.

(A) Corpus callosum thinning (blue arrows) and moderate cerebellar vermis atrophy (purple shading). (B) Moderate bilateral cortical atrophy (yellow shading) and ventriculomegaly (green shading). (C) Pedigree of the proband (III-2); shaded symbols indicate affected individuals. (D) Cathepsin F protein (484 amino acids) labeled for functional domains and all reported CLN13-associated genetic variants (above = missense/intronic variants, below = nonsense/frameshift/copy number variants). SP = signal peptide. Neuropathologic Description Gross examination of the left hemibrain revealed frontal cortex atrophy, a diffusely thinned corpus callosum, and enlarged ventricles ( Figure 2 ). Microscopically, neurons and neurites throughout all cortices and the cerebellum had excessive diastase-resistant lipofuscin that was autofluorescent and immunoreactive with markers of lipofuscin (anti-HDFGL1) and early lysosomes (anti-LAMP1). Phosphorylated-tau (AT8) immunostains revealed a mild but widespread tau pathology affecting neurons, glia, and cell processes. Immunostains for other protein aggregates were negative. Postmortem genetic testing performed on DNA extracted from frozen brain revealed a homozygous CTSF indel variant (c.993_1004delinsTGCCTACT, p.K331Nfs*14). Figure 2 Neuropathologic Features of the Proband Key macroscopic features (A) included ventriculomegaly, a thinned corpus callosum (A; black arrows), and decreased locus ceruleus pigment (B; black arrow). Neuronal lipofuscin was autofluorescent (C) and positive with stains for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS; D), PAS with diastase (E), anti-HDGFL1 for lipofuscin (F), hematoxylin-eosin (H&E; G), Luxol fast blue (LFB; H), and anti-LAMP1 for early lysosomes (M, O; green arrowheads = lipofuscin accumulation). Lipofuscin accumulation was observed in neurites (F; green arrowheads), proximal axons (G; blue arrowhead), and proximal dendrites (E, F, H; red arrowheads). Immunostains for phosphorylated-tau (I, J, K, L) labeled neurons, cell processes, and glia. Fingerprint profiles were observed in a neuron with lipofuscin accumulation with electron microscopy (N). Review of CLN13 Disease We sought to better understand the clinical spectrum of CLN13 by reviewing the literature for individuals reported with biallelic CTSF variants and adequate clinical information, including the clinical presentation and age at onset, age at time of report, and an outline of the clinical course. 20 patients with CLN13 from 12 families (including the present patient) were selected for review ( Table ).

The mean age at onset was 34 years, and 14 of 20 patients were female. The earliest presentation was at age 11 (P16), and the latest presentation was at age 66 with tonic-clonic seizure (P6). 11 , 12 All patients with CLN13 ultimately developed cognitive impairment/dementia. Epilepsy was reported in 50% of patients, and 6 patients presented initially with seizures without cognitive impairment. Three of these patients were from the same family (P6\u2013P8). All patients who presented with facial dyskinesia had initial onset of seizures. The most frequent motor disturbances were tremors, extrapyramidal signs, and dysarthria (each 9/20). Zero patients presented with KSA, defined as progressive myoclonus epilepsy, neuropsychiatric change, cerebellar dysfunction, and late dementia with rare facial dyskinesias and pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs. Only 6 patients (P11, P13\u2013P15, P17, P19) presented with classical features of KSB, which we designated as KSB type I (KSB-I), defined as dementia with behavioral, neuropsychiatric, and movement disturbances without facial dyskinesia or seizures. Additional 6 patients (P1\u2013P4, P7, P18) presented with early seizures and features of classic KSB without myoclonus, which we classified as KSB type II (KSB-II). Four patients (P5, P6, P10, P20) presented with features of KSA and KSB and were classified as Kufs syndrome C (KSC), characterized by the presence of myoclonus epilepsy, dementia with movement disturbance, and rare facial dyskinesias. The remaining 3 patients (P8, P9, P12) presented with early-onset dementia, with behavioral disturbance noted in P8 and P12. Three patients (P11-P13) had unspecified motor speech problems and/or akinetic mutism, but it was not possible to attribute these signs to cerebellar or higher cortical dysfunction, given the available clinical information. Most CTSF variants were identified clinically, and NCL pathology was confirmed in 3 patients by autopsy and one patient by brain biopsy. Seven patients received skin biopsies, which were negative/nonspecific in 3 patients, while granular osmiophilic deposits in lipopigments were observed in the remaining 4 patients. Discussion We describe a 54-year-old Indian woman who presented with features of KSC and confirm the neuropathologic diagnosis of CLN13 disease by identifying a biallelic CTSF indel variant. In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinicopathologic features of 19 additional patients with CLN13 reported in the literature. In this review, we broadened the range of symptomatic onset in CLN13 to include juvenile-onset (6\u201315 years) and late adult-onset (>65 years). We also found that roughly twice as many female patients as male patients were reported with CLN13. Sex differences have been observed in other NCL diseases and NCL animal models. 14 Damaging biallelic CTSF were first identified in predominantly KSB-presenting families e1 ; however, we found that CLN13 phenotypes were heterogeneous, and most did not present with classic KSB (KSB-I). Surprisingly, half of the patients with CLN13 had epilepsy and 8 did not present with KSA or KSB, including 4 with KSC, 3 with early-onset dementia, and one with juvenile-onset retinal disturbance and cognitive impairment. CLN13 presentations varied between related and unrelated individuals with the same CTSF variants. Our patient and P18 were homozygous for the same CTSF indel but presented with KSB and KSC, respectively. 13 While our patient was Indian and P18 was reported in India, further studies are necessary to better understand the prevalence of the CTSF indel in India. Detecting ANCL clinically remains challenging, and skin biopsies proved unreliable in detecting CLN13 in 7 patients. Furthermore, CLN13 was confirmed by brain autopsy in just 3 patients. Therefore, we cannot determine whether CLN13 pathologic variability or other pathologies might explain the clinical heterogeneity in CLN13. Indeed, in a similar disorder, Gaucher disease, atypical clinical presentations have been associated with atypical pathologic features. 15 Because most patients with CLN13 were living when reported and CLN13 clinical presentations may evolve throughout the disease course, as we showed in our patient, our clinical observations may be limited. Previous detection of CTSF variants in clinical dementia cohorts has emphasized screening for CTSF variants in clinical settings. Improved detection of CLN13 may benefit from increased recognition of atypical clinical syndromes in CLN13. It is known that these syndromes overlap considerably (e.g., KSA and KSB), and continued examination of CLN13 is necessary to validate the value of these clinical findings.
