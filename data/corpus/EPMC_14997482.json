    "abstract_text": "Post-translational modifications of proteins from the human pituitary gland play an important role in the regulation of different body functions. We report on the application of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based approach to detect and characterize phosphorylated proteins in a whole human pituitary digest. By combining an immobilized metal affinity column-based enrichment method with MS/MS conditions that favor the neutral loss of phosphoric acid from a phosphorylated precursor ion, we identified several previously undescribed phosphorylated peptides. The identified peptides were matched to the sequences of six pituitary proteins: the human growth hormone, chromogranin A, secretogranin I, 60S ribosomal protein P1 and/or P2, DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 5, and galanin. The phosphorylation sites of these important regulatory proteins were determined by MS/MS and MS(3) analysis.",
