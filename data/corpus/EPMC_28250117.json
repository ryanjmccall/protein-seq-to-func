    "abstract_text": "Previous studies identified the nuclear domain 10 (ND10) components promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), hDaxx, and Sp100 as factors of an intrinsic immune response against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). This antiviral function of ND10, however, is antagonized by viral effector proteins like IE1p72, which induces dispersal of ND10. Furthermore, we have shown that both major immediate early proteins of HCMV, IE1p72 and IE2p86, transiently colocalize with ND10 subnuclear structures and undergo modification by the covalent attachment of SUMO. Since recent reports indicate that PML acts as a SUMO E3 ligase, we asked whether the SUMOylation of IE1p72 and IE2p86 is regulated by PML. To address this, PML-depleted fibroblasts, as well as cells overexpressing individual PML isoforms, were infected with HCMV. Western blot experiments revealed a clear correlation between the degree of IE1p72 SUMO conjugation and the abundance of PML. On the other hand, the SUMOylation of IE2p86 was not affected by PML. By performing <i>in vitro</i> SUMOylation assays, we were able to provide direct evidence that IE1p72 is a substrate for PML-mediated SUMOylation. Interestingly, disruption of the RING finger domain of PML, which is proposed to confer SUMO E3 ligase activity, abolished PML-induced SUMOylation of IE1p72. In contrast, IE1p72 was still efficiently SUMO modified by a SUMOylation-defective PML mutant, indicating that intact ND10 bodies are not necessary for this effect. Thus, this is the first report that the E3 ligase PML is capable of stimulating the SUMOylation of a viral protein which is supposed to serve as a cellular mechanism to compromise specific functions of IE1p72.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The major immediate early proteins of human cytomegalovirus, termed IE1p72 and IE2p86, have previously been shown to undergo posttranslational modification by covalent coupling to SUMO moieties at specific lysine residues. However, the enzymatic activities that are responsible for this modification have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the PML protein, which mediates an intrinsic immune response against HCMV, specifically serves as an E3 ligase for SUMO modification of IE1p72. Since SUMO modification of IE1p72 has previously been shown to interfere with STAT factor binding, thus compromising the interferon-antagonistic function of this viral effector protein, our finding highlights an additional mechanism through which PML is able to restrict viral infections.",
