  "abstract_text": "The checkpoint kinase ATM is centrally involved in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. However, the mechanism of ATM activation during genotoxic stress is only partially understood. Here we report a direct regulatory linkage between the protein serine-threonine phosphatase 5 (PP5) and ATM. PP5 interacts with ATM in a DNA-damage-inducible manner. Reduced expression of PP5 attenuated DNA-damage-induced activation of ATM. Expression of a catalytically inactive PP5 mutant inhibited the phosphorylation of ATM substrates and the autophosphorylation of ATM on Ser 1981, and caused an S-phase checkpoint defect in DNA-damaged cells. Together our findings indicate that PP5 plays an essential role in the activation and checkpoint signaling functions of ATM in cells that have suffered DNA double-strand breaks.",
