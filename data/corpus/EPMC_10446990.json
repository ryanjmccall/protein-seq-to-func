  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "We have cloned a gene, BDP, encoding a protein with homology to the retinoblastoma-binding proteins Rbp1 and Rbp2. It also has homology to DNA-binding proteins such as Bright, a B-cell-specific trans-activator, and the Drosophila melanogaster dead ringer gene product. Like MyoD, Bdp binds to the COOH-terminal region of pRb through its conserved region and to hypophosphorylated pRb. It also binds to the MAR of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. Thus Bdp may contribute to the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in differentiation and tissue-specific expression.",
