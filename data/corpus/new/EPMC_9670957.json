    "abstract_text": "The chemokines are a growing family of low m.w., 70- to 80-residue proinflammatory cytokines that operate by interacting with G protein-coupled receptors. Chemokines are involved in cell migration and in the activation of specific leukocyte subsets. Using the Mono Mac 1 monocytic cell line, we show that monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) triggers activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 pathway and CCR2 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Both Ca2+ mobilization and cell migration are blocked in Mono Mac 1 cells by tyrphostin B42, a specific JAK2 kinase inhibitor. Within seconds of MCP-1 activation, JAK2 phosphorylates CCR2 at the Tyr139 position and promotes JAK2/STAT3 complex association to the receptor. This MCP-1-initiated phosphorylation and association to JAK2 is also observed in CCR2B-transfected HEK293 cells. In contrast, when a CCR2B Tyr139Phe mutant is expressed in HEK293 cells, it is not phosphorylated in tyrosine and triggers neither JAK2/STAT3 activation nor Ca2+ mobilization in response to MCP-1. These results implicate the tyrosine kinase pathway in early chemokine signaling, suggesting a key role for this kinase in later events.",
