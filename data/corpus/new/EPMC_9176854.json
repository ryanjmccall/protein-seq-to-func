    "abstract_text": "Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a novel disease characterized by proteinuria, lipoprotein thrombi in the glomeruli, and increased concentration of plasma apolipoprotein (apo) E. It is believed that a genetic disorder of apo E may be present and associated with the disease. Three patients with LPG were examined in this study. The patients' DNA sequences were analyzed, and a nucleotide G to C point mutation in exon 4 of the apo E gene was confirmed in each patient. This missense mutation denotes amino acid substitution of the proline residue for arginine residue at position 145 of apo E. This variant (apo E Sendai) may cause a marked molecular conformational change of the apo E. These findings suggest that a novel variant is etiologically related to LPG.",
