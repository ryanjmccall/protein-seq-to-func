    "abstract_text": "WD (tryptophan-aspartic acid dipeptide)-repeat proteins play a central role in signal transduction cascades by co-ordinating the interaction of key signalling molecules. We identified a novel propeller-FYVE [domain identified in Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1p and EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1)] protein, ProF, which is expressed in various cell lines and tissues and consists of seven WD-repeats and a FYVE domain. WD-repeat proteins offer a platform for protein-protein interactions by folding into a seven-bladed propeller-like structure, while the FYVE domain binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate present mainly on intracellular membranes. The ProF protein partially co-localizes with EEA1 on vesicular structures and binds to the protein kinases Akt and PKCzeta/lambda (protein kinase Czeta/lambda) via its WD-repeat propeller. ProF interacts more strongly with the kinases after hormonal stimulation. Endogenously expressed ProF and the two kinases interact in brain and in the preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1, suggesting a role in secretory vesicular processes. In summary, we describe a new binding partner for kinases, located on vesicular structures in specialized cells, which may play a role for the spatial organization of signalling cascades.",
