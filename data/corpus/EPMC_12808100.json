  "abstract_text": "The regulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays an important role in the proliferative capacity and survival of cells. Here, we report that exogenously as well as endogenously induced oxidative stress leads to translocation of endogenous as well as overexpressed human TERT from the nucleus into the cytosol. TERT is transported through the nuclear pores in a leptomycin-sensitive and Ran GTPase-dependent process. H(2)O(2)-induced nuclear export of TERT is preceded by TERT tyrosine phosphorylation at position 707 and prevented by the Src kinase family inhibitor PP1. Oxidative stress-induced nuclear export of TERT depends on association with the Ran GTPase. In contrast, mutation of tyrosine 707 inhibits phosphorylation induced by oxidative stress and prevents association with Ran and nuclear export of TERT. Moreover, inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation at 707 increases the antiapoptotic capacity of TERT. Taken together, depletion of nuclear TERT by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export of TERT is a novel mechanism for regulation of TERT localization, which reduces the antiapoptotic activity of TERT.",
