    "abstract_text": "We previously showed that C2 myoblasts transformed by simian virus 40 large T antigen (SVLT) stop the myogenic process after the induction of myogenin and of high Rb levels; the induced Rb, however, becomes notably phosphorylated. We have analyzed the protein levels and activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) in untransformed C2 cells and in transformants of either SVLT or the cytoplasmic mutant NKT1 (which permits differentiation) upon a shift from growth medium (GM) to mitogen-poor differentiation medium (DM). After the shift, cdk4 levels remained constant and cdk6 levels decreased in all cell types; cdk2 minimally increased only in SVLT cells. Cyclin D1 was downregulated in DM in all cell types, and cyclin D3 was upregulated (albeit less strongly in SVLT cells than in the others). In contrast, a dramatic difference between SVLT cells and the other cells was observed for cyclins E and A, which essentially disappeared (as protein and RNA) in normal C2 and NKT1 cells upon the shift from GM to DM, whereas they increased in SVLT cells. Concurrently, cdk2 activity ceased in C2 and NKT1 cells in DM, whereas it persisted at 20% of the GM level in SVLT cells. cdk4 activity was detectable in all cells only in GM. Cyclin E and A induction thus appeared to sustain enough Rb phosphorylation to interfere with tissue-specific expression, with cdk activity not high enough to activate cyclin self-regulation. In DM, cdk2 complexed to D3 was underphosphorylated in all cells, and SVLT allowed strong inductions of p21 and p27 without affecting their complexes with cdks.",
