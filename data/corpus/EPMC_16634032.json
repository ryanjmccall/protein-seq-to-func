  "abstract_text": "<h4>Objective</h4>To define the molecular etiology of early-onset parkinsonism and peripheral neuropathy.<h4>Methods</h4>Two sisters had early-onset parkinsonism (dystonic toe curling, action tremor, masked face, bradykinesia, stooped posture, and rigidity), together with clinical and electrophysiological signs of sensorimotor axonal peripheral neuropathy.<h4>Results</h4>No mutations were found in the genes for parkin or PINK1. Muscle biopsies showed ragged-red and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers, and biochemistry showed decreased activities of respiratory chain complexes containing mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits. Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions were seen by long polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of the POLG gene showed that the patients were compound heterozygous for two patogenic mutations.<h4>Interpretation</h4>POLG mutations can cause early-onset parkinsonism in the absence of progressive external ophthalmoplegia.",
