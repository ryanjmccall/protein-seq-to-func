    "abstract_text": "A plasmid pUChEF-2 containing the coding sequence as well as the complete 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of human EF-2 mRNA was constructed. The plasmid construct was assembled from a cDNA insert of pHGR81 (Rapp et al., (1988) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 369, 247-250) comprising the C-terminal portion of the coding region and the 3'UTR, as well as a polymer chain reaction PCR fragment (Rapp et al., (1989) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 370, 1071-1075) covering the missing part of the coding region from the amino-terminus.",
