    "abstract_text": "Eukaryotic cells have evolved a mechanism that delays the progression of mitosis until condensed chromosomes are properly positioned on the mitotic spindle. To understand the molecular basis of such monitoring mechanism in human cells, we have been studying genes that regulate the mitotic checkpoint. Our early studies have led to the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding MAD3-like protein (also termed BUBR1/MAD3/SSK1). Dot blot analyses show that BUBR1 mRNA is expressed in tissues with a high mitotic index but not in differentiated tissues. Western blot analyses show that in asynchronous cells, BUBR1 protein primarily exhibits a molecular mass of 120 kDa, and its expression is detected in most cell lines examined. In addition, BUBR1 is present during various stages of the cell cycle. As cells enter later S and G2, BUBR1 levels are increased significantly. Nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells obtained by mechanical shake-off contain BUBR1 antigen with a slower mobility on denaturing SDS gels. Phosphatase treatment restores the slowly migrating band to the interphase state, indicating that the slow mobility of the BUBR1 antigen is attributable to phosphorylation. Furthermore, purified recombinant His6-BUBR1 is capable of autophosphorylation. Our studies indicate that BUBR1 phosphorylation status is regulated during spindle disruption. Considering its strong homology to BUB1 protein kinase, BUBR1 may also play an important role in mitotic checkpoint control by phosphorylation of a critical cellular component(s) of the mitotic checkpoint pathway.",
