CHK2 Olaparib DNA damage Triple negative breast cancer Therapeutic target INTRODUCTION Human breast cancer (BC) is relatively well treated, partly owing to the availability of targeted therapeutic options, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 90% in the United States ( Siegel et al ., 2024 ). The largest BC subtype expresses estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR), enabling the use of hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen. Another significant breast cancer subtype is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, which can be effectively treated with HER2-targeting antibodies such as trastuzumab. However, a substantial proportion of BC cases lack ER, PR, or HER2 expression and are classified as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is characterized by aggressive behavior and a lack of targeted therapeutic options other than chemotherapy and radiation, resulting in high recurrence rates and poor prognoses ( Aysola et al ., 2013 ). An enormous volume of research has been dedicated to finding better therapeutic options for TNBC over the past decades. Although most approaches have shown limited success, recent findings suggest that targeting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways could be a critical and effective strategy for treating TNBC in specific circumstances. The DDR system plays a crucial role in the detection, signaling, and repair of DNA lesions ( Huen and Chen, 2010 ). Key DDR kinases, including ATM, ATR, CHK1, and CHK2, are vital for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the maintenance of genomic stability. In response to DNA damage, these DDR kinases activate cell cycle checkpoints and recruit repair proteins, and when damage is irreparable, they initiate apoptosis ( Reinhardt and Yaffe, 2009 ). In TNBC, mutations or deficiencies in repair genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 are prevalent, creating vulnerabilities in cancer cell repair mechanisms. This presents a potential therapeutic opportunity through the concept of synthetic lethality, whereby the inhibition of one DDR pathway in a cell that is already deficient in another can selectively induce cell death in cancer cells while sparing normal cells ( Muvaffak and Coleman, 2024 ). However, the long-term maintenance use of poly (ADP‒ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors has raised significant clinical challenges that need to be addressed. CHK2, a central DDR kinase, plays a pivotal role in regulating cell cycle arrest and DNA repair pathways in response to DNA damage ( Zannini et al ., 2014 ). In TNBC, where BRCA1/2 deficiencies are prevalent, interest in targeting CHK2 has increased because of its involvement in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway ( Sofianidi et al ., 2024 ). The combination of CHK2 inhibition with PARP inhibitors (such as olaparib), which further inhibit single-strand break repair, has been demonstrated to significantly increase DNA damage accumulation, driving cancer cells toward apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that combining cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors with PARP inhibitors results in the synergistic induction of cell cycle arrest and DNA damage in cancer cells, potentially leading to significant improvements in treatment efficacy ( Barchiesi et al ., 2021 ; Li et al ., 2022 ). Herein, we report a new small-molecule compound that targets CHK2, representing a valuable addition to the arsenal of targeted therapies, particularly for cancers with high genomic instability. Through selective CHK2 inhibition and enhanced sensitivity to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, ART-446 offers a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy. This approach broadens treatment options for aggressive cancers such as TNBC and expands the impact of DDR-targeted therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and drugs MDA-MB-231, VERO, CHO-K1, L-929 (NCTC clone 929) cells were obtained from Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB, Seoul, Korea) and grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468 cells were acquired from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in Leibovitz’s L-15 media supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TRI-DR U2OS ( Khurana et al ., 2014 ) were gifted from Dr. Oberdoerffer and Dr. Stark ( Gunn and Stark, 2012 ) respectively and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific). All cell lines were passaged up to 10 times and tested for contamination using the e-Myco™ Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (iNtRON, Seongnam, Korea). ART-446 was synthesized by Arum Therapeutics (Seoul, Korea). AZD-7762, Prexasertib, and Olaparib were purchased from Selleck Chemicals LLC (Houston, TX, USA). Kinase selectivity ART-446 was tested against 671 kinases using a 33 P-radiolabeled assay at Reaction Biology Corp ( http://www.reactionbiology.com ). The compounds were tested at a single dose (1 μM) with 10 μM ATP in duplicate. The relative activity to DMSO treated control was measured. Kinome tree representations were prepared using Kinmap ( http://kinhub.org/kinmap/index.html ). For CHK2 kinase assay, ART-446 was tested in a 10-dose using a 3-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μM, with 10 μM ATP. Binding affinity ART-446 was tested against 468 kinase at a single dose (1 μM) using The KINOMEscan™ screening platform TREEspot™ at Eurofins DiscoverX (Fremont, CA, USA). The selectivity score (S-Score) was calculated as S-Score 10=(number of kinases with % control <10)/(total kinases tested). CHK1 and CHK2 binding affinity were measured by Eurofins DiscoverX, according to the KdELECT(R) protocol. The assay has three components: a kinase-tagged phage, a test compound, and an immobilized ligand that the compound competes with to displace the kinase. The amount of kinase bound to the immobilized ligand is determined using quantitative PCR of the DNA tag. ART-446 was tested in an 11-dose using a 3-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μM. Cell viability assay Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 3×10 3 /well and were cultured for 72 h in a media containing the drugs. Cell viability was determined by using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and measured by BioTek Synergy H1 Multimode Reader (Agilent, Winooski, VT, USA). Western blotting The cell lysates were suspended in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing Halt Protease inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), kept on ice for 1h to extract the total protein. The protein concentration in each sample was measured using BCA protein kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An equal amount of protein per sample (50 μg) was denatured at 80°C for 15 min, then loaded to the 10% SDS-PAGE. The electrophoresis process was performed at 60 V for 3 h, and separated proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). After 1h blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Affimetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against BRCA1 (Cell Signaling, #9010, Danvers, MA, USA), RAD51 (Cell Signaling, #8875), γH2AX (Cell Signaling, #7631), pCHK2 (Thr68 or Ser516) (Cell Signaling, #2661 or #2669), pCHK1 (Ser296) (Cell Signaling, #2349) or pCDC2 (Tyr15) (Cell Signaling, #9111) at 4°C overnight. The membrane was then washed thrice with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, #7074) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase solution. The immunocomplexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescent system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Blot images were captured using the Fujiflm LAS4000 mini (Fujiflm, Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of protein bands on the membranes was quantitatively determined by Gelquant software version 1.7.8 (Fisher scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). Cell cycle analysis Cancer cells were seeded in 12-well plates at densities of 1×10⁵ cells/well for Triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then treated with ART-446 in combination with Olaparib. At 72 h after treatments, the cells were washed thrice with cold PBS, and detached by trypsin 0.25%. They were next fixed with EtOH 66% overnight at 4°C. The following day, the fixed cells were incubated with RNAse A and PI solution in the Propidium iodide flow cytometry Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 30 min at 37°C. The fluorescent signal of PI was acquired by flow cytometry. The cell cycle analysis was performed in the Flowjo Ver. 7.6 software (BD, Ashland, OR, USA). The statistical analysis was obtained by GraphPad Prism software version 8.4.2 (GraphPad, Boston, MA, USA). Cell apoptosis Cancer cells were seeded in 12-well plates at densities of 1×10⁵ cells/well for Triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then treated with ART-446 in combination with Olaparib. After 72 h, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and detached using 0.25% trypsin. They were subsequently stained using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit with PI (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Flow cytometry was used to analyze PI signals in the PE panel, and the data were processed using FlowJo VX software. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2. HRR and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair assays For transient HR and NHEJ reporter system, a total of 3×10⁵ 293T cells were initially transfected with either the pDR-GFP and siRNA (control or RAD51) or pimEJ5-GFP and siRNA (control or DNA-PK) construct. After 24 h, the cells were further transfected with 3.5 μg of the I-SceI expression plasmid (pCBASce). Following an additional 48-h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed for GFP expression using flow cytometry. The results represent the mean values obtained from three independent experiments. For HR assay in the stable reporter system, a total of 0.4×10⁵ TRI-DR U2OS cells were initially treated with ART-446. After 24 h, I Sce-I expression was induced by adding 10 μg/ml doxycycline. Following an additional 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested and analyzed for GFP expression using flow cytometry. The results represent the mean values obtained from three independent experiments. For NHEJ assay in the stable reporter system, a total of 2×10⁵ EJ5-GFP U2OS cells were initially transfected with 1 μg of the I Sce-I expression plasmid (pCBASceI). After 4 h, the cells were further treated with ART-446. Following an additional 72-h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed for GFP expression using flow cytometry. The results represent the mean values obtained from three independent experiments. Xenografts studies The in vivo efficacy study was performed by Yeungnam University. All animal procedures were approved by Yeungnam University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For the efficacy study, MDA-MB-436 cells (3×10 6 in 100 μL PBS) were injected subcutaneously into female athymic nude mice. Twenty days after tumor implantation, when the tumor volume reached around 120 mm 3 , 40 mice with similar tumor volumes and body weight were selected from tumor-bearing mice, and randomly divided into four groups (denoted as day 1). Control, Olaparib (50 mg/kg), ART-446 (20 mg/kg), ART-446+Olaparib. For Olaparib or ART-446 treatment groups, mice were treated with Olaparib (p.o.) and ART-446 (p.o.) 5 days a week with 2 days off for 4 cycles for 28 days at a dose of 50 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. For ART-446+Olaparib treatment group, mice were treated with ART-446 (20 mg/kg, 5 days per week) followed by Olaparib (50 mg/kg, 5 days per week) after 1 h difference. For the mice of the control group, 10% HPβCD in PBS (p.o.) was administered on the same day as the treatment groups. Tumor volume and body weight were monitored until the completion of the study. Immunohistochemistry Histopathological changes in MDA-MB-436 TNBC xenografts treated with control, Olaparib (50 mg/kg), and ART-446 (20 mg/kg)+Olaparib (50 mg/kg) were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The primary antibodies anti-cleaved caspase-3 (#9661, Cell Signaling), anti-PARP (sc-23461, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-CD31 (550274, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), anti-CHK1 (Ser345) (LS-C358948, LSBio, Lynwood WA, USA), anti-CHK2 (Thr68) (#2197, Cell Signaling), anti-CDC2 (Tyr15) (Ap0016, ABclonal, Woburn, MA) (Ab16667, Abcam), Anti-H3 (Ser10) (AP0840, ABclonal) or anti- γH2AX (AP0687, ABclonal) were analyzed through avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex immunohistochemical staining. Tumor mass diameters, cell volumes, and percentage of immuno-detected cells were quantified using computer-based image analysis for statistical evaluation of changes across eight tumor fields per group. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was calculated using two-tailed unpaired Student t -test (for in vitro data), Two-way ANOVA with Holm–Sidak multiple comparison test (for xenograft studies) and Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (for immunohistochemistry data) by GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software). RESULTS ART-446 is a potent and selective CHK2 inhibitor To identify and optimize ART-446, the hinge interaction and piperidine moiety were initially preserved, while various functional groups were substituted on the phenyl ring, as shown in the lead compound hit Compound 1. Subsequently, modifications were made to the piperidine group to improve the physicochemical properties of the compound and optimize its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile ( Fig. 1A ). ART-446 was identified as a potent CHK2 inhibitor, with an IC 50 of 9.06 nM against CHK2 ( Fig. 1B ). In selectivity screens, ART-446 showed significantly lower inhibitory effects on unrelated protein kinases, exhibiting more than 10-fold kinase selectivity over CHK1, PLK1, cMER, MNK2, ROS/ROS1, MNK1, and DNA-PK ( Table 1 ). CHK2 autophosphorylates at Ser516 following initial phosphorylation at Thr68 by ATM kinase in response to DNA damage, and this phosphorylation is dependent on the kinase activity of CHK2 (Wu and Chen., 2003). A significant reduction in CHK2 Ser516 phosphorylation was observed in TNBC cells treated with ART-446, indicating the effective inhibition of CHK2 activity ( Fig. 1C ), followed by DNA damage. We subsequently evaluated the growth inhibition effect (GI50) of ART-446 across 45 different cancer cell lines to assess its broad-spectrum anticancer activity. Among them, the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 presented favorable GI50 values ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We then examined TNBC cell viability following treatment with increasing concentrations of ART-446. A dose‒response curve revealed potent CHK2 inhibition, highlighting the potential of this compound for high efficacy in TNBC treatment ( Fig. 1D ). Notably, ART-446 did not exhibit significant cytotoxic effects in three noncancer cell lines (VERO, CHO-K1, and L-929 cells). In contrast, the clinically developed CHK1 inhibitors AZD7762 (CHK1/2 inhibitor) ( Zabludoff et al ., 2008 ) and prexasertib (Chk1 inhibitor) ( Mani et al ., 2019 ) showed significant cytotoxic effects in these noncancerous cell lines. These findings suggest that ART-446 has a favorable safety profile and exhibits selective cytotoxicity toward TNBC cells while sparing noncancerous cells ( Fig. 1E ). Next, to assess the specificity and safety profile of ART-446, we screened it against a panel of 468 kinases (including 65 mutants) at 1 μM using KINOMEscan technology ( Fig. 2A , Supplementary Table 1 ). ART-446 exhibited high selectivity, with an S(10) score of 0.015, indicating minimal off-target activity. While CHK2WT was the primary target (8%), ART-446 also bound to five other kinases: IRAK3 (0%), DLK (0.8%), RIPK4 (3.2%), PI3K3CG (5.3%), and MKNK2 (7.7%). Notably, ART-446 demonstrated significantly greater affinity for CHK2 than for CHK1 (50%), as determined by binding constant (Kd) measurements. Dose‒response curve analysis further supported the high selectivity of ART-446 toward CHK2, as indicated by its more pronounced binding profile with CHK2 (Kd=120 nM) than with CHK1 (Kd=810 nM) ( Fig. 2B ). ART-446 was further tested at 1 μM against 671 human kinases using Kinase Profiling at Reaction Biology. A dot plot visualization was generated to represent the response of each kinase to ART-446, with red dots indicating strong inhibition (<20% activity). Notably, CHK2 (2.8%), cMER (7.4%), and TRKA (G667S) (15.1%) exhibited the strongest inhibition (blue dots, 20-50% activity), indicating moderate inhibition of other kinases. This mapping confirmed the selectivity profile of ART-446, highlighting that CHK2 is the primary target with minimal interaction across the wider kinome ( Fig. 2C , Supplementary Table 2 ). Together, these data underscore the potential of ART-446 as a highly selective CHK2 inhibitor. Its strong therapeutic implications for pathways involving CHK2, coupled with minimal off-target kinase interactions, position ART-446 as a promising therapeutic candidate for cancers with CHK2 dysregulation. ART-446 synergizes with the PARP inhibitor olaparib PARP inhibitors lead to the accumulation of DSBs, which activate CHK2. CHK2 subsequently halts the cell cycle and activates BRCA1 and PARP1 to facilitate DSB repair ( Lee et al ., 2000 ; Hsu et al ., 2019 ). To investigate the combined effect of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and the CHK2 inhibitor ART-446, we conducted experiments using the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-436, which harbors a homozygous missense mutation in BRCA1 ( Elstrodt et al ., 2006 ). Compared with either treatment alone, cotreatment of TNBC cells with varying concentrations of ART-446 and olaparib for 72 h resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability, demonstrating a robust synergistic effect ( Fig. 3A ). Interestingly, synergistic effects were observed in both BRCA mutant (MDA-MB-436) and BRCA wild-type (MDA-MB-231) cells (the combination indices are shown in Supplementary Table 3 ). To explore the molecular effects of this combination, we examined DDR markers in MDA-MB-436 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that ART-446 specifically inhibited CHK2 phosphorylation at Ser516. Notably, in combination with olaparib, ART-446 led to an increase in the DNA damage marker γH2AX and the apoptosis marker cleaved PARP1, indicating enhanced DDR pathway disruption. This increased DNA damage likely contributed to the enhanced apoptosis observed in TNBC cells treated with the combination therapy. These findings highlight the potential of combining CHK2 and PARP inhibitors to achieve enhanced therapeutic effects in TNBC, providing a promising strategy for targeting this aggressive cancer subtype ( Fig. 3B ). Combination treatments induce checkpoint cell cycle arrest and apoptosis To assess the combined effects of ART-446 and olaparib on the cell cycle in TNBC cells, we analyzed cell cycle progression and apoptosis using flow cytometry. After 72 h of continuous exposure, the combination treatment induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, highlighting its impact on cell cycle checkpoints ( Fig. 4A ). Annexin V staining revealed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells following the combination treatment ( Fig. 4B ). These findings suggest that ART-446, when combined with olaparib, effectively induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy in TNBC treatment, irrespective of the BRCA1 mutation status. ART-446 treatment impairs HRR and NHEJ repair activities To evaluate the impact of ART-446 on DSB repair, we assessed the efficiency of HR and NHEJ, the two primary cellular DSB repair pathways. HR efficiency was measured using DR-GFP, and NHEJ efficiency was assessed via the EJ5-GFP reporter system ( Fig. 5A ). ART-446 significantly reduced HR repair efficiency, as evidenced by the lower number of GFP-positive cells than control cells. Similarly, ART-446 treatment markedly decreased NHEJ repair efficiency, further confirming its inhibitory effect on DSB repair ( Fig. 5B ). Additionally, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in HR and NHEJ efficiency in a stable cell line system ( Fig. 5C ). These results collectively show that ART-446 effectively impairs DSB repair, potentially enhancing its therapeutic efficacy by directly disrupting DNA repair mechanisms. BRCA2 loss sensitizes cells to ART-446 via increased DNA damage The aforementioned findings suggest that ART-446 exacerbates DNA damage by suppressing DSB repair, thereby increasing its therapeutic efficacy and highlighting the potential of ART-446 to increase DNA damage accumulation and impair repair pathways in BRCA2-deficient cells. The loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 is a well-established biomarker for PARP inhibitor sensitivity in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers ( Li and Zou, 2024 ); this is based on the rationale that PARP inhibitors exploit synthetic lethality to selectively kill cancer cells. As expected, compared with wild-type (WT) cells, BRCA2 knockout (KO) DLD-1 cells exhibited dramatically increased sensitivity to olaparib. Similarly, BRCA2 loss increased sensitivity to ART-446 treatment by approximately 1000-fold ( Fig. 6A ). Mechanistically, compared with WT cells, BRCA2 KO cells exhibited enhanced CHK2 phosphorylation (Ser516) inhibition at lower concentrations of ART-446; this inhibition was associated with elevated levels of DNA damage markers, such as γH2AX ( Fig. 6B ). Synergistic antitumor effects of ART-446 and olaparib in TNBC in vivo The antitumor efficacy of ART-446 in combination with olaparib was evaluated in vivo using MDA-MB-436 xenografts. Compared with either agent alone, the combination treatment significantly reduced tumor growth ( Fig. 7A , left) without causing significant adverse effects on body weight ( Fig. 7A , right). The combination treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of CHK1, CHK2, and CDC; reduced cell proliferation (Ki-67 and pH3), and increased both DNA damage (γH2AX) and cell death (cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP) ( Fig. 7B , Supplementary Fig. 2 ). These results demonstrate the synergistic therapeutic efficacy of combining olaparib and ART-446, supporting their potential as effective treatment strategies for TNBC. DISCUSSION DNA damage response (DDR) pathways and CHK2 as a therapeutic target DDR pathways are crucial for maintaining genomic stability by detecting, signaling, and repairing DNA lesions, particularly DSBs, which pose a significant threat to cell viability. In recent years, targeting DDR kinases has emerged as an attractive strategy in cancer therapy, as it exploits synthetic lethality in cancer cells with preexisting deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms ( Bartek, 2011 ; Lord et al ., 2015 ; Li et al ., 2023 ). Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) play critical roles in the DDR . Several CHK1 inhibitors in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents are currently under clinical evaluation ( Huang et al ., 2024 ). CHK2 is phosphorylated by ATM at Ser516 following DNA damage, initiating downstream responses that prevent cell cycle progression until repair is complete ( Bartek and Lukas, 2003 ; Smith et al ., 2010). This activation also promotes DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, the inhibition of CHK2 could lead to the accumulation of DNA damage, ultimately inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. CHK2 is essential for regulating the cell cycle and activating repair pathways in the DDR, particularly in response to chemotherapy or the intrinsic genomic instability of cancer cells. However, no CHK2 inhibitors have successfully advanced to higher stages of clinical development. Interestingly, CHK2 overactivation has been shown to be associated with the progression of various cancers, including aggressive subtypes such as TNBC, which lack targeted therapies and exhibit poor prognoses ( Sofianidi et al ., 2024 ). Identification and selectivity of ART-446 as a CHK2 inhibitor In this study, we report the discovery of ART-446, a novel and highly selective CHK2 inhibitor. ART-446 was developed with optimized physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic properties to enhance its therapeutic potential (data not shown). Biochemical screening demonstrated that ART-446 exhibits strong selectivity for CHK2 with minimal off-target effects on other kinases. Specifically, ART-446 potently inhibits CHK2 activity, as evidenced by its high binding affinity and selective inhibition of CHK2 phosphorylation at Ser516. These findings suggest that ART-446 selectively disrupts CHK2-mediated signaling pathways, enhances DNA damage, and sensitizes cancer cells to additional therapeutic agents. Targeting DDR pathways in BRCA-mutant and -resistant cancers Recent studies highlight the relevance of targeting the DDR in cancers with specific genetic mutations, such as BRCA1/2 mutations, which impair HR, a critical DNA repair pathway. This vulnerability has driven the development of synthetic lethality-based treatments, where the inhibition of another DDR component, such as PARP, selectively induces cancer cell death ( Dilmac and Ozpolat, 2023 ). PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, exploit synthetic lethality by blocking alternative DNA repair pathways, thereby causing DNA damage and inducing cell death in HR-deficient tumors ( Hu et al ., 2024 ). However, the long-term use of PARP inhibitors as maintenance therapy often leads to acquired resistance, even in BRCA1/2-mutant cancers. Resistance mechanisms include the reactivation of HR repair and other unknown pathways ( Jain et al ., 2025 ). The development of new strategies to targ et al ternative DDR pathways or overcome resistance mechanisms is critical for increasing treatment efficacy and preventing the recurrence of BRCA-mutant cancers. ART-446 and olaparib: a synergistic strategy In this study, we demonstrated that combining the CHK2 inhibitor ART-446 with the PARP inhibitor olaparib represents a promising strategy for maximizing therapeutic efficacy in cancers with DNA repair deficiencies. ART-446 alone disrupts both the HR and NHEJ pathways of DNA DSB repair. When combined with PARP inhibition, ART-446 further impairs DSB repair, leading to synergistic reductions in cell viability in both BRCA wild-type and BRCA-deficient TNBC cells. In vivo experiments using MDA-MB-436 xenografts revealed that the combination of ART-446 and olaparib significantly reduced tumor growth by exacerbating DNA damage and promoting apoptosis. Notably, the loss of BRCA2 sensitized cells to ART-446, demonstrates that the PARP inhibitor and ART-446 may act on overlapping DDR pathways. Implications of ART-446 for overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance This study elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the selective inhibition of CHK2 by ART-446, the impact of ART-446 on DNA damage and repair pathways, and the synergistic potential of ART-446 with olaparib. By inhibiting CHK2, ART-446 disrupts DSB repair, enhances DNA damage accumulation, and increases therapeutic efficacy, regardless of the BRCA mutation status. Our findings underscore the potential of ART-446 as a combination therapy aimed at maximizing DNA damage and minimizing repair. Importantly, ART-446 may help overcome resistance to long-term PARP inhibitor treatment, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC and other cancers with DNA repair deficiencies.

  "plain_text": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer subtype lacking targeted therapies and is characterized by high recurrence rates and poor prognosis. Recent advances in targeting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways using poly (ADP‒ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors offer promising therapeutic strategies, especially for TNBC patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. This study reports the development and characterization of ART-446, a novel and selective CHK2 inhibitor. ART-446 showed potent activity against TNBC, regardless of BRCA deficiency, and it also reversed PARP inhibitor resistance. ART-446 potently inhibited CHK2 (IC50: 9.06 nM) with high selectivity over other kinases; it synergized with the PARP inhibitor olaparib, enhancing DNA damage, inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest, and promoting apoptosis in both BRCA-mutant and wild-type TNBC cells. Mechanistic analyses revealed that ART-446 sensitized BRCA mutant and WT cells to PARP inhibitors by impairing DNA repair and increasing the accumulation of DNA damage. Importantly, ART-446 disrupted both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining repair pathways, addressing a key limitation of PARP inhibitor monotherapy—resistance in BRCA-proficient cancers. In vivo , the combination of ART-446 and olaparib significantly reduced tumor growth in TNBC xenograft models without noticeable toxicity. The combined treatment increased DNA damage signaling, as evidenced by elevated γH2AX levels, and enhanced the sensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells to ART-446. These findings underscore the potential of ART-446 to exploit DNA repair deficiencies and overcome resistance mechanisms associated with PARP inhibitors. By addressing the limitations of current treatments and expanding the utility of PARP inhibitors, ART-446 represents a promising candidate for DDR-targeted therapies, offering a novel approach to improve the outcomes of patients with TNBC."
