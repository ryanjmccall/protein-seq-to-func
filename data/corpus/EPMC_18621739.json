    "abstract_text": "PML is a potent tumor suppressor and proapoptotic factor and is functionally regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a promising class of targeted anticancer agents and induce apoptosis in cancer cells by largely unknown mechanisms. We report here a novel post-transcriptional modification, acetylation, of PML. PML exists as an acetylated protein in HeLa cells, and its acetylation is enhanced by coexpression of p300 or treatment with a HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. Increased PML acetylation is associated with increased sumoylation of PML in vitro and in vivo. PML is involved in trichostatin A-induced apoptosis and PML with an acetylation-defective mutation shows an inability to mediate apoptosis, suggesting the importance of PML acetylation. Our work provides new insights into PML regulation by post-translational modification and new information about the therapeutic mechanism of HDAC inhibitors.",
