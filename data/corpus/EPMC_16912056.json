  "abstract_text": "Several hormones that regulate nutritional status also impact on bone metabolism. Preptin is a recently isolated 34-amino acid peptide hormone that is cosecreted with insulin and amylin from the pancreatic beta-cells. Preptin corresponds to Asp(69)-Leu(102) of pro-IGF-II. Increased circulating levels of a pro-IGF-II peptide complexed with IGF-binding protein-2 have been implicated in the high bone mass phenotype observed in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. We have assessed preptin's activities on bone. Preptin dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation (cell number and DNA synthesis) of primary fetal rat osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cell lines at periphysiological concentrations (>10(-11) M). In addition, thymidine incorporation was stimulated in murine neonatal calvarial organ culture, likely reflecting the proliferation of cells from the osteoblast lineage. Preptin did not affect bone resorption in this model. Preptin induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAP kinases in osteoblastic cells in a dose-dependent manner (10(-8)-10(-10) M), and its proliferative effects on primary osteoblasts were blocked by MAP kinase kinase inhibitors. Preptin also reduced osteoblast apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, reducing the number of apoptotic cells by >20%. In vivo administration of preptin increased bone area and mineralizing surface in adult mice. These data demonstrate that preptin, which is cosecreted from the pancreatic beta-cell with amylin and insulin, is anabolic to bone and may contribute to the preservation of bone mass observed in hyperinsulinemic states such as obesity.",
