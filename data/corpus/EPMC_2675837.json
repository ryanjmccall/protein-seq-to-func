  "abstract_text": "To better understand the processing of the Alzheimer disease amyloid precursor protein, we have cloned and sequenced that region of the human genome coding for the amyloid peptide. Two exons separated by a 6.2kb intron define this region. Characterization of the A4 peptide amino acid sequence shows similarity to the structure of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz). Our observation describes a different region of PreA4 than the previously characterized domain of larger amyloid precursor molecules PreA4 751 and 770(2). Moreover, the exon organization, Kunitz domain duplication and transmembrane location of A4 suggest that PreA4 is similar to growth factor precursors and thus may be processed similarly.",
