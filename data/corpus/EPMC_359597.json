    "abstract_text": "This work addressed the problem of heterogeneity of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) in human plasma. Subjects with normal glucose tolerance were given 75g of an oral glucose solution, followed in 30 min by an intravenous infusion of 30g of arginine over 30 min. At the end of the infusion blood was withdrawn for analysis. IRI was extracted from plasma of individual subject by immunosorbent columns and was fractionated by gel filtration, disc gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Human IRI components were identified by molecular size, immunoreactivity with a human proinsulin antibody, sensitivity to trypsin, and by comparison of electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric point with porcine pancreatic products, after suitable correction for electric charge and molecular weight differences. The pattern of IRI heterogeneity was the same among six healthy subjects. Heterogeneity of proinsulin-size IRI in circulation was more marked than that of insulin-size material. Proinsulin and desdipeptide proinsulin were present in approximately equal amounts accompanied by minor amounts of split proinsulin and monodesamido-desdipeptide proinsulin. Insulin-size IRI contained over 80% insulin. Minor amounts of monodesamidoinsulin and diarginylinsulin were observed in some cases. The types of IRI components observed in plasma are evidence in support of a physiologic role of trypsin-and carboxypeptidase B-like enzymes in the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Moreover, this study provides a base line for investigation of abnormalities in proinsulin-to-insulin conversion that may be associated with certain pathologic states.",
