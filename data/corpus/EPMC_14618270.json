    "abstract_text": "Although olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are used to promote repair in the injured spinal cord, little is known of their phenotype in this environment. In this study, using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR, expression of neuregulin-1 mitogen/survival factors and the axonal growth regulator Nogo was quantified in OECs and compared with other non-neuronal cells. Their expression was also compared with OECs which had previously been encapsulated in a porous polymer tube and implanted into the injured spinal cord. Similar to astrocytes and fibroblasts, OECs expressed various neuregulin subtypes including neu differentiation factor, glial growth factor and sensory and motorneuron-derived factor. Implanted OECs upregulated neu differentiation factor and secreted neuregulin, but downregulated expression of all other variants. OECs and oligodendrocytes expressed Nogo-A, -B and -ABC and were immunopositive for Nogo-A protein. The Nogo-A protein in OECs was found to be cytoplasmic rather than nuclear or cell surface associated. Unlike oligodendrocytes, OECs expressed Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) mRNA. Implanted OECs upregulated Nogo-A and -B, but downregulated Nogo-ABC and NgR.",
