  "abstract_text": "The extremely high cancer incidence associated with patients suffering from a rare human genetic disease, Fanconi anemia (FA), demonstrates the importance of FA genes. Over the course of human tumor development, FA genes perform critical tumor-suppression roles. In doing so, FA provides researchers with a unique genetic model system to study cancer etiology. Here, we review how aberrant function of the 22 FA genes and their signaling network contributes to malignancy. From this perspective, we will also discuss how the knowledge discovered from FA research serves basic and translational cancer research.",
