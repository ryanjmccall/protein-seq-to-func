    "abstract_text": "Aspirin exerts anti-thrombotic action by acetylating and inactivating cyclooxygenase-1, preventing the production of thromboxane A2 in platelets. Through this inhibition of platelet function, aspirin is considered as a preventative of ischemic diseases such as coronary and cerebral infarction. However, many studies have revealed that aspirin has other beneficial actions in addition to its anti-platelet activity. For example, aspirin may confer some benefit against colorectal cancer. Here, we discuss the involvement of inflammation in atherosclerosis and how aspirin exerts its beneficial actions in atherosclerotic diseases and cancer.",
