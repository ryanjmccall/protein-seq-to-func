    "abstract_text": "Gastrointestinal epithelium faces osmotic stress, both at physiological and pathophysiological conditions. JNK activation is an immediate cellular response to osmotic stress. We investigated the effect of osmotic stress on intestinal epithelial barrier function and delineated the role of JNK2 in osmotic stress-induced tight junction (TJ) regulation in Caco-2 cell monolayers and ileum of Jnk(-/-) and Jnk2(-/-) mice. The role of JNK activation in osmotic stress-induced TJ disruption was evaluated using JNK-specific inhibitor and antisense oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the effect of cold restraint stress in vivo on TJ integrity was determined in rats. Osmotic stress disrupted TJs and barrier function in Caco-2 cell monolayers without affecting cell viability. Osmotic stress activated JNK1 and JNK2 and the inhibition of JNK by SP600125 attenuated osmotic stress-induced TJ disruption. TJ disruption and barrier dysfunction by osmotic stress was associated with JNK-dependent remodeling of actin cytoskeleton. Knockdown of JNK2 accelerated TJ assembly and attenuated osmotic stress-induced TJ disruption in Caco-2 cell monolayers. In mouse ileum in vitro, osmotic stress increased paracellular permeability, which was attenuated by SP600125. Osmotic stress disrupted actin cytoskeleton and TJs and increased paracellular permeability in the ileum of wild-type and JNK1(-/-) mice, but not in JNK2(-/-) mouse ileum. Cold restraint stress activated JNK in rat ileum and caused JNK-dependent remodeling of actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of occludin and zona occluden-1 from the intercellular junctions. These results reveal the role of JNK2 in the mechanism of osmotic stress-induced TJ disruption in the intestinal epithelium.",
