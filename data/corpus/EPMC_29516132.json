    "full_text_abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 34-kDa glycoprotein that is secreted from many cells throughout the body. ApoE is best known for its role in lipoprotein metabolism. Recent studies underline the association of circulating lipoprotein-associated apoE levels and the development for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Besides its well-established role in pathology of CVD, it is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and recent new data on adipose-produced apoE point to a novel metabolic role for apoE in obesity. The regulation of apoE production and secretion is remarkably cell and tissue specific. Here, we summarize recent insights into the differential regulation apoE production and secretion by hepatocytes, monocytes/macrophages, adipocytes, and the central nervous system and relevant variations in apoE biochemistry and function.",
