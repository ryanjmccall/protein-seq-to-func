    "abstract_text": "Mononuclear phagocytes provide the major habitat of intracellular bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis. The capacity of B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (interleukin-6 [IL-6]) to activate tuberculostatic functions was investigated by using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM phi). BMM phi stimulated with recombinant IL-6 and subsequently infected with M. bovis organisms failed to inhibit mycobacterial growth. In contrast, marked tuberculostasis was induced by IL-6 in BMM phi that were already infected with M. bovis, indicating that IL-6 has a macrophage-activating function.",
