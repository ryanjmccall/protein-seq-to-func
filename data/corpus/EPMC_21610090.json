  "abstract_text": "The transmembrane inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein Samp1 is required for anchoring centrosomes near the nuclei. Using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy we show that Samp1 is distributed in a distinct and characteristic pattern in the nuclear envelope (NE), where it partially colocalizes with the LINC complex protein Sun1. By studying the localization of Samp1 deletion mutants and fusion proteins, we conclude that the cysteine-rich N-terminal half of Samp1 is nucleoplasmically exposed and is responsible for targeting to the INM. It contains four conserved CxxC motifs with the potential to form zinc fingers. The distribution of cysteine-to-alanine substitution mutants, designed to prevent zinc finger formation, showed that NE localization of Samp1 depends on intact CxxC motifs. Overexpression of Samp1 zinc finger mutants produced an abnormal dominant phenotype characterized by disrupted organization of a selective subset NE proteins, including emerin, Sun1, endogenous Samp1 and, in some cases, lamin A/C, but not lamin B, Sun2 or nucleoporins. Silencing of Samp1 expression showed that emerin depends on Samp1 for its correct localization in the NE. Our results demonstrate that Samp1 is functionally associated with the LINC complex protein Sun1 and proteins of the A-type lamina network.",
