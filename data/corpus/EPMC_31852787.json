  "abstract_text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a newly identified phlebovirus associated with severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. While many viruses subvert the host cell cycle to promote viral growth, it is unknown whether this is a strategy employed by SFTSV. In this study, we investigated how SFTSV manipulates the cell cycle and the effect of the host cell cycle on SFTSV replication. Our results suggest that cells arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition following infection with SFTSV. The accumulation of cells at the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition did not affect virus adsorption and entry but did facilitate viral replication. In addition, we found that SFTSV NSs, a nonstructural protein that forms viroplasm-like structures in the cytoplasm of infected cells and promotes virulence by modulating the interferon response, induces a large number of cells to arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition by interacting with CDK1. The interaction between NSs and CDK1, which is inclusion body dependent, inhibits formation and nuclear import of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex, thereby leading to cell cycle arrest. Expression of a CDK1 loss-of-function mutant reversed the inhibitive effect of NSs on the cell cycle, suggesting that this protein is a potential antiviral target. Our study provides new insight into the role of a specific viral protein in SFTSV replication, indicating that NSs induces G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest of SFTSV-infected cells, which promotes viral replication.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne pathogen that causes severe hemorrhagic fever. Although SFTSV poses a serious threat to public health and was recently isolated, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In particular, the relationship between SFTSV infection and the host cell cycle has not been described. Here, we show for the first time that both asynchronized and synchronized SFTSV-susceptible cells arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint following SFTSV infection and that the accumulation of cells at this checkpoint facilitates viral replication. We also identify a key mechanism underlying SFTSV-induced G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest, in which SFTSV NSs interacts with CDK1 to inhibit formation and nuclear import of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex, thus preventing it from regulating cell cycle progression. Our study highlights the key role that NSs plays in SFTSV-induced G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest.",
