    "abstract_text": "In the early 1990s, the search for protein kinases led to the discovery of a novel family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, the Janus kinases or JAKs. These proteins were unusual because they contained two kinase homology domains and no other known signaling modules. It soon became clear that these were not 'just another' type of kinase. Their ability to complement mutant cells insensitive to interferons and to be activated by a variety of cytokines demonstrated their central signaling function. Now, as we approach the end of the decade, it is evident from biochemical studies to knockout mice that JAKs play non-redundant functions in development, differentiation, and host defense mechanisms. Here, recent progress is reviewed, with particular emphasis on structure-function studies aimed at revealing how this family of tyrosine kinases is regulated.",
