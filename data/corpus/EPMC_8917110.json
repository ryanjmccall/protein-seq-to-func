  "title": "Alternate splice-site utilization in the gene for the catalytic subunit of the DNA-activated protein kinase, DNA-PKcs.",
  "year": 1996,

  "abstract_text": "Analysis of polyA-selected RNAs and cDNA clones from several human cell lines revealed the presence of a 93-bp exon in the PI kinase homology region of DNA-PKcs that was not present in the cDNA sequence derived from HeLa cell cDNA clones. RT-PCR showed that most DNA-PKcs mRNAs in human cells have this exon. Thus, the nascent DNA-PKcs polypeptide is composed of 4127 aa and has a predicted mol. wt. of 469021 (470 kDa).",
