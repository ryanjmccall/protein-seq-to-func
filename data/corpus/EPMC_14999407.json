  "abstract_text": "Using a search engine called Motifer, we searched the public database of the human genome for genes matching a consensus pattern of cysteine residues derived from members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. We identified two genes (named MDF451 and MDF628) that display sequence similarity to members of the TGF-beta superfamily in the arrangement of six conserved cysteine residues. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that MDF451 and MDF628 constitute a distinct subgroup within the TGF-beta superfamily, distantly related to the GDNF subfamily of ligands. Both genes could be identified in several primate species in addition to human, including chimpanzee, gorilla, guereza, and green and gray monkey, but not in rodents or other non-primate mammals, and appear not to be present in the genomes of mouse, rat or zebrafish. RNAs for MDF451 and MDF628 were expressed at low levels within distinct regions of the human central nervous system, including adult cerebellum, adult spinal cord and fetal brain. Despite expression at the RNA level, both genes presented a transcribed upstream stop codon that would prevent translation of the TGF-beta-like reading frame. The coding potential of alternative reading frames was not immediately apparent. The two genes may represent TGF-beta-like pseudogenes that have recently appeared in evolution in a common ancestor of the primate lineage by duplication from a GDNF/TGF-beta-like ancestral gene.",
