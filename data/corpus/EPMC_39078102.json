    "abstract_text": "<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), and to understand the genotype/phenotype correlation of structural variants (SVs) in the LMNB1 locus.<h4>Background</h4>Since the discovery of 3D genome architectures and topologically associating domains (TADs), new pathomechanisms have been postulated for SVs, regardless of gene dosage changes. ADLD is a rare genetic disease associated with duplications (classical ADLD) or noncoding deletions (atypical ADLD) in the LMNB1 locus.<h4>Methods</h4>High-throughput chromosome conformation capture, RNA sequencing, histopathological analyses of postmortem brain tissues, and clinical and neuroradiological investigations were performed.<h4>Results</h4>We collected data from >20 families worldwide carrying SVs in the LMNB1 locus and reported strong clinical variability, even among patients carrying duplications of the entire LMNB1 gene, ranging from classical and atypical ADLD to asymptomatic carriers. We showed that patients with classic ADLD always carried intra-TAD duplications, resulting in a simple gene dose gain. Atypical ADLD was caused by LMNB1 forebrain-specific misexpression due to inter-TAD deletions or duplications. The inter-TAD duplication, which extends centromerically and crosses the 2 TAD boundaries, did not cause ADLD. Our results provide evidence that astrocytes are key players in ADLD pathology.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Our study sheds light on the 3D genome and TAD structural changes associated with SVs in the LMNB1 locus, and shows that a duplication encompassing LMNB1 is not sufficient per se to diagnose ADLD, thereby strongly affecting genetic counseling. Our study supports breaking TADs as an emerging pathogenic mechanism that should be considered when studying brain diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:855-870.",
