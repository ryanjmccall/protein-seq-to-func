  "abstract_text": "We report the clinical and cytogenetic findings in a family in which a balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosome 4 and the short arm of chromosome 5 is segregating together with Huntington disease in 2 generations. In situ hybridization studies revealed that the linked human DNA marker is located on the short arm of the normal and translocated chromosome 4 in the region 4p16. The association between Huntington disease and the translocation in this family may represent a chance occurrence. However, it is also possible that there is an undetected rearrangement of DNA on chromosome 4 involving the gene for Huntington disease but not affecting the site of the linked marker. Finally, the likelihood that this represents heterogeneity cannot be excluded.",
