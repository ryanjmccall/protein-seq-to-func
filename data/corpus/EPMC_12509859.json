  "abstract_text": "We report a novel mutation of tau (L266V missense mutation in exon 9) which may cause a type of familial frontotemporal dementia. The brain of a patient showed Pick body-like inclusions and unique tau-positive, argyrophilic astrocytes with stout filaments and naked, round, or irregular argyrophilic inclusions with deposits of both three-repeat and four-repeat tau. Recombinant tau with a L266V mutation showed a reduced ability to promote microtubule assembly, which may be the primary effect of the mutation.",
