    "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) regulates growth of the brain. In order to characterize the variant IGF-1 present in human fetal brain we have determined the cDNA sequence for human fetal brain IGF-1. Using PCR to amplify cDNA obtained from isolated human fetal brain mRNA, two cDNA sequences encoding precursor proteins which correspond to IGF-1a and IGF-1b were obtained. This is the first characterisation of IGF-1 and its IGF-1a and IGF-1b precursors in the nervous system.",
