    "abstract_text": "<h4>Introduction</h4>The aim of this study is to describe a new mutation in the LMNA gene diagnosed by whole exome sequencing.<h4>Methods</h4>A two-generation kindred with recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy was evaluated by exome sequencing of the proband's DNA.<h4>Results</h4>Exome sequencing disclosed 194,618 variants (170,196 SNPs, 8482 MNPs, 7466 insertions, 8307 deletions, and 167 mixed combinations); 71,328 were homozygotic and 123,290 were heterozygotic, with 11,753 non-synonymous, stop-gain, stop-loss, or frameshift mutations occurring in the coding region or nearby intronic region. The cross-referencing of these mutations in candidate genes for muscular dystrophy showed a homozygote mutation c.G674A in exon 4 of LMNA causing a protein change R225Q in an arginine conserved from human to Xenopus tropicalis and in lamin B1.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This technique will be preferred for studying patients with muscular dystrophy in the coming years.",
