Keywords Endometrial cancer JAK2 HIF-1\u03b1 Inactivating mutations http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 National Natural Science Foundation of China 81702546 Chen Zheng issue-copyright-statement \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2024 Introduction Endometrial cancer (EC) is the ninth most common malignancy among women in China and is the fifth most common malignancy among women in the United States [ 1 ]. Previous studies that integrated whole-genome sequencing, exome sequencing, MSI assays, copy number analyses and proteomics have classified endometrial cancers into 4 clusters [ 2 ]. Rather than treating all disparate histologic types as one disease, modern clinical treatments seek to target biologic subsets. The JAK-STAT pathway involves diverse cytokines (IL-6 and IL-2 families), interferons, growth factors and related molecules in tumor, stromal and immune cells [ 3 ]. JAK2, a member of the JAK family of kinases, has emerged as an important target in many types of solid tumors. The JAK2/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and progression of various cancer [ 4 ], including pancreatic cancer [ 5 ], breast cancer [ 6 ], gastric cancer [ 7 ], ovarian cancer [ 8 ], liver cancer [ 9 ], colorectal cancer [ 10 ], and thyroid cancer[ 11 ]. The clinical relevance and biological functional impact of JAK2 in EC is poorly understood. In this study, JAK2 is frequently mutated and down-regulated in EC. JAK2 inactivation enhanced the proliferation and migration of EC cells via aberrant activation of the HIF-1\u03b1 pathway. Taken together, these data revealed that JAK2 acts as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer and suggested that inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 activity represents a potential therapeutic opportunity for JAK2-mutated endometrial cancer. Materials and methods Data acquisition The expression profiles, somatic mutation data, and clinical information of EC patients were obtained via the GEPIA database ( http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#analysis , December 7, 2023) and cBioPortal database ( https://www.cbioportal.org/ , December 7, 2023). The Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) ( https://string-db.org , December 7, 2023) database was used to predict the functional interactions of proteins. Ethics statement and clinical samples The Human Investigation Ethics Committee of International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University of Medicine approved this study ([GKLW] 2017-80), and written informed consent was obtained from the patients. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The tissue samples used in this study were obtained from 2019 to 2021 (Supplementary Table 1). None of the patients underwent hormone therapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy prior to surgery. JAK2 and POLE mutation detection in specimens from endometrial cancer patients Genomic DNA was isolated from the tumor-rich regions (at least 50% of tumor cells) of the 99 FFPE samples using the GeneRead DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Germany). PCR amplification was performed via the use of previously described primers and 2 \u00d7 Taq Master Mix [Vazyme Biotech, China] [ 12 , 13 ]. The purified PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing [ 13 ]. In brief, Sanger\u2019s sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) compatible with an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) For IHC, the samples were stained with a rabbit monoclonal antibody against JAK2 (1:1000; CST, Danvers, MA, USA). Two independent pathologists, who were blinded to the clinical and pathological data, evaluated the samples. Sections were evaluated according to semiquantitative immunoreactivity scores [ 14 ]. Cell culture 293 T, KLE, SPEC-2, AN3CA, Ishikawa, HEC-1A and HEC-1B cells were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Committee Type Culture Collection cell bank (Shanghai, China). These cell lines were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)/F12 (Gibco, Auckland, NZ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37 \u00b0C. For the hypoxia experiments, the cells were grown in an in vitro hypoxic (2% O 2 ) container system (BD Diagnostics). Ruxolitinib (1 \u03bcM, Selleck, USA) was prepared for use in cell culture. Transient transfection shRNAs against JAK2 [GV248, sh JAK2-1, sh JAK2-2] and negative control (CON077, sh ctrl) were purchased from GeneCHEM (Shanghai, China). siRNA targeting HIF-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1 siR) and scrambled siRNA were also purchased from GeneCHEM (Shanghai, China). The sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2 and 3. Myc-tagged JAK2 and Flag-tagged HIF-1\u03b1 expression plasmids (pCMV-Myc and pcDNA3.1-Flag-Ha) were purchased from WZ Biosciences Inc (Shanghai, China). Transient transfection was performed in the absence of selection pressure using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection for further experiments. Western blotting Proteins were extracted via a RIPA kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing a 1% dilution of the protease inhibitor PMSF (Beyotime). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against JAK2 (1:1000; CST), HIF-1\u03b1 (1:1000, CST) and GAPDH (1:5000, CST) individually at 4 \u2103 overnight. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:2000, Proteintech) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies. ImageJ software was are used to quantify the expression of the proteins. RT-qPCR Total RNA was isolated from the cell lines with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Subsequently, cDNA was prepared via a reverse transcriptase kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PCR amplification was performed via an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex. An initial 30 s denaturation at 95 \u00b0C was followed by 35 amplification cycles of 5 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 60 \u00b0C, and 10 s at 72 \u00b0C. The data were analysed using the 2 \u2212\u25b3\u25b3Ct formula. The primer sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table 4. The experiments were repeated at least three times. Cell proliferation assays For the CCK-8 assay, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1 \u00d7 10 3 cells/well and cultured for 1\u20135 days via the CCK-8 Kit (Dojindo). Absorbance values were determined at 450 nm via a Multimode Plate Reader (Molecular Devices, USA). For the colony formation assay, 200 cells/well were incubated in 6-well plates. When identifiable cell clones had formed, the colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. ImageJ software or manual counting was used to count the number of colonies. All the experiments were repeated at least three times. Cell migration assays The cells were suspended in serum-free medium (200 \u03bcl) and plated at a density of 6 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in the inner chamber which was equipped with an 8.0 \u03bcm poresize polycarbonate membrane. Complete medium (600 \u03bcl) was added to the external chamber. After incubation for 48 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. The cells that migrated to the basal side of the membrane were counted using a microscope. ImageJ software or manual counting was used to count the number of cells. All the experiment was repeated at least three times. RNA-sequencing and data analysis The detailed procedures have been reported in previous study [ 14 ]. In brief, RNA was extracted from KLE cells and KLE cells with JAK2 silencing. mRNA was purified, and a cDNA library was constructed. All raw data were subjected to adaptor trimming and discarded low-quality reads according to the following criteria: removal of adaptor sequences; removal of duplicate sequences; filtering low-quality reads (Phred score threshold of 20). The quality of the remaining \u201cclean reads\u201d were assessed via FastQC and were aligned to the hg19 human genome via HISAT2. Transcripts per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (TPM), which estimates the gene expression levels, were calculated via StringTie. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by StringTie according to the following criteria: FDR < 0.05 and |log 2 FoldChange|> 1. Volcano plots and heatmaps of the DEGs were visualized with R software. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed to further explore the potential functions of JAK2 in the pathology of EC. Co-immunoprecipitation assay For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, a Pierce Classic Magnetic IP/Co-IP Kit (Thermo Fisher) and a Flag Tag IP/Co-IP Kit (Biolinkedin, China) were used. Proteins were analyzed by western blotting (Anti-Flag and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). Statistical analysis All data analyses were performed via Graphpad prism 9.5. The measured data were analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test. * P < 0.05 ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001. Results JAK2 is frequently mutated in EC We analyzed the mutation frequency of JAK2 in different cancer types via TCGA data downloaded from the CBioPortal database. Frequent mutations in JAK2 was found in EC (Fig. 1 A). We further performed bioinformatics analyses of the spectrum of mutations in JAK2. A total of 509 cases were obtained. A total of 64 JAK2 mutations occurred in approximately 9.23% (47/509) of the tumor samples, including 45 missense mutations, 17 truncating mutations, and 2 splice mutations (Fig. 1 B). The high incidence of missense mutations strongly indicates that JAK2 is frequently inactivated in EC. In addition, the co-occurrence of JAK2 and POLE mutations was observed in EC and JAK2 mutations were positively associated with POLE mutations (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1 C). Subsequently, we identified JAK2 mutations in 99 FFPE samples of EC via deep sequencing. Twenty-one mutations (21.21%, 21/99) were detected in these samples, including missencse (16.16%, 19/99) and stop_gained (5.05%, 5/99) mutations (Fig. 1 D and Table 1 ).

For most of the 33 TCGA\u2010derived cancer types, we observed significantly down-regulated JAK2 expression in cancer samples compared with paired normal samples (Fig. 2 A), including EC samples (Fig. 2 B). To assess the levels of JAK2 expression across EC stages, we compared JAK2 expression in patients with stage I, II, III or IV EC. However, JAK2 expression was not associated with EC stage ( P = 0.819) (Fig. 2 C). In terms of the potential prognostic value of the JAK2 expression in EC, patients with high JAK2 expression tended to have a better prognosis than those with the low JAK2 expression, although the trend was not statistically significant ( P = 0.420) (Fig. 2 D). We subsequently examined JAK2 expression in 40 EC tissues and 20 normal endometrial tissues via IHC. We detected that the expression of JAK2 was significantly down-regulated in EC tissues compared with normal endometrial tissues (* P = 0.014, Fig. 2 E, F). Fig. 2 JAK2 is downregulated in EC.

F Immunohistochemistry scores of JAK2 in normal endometrium [n = 20] and EC tissues (n = 40) (* P < 0.05) JAK2 inhibits the proliferation and migration of EC cells JAK2 expression was detected in six endometrial cancer cell lines with different basal JAK2 expression levels. As shown in Fig. 3 A, JAK2 was expressed in KLE, SPEC-2, Ishikawa and AN3CA cells and was nearly undetectable in HEC1-A and HEC1-B cells. To determine the biological role of JAK2 in EC, EC cell lines with JAK2 silencing (KLE and SPEC-2) via shRNAs were established, and the transfection efficiency was determined (Fig. 3 B). We then showed that JAK2 silencing increased the cell proliferation as determined by CCK-8 assays (Fig. 3 C, D). Colony formation assays revealed that JAK2 silencing increased the number of KLE and SPEC-2 colonies (Fig. 3 E, F). A transwell assay was conducted to evaluate the effect of JAK2 silencing on the migration of EC cells. The results showed that JAK2 silencing significantly promoted the migration of KLE and SPEC-2 cells (Fig. 3 G, H). Ruxolitinib, a potent JAK inhibitor, also promoted the proliferation and migration of KLE cells (Fig. 4 A, B). Taken together, these results suggest that JAK2 is critical for on EC cell growth and migration. Fig. 3 JAK2 inhibits the proliferation and migration of EC cells.

Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm Functional analysis of JAK2 To investigate the mechanisms underlying JAK2-mediated EC progression, the global transcriptomic changes in KLE cells with JAK2 silencing were investigated via RNA sequencing. A total of 322 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 172 up-regulated and 150 down-regulated genes, which were generated as a volcano map (Fig. 5 A). The potential biological functions of the JAK2 were explored via KEGG pathway analyses. The results revealed that the HIF-1 signaling pathway was significantly altered, suggesting that JAK2 is likely to interfere with this pathway (Fig. 5 B). We also noticed that the top 50 differentially expressed genes included well-characterized HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional targets, such as PDK3 [ 15 ], CAV1 [ 16 ], and ERO1A [ 17 ] (Fig. 5 C). GSEA revealed that JAK2 silencing up-regulated the HIF-1\u03b1 target gene signature in KLE cells (Fig. 5 D). To further validate whether JAK2 affects the transcriptional outputs of the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway, the mRNA expression of HIF-1\u03b1 downstream target genes was assessed in JAK2 silencing KLE and SPEC-2 cells. We found that hypoxia-induced up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 downstream target genes, including PDK3, ERO1A, and CAV1, was potentiated in JAK2 silencing cells (Fig. 5 E, F). Taken together, these findings indicate that JAK2 may negatively regulate the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway. Fig. 5 Functional analysis of JAK2.

Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3) HIF-1\u03b1 knockdown reverses the JAK2 knockdown\u2013induced growth and migration of EC cells To investigate the possibility that HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in the cell phenotype changes caused by JAK2 knockdown, HIF-1\u03b1 was knockdown by siRNA in JAK2 knockdown cells. We found that the knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 in JAK2 knockdown KLE cells reversed the JAK2 knockdown\u2013induced increase in cell growth and migration (Fig. 6 A, B).

Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm JAK2 inhibited the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway via interacting with HIF-1\u03b1 To further understand the regulatory relationship between JAK2 and HIF-1\u03b1 signaling, we first investigated whether JAK2 had any effect on the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxia (0.2% oxygen). Few changes in the expression level of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA were observed (Fig. 7 A). We constructed a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network of JAK2 via STRING (Fig. 7 B) and found that JAK2 may interact with HIF-1\u03b1. The protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 were increased in JAK2 silencing cells (Fig. 7 C). We also found that exogenous over-expression of Myc-JAK1 reduced Flag-HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 D). Using a co-immunoprecipitation assays, a physical association between HIF-1\u03b1 and JAK2 was detected (Fig. 7 E, F). These results suggest that JAK2 facilitates the degradation of the HIF-1\u03b1 protein to affect its signaling pathway.

F Co-IP assays in KLE cells incubated under hypoxia (2% O 2 ) Discussion Endometrial cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women, with an estimated 66,200 new cases and 13,030 deaths in the United States in 2023 [ 18 ]. Four distinct molecular subgroups (POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy-number low, and copy-number high) were distinguished in endometrial cancer by large-scale sequencing [ 2 ]. This large-scale sequencing provides important information on diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets. POLE/POLD1 exonuclease domain mutations lead to loss of proofreading function, which causes the accumulation of mutant genes in cells [ 19 ]. In our study, a deep sequencing study of endometrial cancer revealed a high frequency of mutations in JAK2, especially in POLE-mutated endometrial cancer. Thus, we hypothesized that JAK2 mutations in endometrial cancer may be partly caused by POLE proofreading defects. A large number of solid tumors exhibit activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway [ 20 ]. Mutations in PTK proteins (including JAK2) usually result in GOF (get-of-function) mutants that drive human cancer [ 21 ]. Somatic JAK2 mutations (including V617F and L604F) are the main molecular causes of the vast majority of polycythemia vera (PV) cases [ 22 ]. The JAK2 V617F mutation is also the major molecular defect in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) [ 23 ]. In hereditary thrombocytosis, the expression of JAK2 R867Q and S755R/R938Q induced spontaneous growth of Ba/F3-MPL cells but not of Ba/F3-EPOR cells [ 24 ]. In our study, most of endometrial cancer-associated JAK2 mutations were missense mutations indicative of loss of function (LOF). Further studies are required to identify the detailed mechanism by which JAK2 mutants (e.g., K251T, R938Q and R564Q) are involved in the carcinogenesis of EC. JAK2 inhibitors is licenced for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera (PV) [ 25 ]. There are several clinical trials on the use of JAK2 inhibitors in patients with cancer [ 26 \u2013 29 ], however, their role in frontline therapy for these disorders still needs to be defined. The discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation initiated a new era of targeted therapy for Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. In our study, we observed that Ruxolitinib promoted proliferation and migration in EC cells. A study revealed that primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mononuclear cells harboring the JAK2 R938Q mutation display reduced sensitivity to the JAK1/2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib in vitro [ 30 ]. Consequently, identifying the specific JAK2 mutants may help us understand the detailed mechanism involved in regulation of Ruxolitinib on EC. In the present study, we propose that JAK2 may promote EC tumorigenesis and progression via the HIF pathway. Previous studies have shown that HIF-1 is regulated via STATs [ 31 \u2013 34 ]. Unexpectedly, our results found that JAK2 negatively regulated HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels via interaction with HIF-1\u03b1 but did not affect HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels. Studies have showed that HIF-1\u03b1 is degraded through the CRL2 VHL ubiquitin ligase complex [ 35 , 36 ]. Lesley A et al. reported PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin to activate Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [ 37 ]. Therefore, whether and how JAK2 activates CRL2 VHL ubiquitin ligase complex to facilitate HIF-1\u03b1 degradation in EC should be investigated in future studies. Substantial evidence has highlighted the important role of HIF-1\u03b1 in tumors, which opens a novel avenue for the research on tumor treatment. Currently, several HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors have been identified, with the underlying mechanisms of action including a reduction in HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional activity, inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 expression, and induction of HIF-1\u03b1 degradation [ 38 ]. However, many issues, such as the efficacy of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors, exist in the process of bringing these inhibitors to clinical applications. Our data suggest that the inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 activity represents a potential therapeutic opportunity for JAK2-mutated EC. In summary, we identified an important tumor-suppressive function of JAK2 and revealed a new possible molecular pathway by which JAK2 inactivation could promote EC tumorigenesis and progression (Fig. 8 ). A wide variety of mouse models should be used for further investigating the function of JAK2 in EC tumorigenesis and progression in vivo.

JAK2 mutations were detected in EC formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples using Sanger sequencing. The expression levels of JAK2 was accessed using the TCGA database and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the relationships between JAK2 expression and staging and prognosis of EC patients were investigated using the TCGA database. Down-regulation of JAK2 were achieved by transient transfection with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Effects of JAK2 on cancer cells proliferation and migration were evaluated by CCK8, colony formation, and transwell assay. The potential biological functions of JAK2 in EC were identified based on bioinformatics analysis. Effects of JAK2 on expression levels of target genes were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays was used to detect the physical association between JAK2 and HIF-1\u03b1. Results Frequent mutations and down-regulation of JAK2 were found in EC. Loss-of-function (LOF) assays suggested that JAK2 silencing in endometrial cancer cells promoted cell proliferation and migration, which were partially dependent on HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that JAK2 interacted with HIF-1\u03b1 and reduced HIF1\u03b1 protein expression under hypoxia. Conclusion These findings revealed novel molecular mechanisms underlying JAK2 LOF mutations-driven endometrial tumorigenesis and revealed that the HIF-1\u03b1 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target in JAK2-mutated endometrial cancer.
