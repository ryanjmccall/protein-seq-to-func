  "abstract_text": "Mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) on chromosome 9p13-p12 were recently found to be associated with hereditary inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of the bone, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). We identified a novel missense mutation in the VCP gene (R159H; 688G>A) segregating with this disease in an Austrian family of four affected siblings, who exhibited progressive proximal myopathy and Paget disease of the bone but without clinical signs of dementia.",
