  "abstract_text": "We isolated genomic fragments containing the 5' region of the human type I insulin-like growth factor receptor gene. A unique transcription start site was identified, defining a 1038 bp 5'-untranslated region. No TATA or CCAAT elements were identified in the proximal 480 nucleotides of 5'-flanking region. The region surrounding the transcription start site was similar to a recently described \"initiator\" sequence. The 5'-flanking and 5'-untranslated regions were highly GC-rich, with numerous potential Sp1 binding sites. A potential AP-2 binding site was identified in the 5'-flanking region and a potential thyroid response element was identified in the 5'-untranslated region. The 5' region of the human gene was very similar to that of the rat gene, with conservation of many of the potential regulatory elements.",
