    "abstract_text": "The role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was investigated in insulin responsive cell lines. mTOR was expressed at high levels in insulin responsive cell types and in 3T3-L1 cells mTOR expression levels increased dramatically as cells differentiated from fibroblasts into insulin responsive adipocytes. mTOR localized to membrane fractions in all cells tested and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes mTOR was specifically localized to microsomal membranes. Protein kinase activity directed towards mTOR was tightly associated with mTOR immunoprecipitates and this kinase activity was inhibited by FKBP12-rapamycin indicating it was due to an autokinase activity present in mTOR. The mTOR autokinase and the protein kinase activity of the p110 alpha isoform of PI 3-kinase shared several notable similarities; (a) both were maximally active in the presence of Mn2+ but also showed significant activity in the presence of Mg2+ (b) neither were inhibited by the presence of non-ionic detergent and (c) both were inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002, known inhibitors of the PI 3-kinase lipid kinase activity. These data taken together indicate the autokinase activity lay in the PI 3-kinase homology domain. In summary mTOR is a membrane anchored protein kinase that is active in conditions encountered in vivo and the fact it is highly expressed in insulin responsive cell types is consistent with a role in insulin signalling.",
