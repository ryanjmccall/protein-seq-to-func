    "abstract_text": "Two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy has been applied to a structural analysis of the reduced form of a recombinant human thioredoxin, a ubiquitous dithiol oxidoreductase recently isolated from an immunocompetent lymphoblastoid cell line. The sequential assignment of the spectrum, including all proline residues, has been accomplished by using experiments to demonstrate through-bond and through-space connectivities. The secondary structure has been determined by a qualitative interpretation of nuclear Overhauser effects, NH exchange data, and 3JHN alpha coupling constants. The secondary structure was found to be similar to that of the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli thioredoxin, consisting of a mixed five-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helices. The assignment and structural characterization of human thioredoxin was facilitated by the increased resolution and sensitivity afforded by a magnetic field strength of 600 MHz and required the use of two temperatures and two pH conditions to resolve ambiguities caused by a duplication of resonances. This duplication, extending from Phe-41 to Val-59, and including Lys-3-Ile-5, Val-24, Val-25, Asn-39, and Ile-101-Glu-103, appears to be due to heterogeneity arising from the presence or absence of the N-terminal methionine.",
