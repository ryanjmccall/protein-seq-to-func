    "abstract_text": "Binding of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to the fibroblast growth factor receptor leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor on several tyrosine residues. Wild-type FGF receptor 1 (flg) and a mutated receptor (Y766F), in which an autophosphorylation site (Tyr-766) was mutated to phenylalanine, were expressed in rat myoblasts and in hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells. It was found that the point mutation at Tyr-766 resulted in a decrease in FGF receptor internalization, as well as a reduction in both ligand-induced FGF receptor down-regulation and degradation. It has been shown previously that phosphorylation of Tyr-766 is essential for interaction with phospholipase C gamma and that the Y766F FGF receptor mutant is unable to stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and Ca2+ release from internal stores. The results presented in this report indicate that Tyr-766 is also essential for cellular trafficking of FGF receptor.",
