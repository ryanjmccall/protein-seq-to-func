    "abstract_text": "TRAF2 and ASK1 play essential roles in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Stimulation through TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) leads to TRAF2 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Here we show that TNFR2 signaling also leads to selective ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation in proteasomes. c-IAP1 was identified as the ubiquitin protein ligase for ASK1 ubiquitination, and studies with primary B cells from c-IAP1 knock-out animals revealed that c-IAP1 is required for TNFR2-induced TRAF2 and ASK1 degradation. Moreover, in the absence of c-IAP1 TNFR2-mediated p38 and JNK activation was prolonged. Thus, the ubiquitin protein ligase activity of c-IAP1 is responsible for regulating the duration of TNF signaling in primary cells expressing TNFR2.",
