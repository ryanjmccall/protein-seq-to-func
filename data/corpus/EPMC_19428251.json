  "abstract_text": "The synthesis, in vitro properties, and in vivo pharmacokinetics for a series of sulfoximine-substituted trifluoromethylpyrimidines as inhibitors of proline-rich tyrosine kinase, a target for the possible treatment of osteoporosis, are described. These compounds were prepared as surrogates of the corresponding sulfone compound 1. Sulfone 1 was an attractive PYK2 lead compound; however, subsequent studies determined this compound possessed high dofetilide binding, which is an early indicator of cardiovascular safety. Surprisingly, the corresponding sulfoximine analogs displayed significantly lower dofetilide binding, which, for N-methylsulfoximine (S)-14a, translated to lower activity in a patch clamp hERG K(+) ion channel screen. In addition, compound (S)-14a shows good oral exposure in a rat pharmacokinetic model.",
