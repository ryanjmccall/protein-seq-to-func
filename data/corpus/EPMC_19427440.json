    "abstract_text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heritable, genetically heterogeneous disorder. To identify gene defects that cause or confer susceptibility to AF, a cohort of 268 unrelated patients with idiopathic forms of familial and sporadic AF was recruited. LMNA, encoding the nuclear membrane proteins, lamin A/C, was selected as a candidate gene for lone AF based on its established association with a syndrome of dilated cardiomyopathy, conduction system disease, and AF. Comprehensive mutation scanning identified only 1 potentially pathogenic mutation. In conclusion, LMNA mutations rarely cause lone AF and routine genetic testing of LMNA in these patients does not appear warranted.",
