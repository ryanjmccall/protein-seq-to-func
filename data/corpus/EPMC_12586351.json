    "abstract_text": "Insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-2 were assayed from human plasma via biomolecular interaction analysis mass spectrometry, utilizing antibodies as ligands for affinity retrieval. Detection of both targeted and non-targeted IGFs in the mass spectra indicated possible protein complex retrieval by the individual antibodies. A series of control experiments eliminated the possibility of analyte cross-walking between flow cells, significant antibodies cross-reactivity, and direct IGF interactions. To disrupt the putative protein complex and release its constituent proteins, plasma samples were treated with detergents. An SDS-treated plasma yielded IGF signals in a different ratio than the one observed in the mass spectra from the non-treated plasma, suggesting disruption of the protein complex, and its retrieval from non-treated plasma. Novel truncated IGF-2 variant, missing its N-terminal Alanine, was detected in all mass spectra.",
