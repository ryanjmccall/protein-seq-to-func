Summary The integrity of the nuclear envelope (NE) is essential for maintaining the structural stability of the nucleus. Rupture of the NE has been frequently observed in cancer cells, especially in the context of mechanical challenges, such as physical confinement and migration. However, spontaneous NE rupture events, without any obvious physical challenges to the cell, have also been described. The molecular mechanism(s) of these spontaneous NE rupture events remain to be explored. Here, we show that DNA damage and subsequent ATR activation leads to NE rupture. Upon DNA damage, lamin A/C is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner, leading to changes in lamina assembly and, ultimately, NE rupture. In addition, we show that cancer cells with intrinsic DNA repair defects undergo frequent events of DNA-damage-induced NE rupture, which renders them extremely sensitive to further NE perturbations. Exploiting this NE vulnerability could provide a new angle to complement traditional, DNA-damage-based chemotherapy.

Keywords nuclear envelope rupture lamina lamin A/C phosphorylation DNA damage replication stress ATR synthetic lethality NE vulnerability homologous recombination deficiency Published: October 12, 2023 Introduction Maintaining nuclear envelope (NE) integrity is crucial for proper chromatin organization, DNA transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Consequently, the loss of NE integrity can lead to aberrant chromatin organization, the accumulation of DNA damage, and defective DNA replication and repair, ultimately leading to cell death or senescence. 1 , 2 Furthermore, in the context of densely packed solid tumors, the loss of NE integrity has been shown to be linked to increased metastatic potential. 3 , 4 Therefore, understanding the determinants of NE integrity is of key importance. To maintain its integrity, the NE is supported by an underlying meshwork of intermediate filaments called the lamina. The lamina is a rigid, gel-like structure providing mechanical support to the more fluid NE. However, the structural stability of the nucleus can be challenged in several ways, leading to a loss of NE integrity. Mutations or changes in the expression of lamins can lead to altered nuclear stiffness and a loss of NE integrity. 5 , 6 This becomes even more apparent when NE integrity is further challenged by mechanical forces. 7 The NE is linked to the cytoskeleton via the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex; therefore, any mechanical force experienced by the cell is transmitted through the cytoskeleton to the NE. For instance, strong mechanical forces can lead to a loss of NE integrity even in cells with an intact lamina. Cells under physical confinement or cells undergoing constricted migration exhibit a loss of NE integrity, resulting in NE rupture. 8 , 9 , 10 In addition to external constraints, NE integrity can also be compromised due to forces produced by the cell itself. Although the former is well characterized, the latter remains poorly understood. For example, chromatin decompaction has been associated with NE rupture. 11 As the NE is tightly linked to the chromatin, it has been proposed that mechanical forces can be exerted upon the NE through changes in chromatin organization. In addition, the loss of p53 or Rb, two of the most commonly mutated tumor suppressors, was shown to increase the levels of NE rupture. 12 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain unclear. Similarly, the two major kinases (ATM and ATR) of the DNA damage response (DDR) have also been implicated in the regulation of NE integrity. Cells lacking ATR or ATM exhibit a range of phenotypes linked to a loss of NE integrity. 13 , 14 In addition, ATR is present at the NE, where it might act as a mechanosensor, independently of DNA damage, 15 whereas ATM activity can regulate nuclear stiffness. 16 Further strengthening the idea of ATR and ATM acting as mechanosensors, they both contain several HEAT repeat motifs, 17 which are known to function as mechano-elastic conductors. 18 However, what is the consequence of this mechanosensory activation and its connection to the DDR remain to be addressed. We have found that ATR kinase activity induces NE rupture in p53-deficient cells. Mechanistically, ATR activation leads to NE rupture through the phosphorylation of lamin A/C on its S282 residue. The lack of this phosphorylation leads to the formation of lamin A/C aggregates and aberrant lamina organization. Furthermore, the loss of lamin A/C phosphorylation decreases the association of lamin A/C with the LINC complex and the histone variant macro-H2A.2, which function as cytoskeleton and chromatin anchors, respectively. Subsequently, the loss of the lamin A/C phosphorylation results in a detachment of the lamina from both the chromatin and cytoskeleton, preventing NE rupture. Taken together, our findings support a model where ATR plays an important role in mediating lamina-cytoskeleton and lamina-chromatin connections, promoting NE rupture. In addition, we have found that cells with an intrinsic accumulation of DNA damage and subsequent ATR activation, such as homologous-recombination-deficient (HRD) cells, show decreased NE integrity. Lastly, we have found that this NE vulnerability can be targeted, for example, by blocking NE reassembly and repair, resulting in the death of HRD cells. Results ATR activation leads to NE rupture in p53-deficient cells The long-term loss of ATR can lead to decreased nuclear integrity; however, the exact role played by ATR kinase activity in nuclear integrity remains unclear. 14 In addition, the loss of p53 was shown to induce spontaneous NE rupture events. 12 To test the involvement of ATR activity and its relationship with p53 in NE rupture, we induced NE rupture in p53-proficient and -deficient retinal pigment epithelial-1 (RPE-1) cells. We subjected cells to physical confinement 10 and monitored the recruitment of the cytosolic DNA sensor, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), to sites of NE ruptures ( Video S1 ). As expected, we found that p53-deficient (TP53 \u2212/\u2212 ) cells were more prone to NE rupture upon confinement ( Figure 1 A). Strikingly, we found that although ATR inhibition (ATRi) did not significantly impact NE rupture levels upon confinement in wild-type (WT) cells, it completely rescued NE rupture in TP53 \u2212/\u2212 cells to the level of that in WT control cells ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). This indicates that ATR kinase activity plays a crucial role in inducing NE rupture events in p53-deficient cells. To further investigate the role of ATR activity in NE rupture, we induced NE rupture by chromatin decompaction. 11 We found that, similar to direct mechanical stimulation, 15 inducing chromatin decompaction by the inhibition of either histone methyl transferases (HMTi) or histone deacetylases (HDACi) led to ATR activation, without the accumulation of DNA damage ( Figure 1 B). Furthermore, this could be prevented by the compaction of the chromatin using histone demethylase inhibition (HDMi). In addition, we found that, similar to NE rupture induced by confinement, ATRi also prevented NE rupture induced by chromatin decompaction ( Figure 1 C). Figure 1 ATR activation mediates the rupture of the nuclear envelope (A) Quantification of NE rupture in WT and TP53 \u2212/\u2212 cells under 3 \u03bcm confinement, untreated or treated with ATRi.

Chromatin herniation and NE rupture under confinement, related to Figures 1A and S1A DNA damage induces NE rupture through ATR activation ATR activation is mostly associated with DNA damage induction. Therefore, we sought to understand whether ATR\u2019s activity as a DDR kinase could be linked to ATR\u2019s role in modulating NE rupture. To assess this, we induced ATR activation using various DNA-damaging agents and quantified NE rupture events in TP53 \u2212/\u2212 cells. Strikingly, we found that the levels of NE rupture were increased by all the DNA-damaging agents tested ( Figures 1 D and S1 B\u2013S1F; Videos S2 and S3 ) and that this was dependent on ATR activation ( Figures 1 E, S1 G, and S1H). Video S2. NLS-mCherry leakage and cGAS-GFP recruitment upon NE rupture, related to Figure S1H Video S3. NE rupture in S-phase upon CPT treatment in WT cells, related to Figure S2D Taken together, these data indicate that confinement-induced, chromatin-decompaction-induced, and DNA-damage-induced NE rupture all depend on ATR kinase activity, identifying ATR as a master regulator of NE rupture ( Figures S2 A\u2013S2H). Nuclear actin filaments are crucial for ATR-mediated NE rupture The main target and downstream effector of ATR in the DDR is checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). To test whether ATR activity leads to NE rupture through the activation of Chk1, we treated cells with an inhibitor of Chk1 and assessed NE rupture. Interestingly, we found that, unlike ATRi, Chk1i did not affect the levels of NE rupture ( Figure S3 A). Recently, ATR was shown to regulate nucleoskeleton dynamics through the formation of nuclear actin filaments. 19 We reasoned that these filaments might play a role in NE rupture. To test this, we blocked the formation of these filaments by inhibiting two separate steps in the cascade leading to their formation. 19 Blocking either mTORC1 (mTORi) or Arp2/3 (Arp2/3i) resulted in a complete prevention of DNA-damage-induced NE rupture ( Figures 2 A and S3 B\u2013S3F). Furthermore, the depletion of the pool of nuclear actin by the knockdown of importin 9 (IPO9) (the importin responsible for actin transport into the nucleus) resulted in a similar decrease in NE rupture. Importantly, this could be rescued by the expression of WT actin with a 3xNLS tag, but not with the R62D mutant, which is unable to form filaments ( Figures 3 B and S3 G). Taken together, this indicates a critical role played by nuclear actin filaments in DNA-damage-induced NE rupture.

Data show mean \u00b1 SEM. Scale bars represent 10 \u03bcm. Asterisks indicate statistical significance. Next, we used live-cell imaging to follow the formation of nuclear actin filaments using cells stably expressing a genetically encoded actin nanobody fused to mCherry and an NLS peptide. We monitored nuclear actin filament formation together with NE rupture events, following treatment with camptothecin (CPT), a DNA-damaging agent inducing NE rupture ( Figure 1 D). Interestingly, we could not observe any obvious filaments in the vicinity of the sites of NE rupture. However, in most cases (70%), we observed the appearance of a small circular actin filament that preceded an NE rupture event ( Figures 2 C and S3 H). Although our data clearly indicate a role for nuclear actin in mediating NE rupture upon ATR activation, the precise mechanism by which it plays this role will require further investigation. Quantitative MS identifies ATR-dependent phosphorylation targets at the nuclear periphery To decipher the molecular mechanism of DNA-damage-induced NE rupture, we carried out an unbiased, mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of the perinuclear fraction following DNA damage ( Table S1 , tabs 1\u20134). Briefly, cells were fractionated, and proteins in the vicinity of the nuclear periphery were collected for MS analysis ( Figures S4 A and S4B). To identify potential ATR phosphorylation targets, we evaluated the phosphorylation of proteins at the NE. First, we compared phosphorylation levels in untreated cells and cells treated with CPT ( Figure 2 D; Table S1 , tab 2). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis identified actin-binding proteins as some of the top hits to be phosphorylated upon DNA damage, consistent with the role of nuclear actin in NE rupture ( Figure 2 D; Table S1 , tab 3). Next, to narrow down the list of hits and identify ATR targets, we compared untreated and CPT-treated samples with samples co-treated with CPT and ATRi ( Figure 2 E; Table S1 , tab 2). With this approach, we identified a group of proteins that showed an ATR-dependent phosphorylation upon DNA damage. Interestingly, we found very few proteins of the DDR among our hits, supporting the notion that ATR\u2019s role in NE rupture is distinct from its role in the DDR. One clear exception was p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), a known interactor of lamin B1. 20 We found 53BP1 to be extremely abundant and highly phosphorylated ( Figures 2 D and 2E; Table S1 , tabs 1 and 2). GO term analysis of potential ATR targets revealed two clear clusters among the hits, one related to RNA biology and one related to the structural organization of the nucleus ( Figure 2 F; Table S1 , tab 4). The latter included processes linked to NE and chromatin organization, as well as actin-related processes. Among these hits, we identified several potential regulators of NE rupture, based on their involvement in the DDR and chromatin or NE organization ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Of all the hits, we decided to focus on lamin A/C ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and S4 C; Table S1 , tabs 1 and 2) because of its direct involvement in nuclear architecture. ATR-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C controls cytoskeleton and chromatin anchoring S282 is located in the coil 2 domain of lamin A/C, a region highly conserved among vertebrates ( Figures 3 A and 3B). This domain is important for the polymerization and, therefore, spatial organization of the protein. 21 , 22 , 23 Phosphorylation of this residue has been reported in several high-throughput studies 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ; however, no known function has been attributed to this phosphorylation site to date. To study the function and importance of this phosphorylation, we generated isogenic cell lines expressing a WT or phospho-dead (S282A) version of lamin A/C, tagged with mCherry ( Figures S5 A and S5B). We have found that S282A had an increased tendency to form aggregates ( Figures 3 C and S5 C), supporting the notion that S282 phosphorylation on lamin A/C is required for proper lamina assembly. 28 Live microscopy analysis revealed that the S282A mutation caused the formation of lamina aggregates upon mitotic exit ( Figure 3 D; Video S4 ). Upon closer inspection of the 3D structure of these aggregates, we found that they are connected to the lamina layer; colocalized with lamin B1; and often located at aberrant structures, such as invaginations ( Figures 3 E, 3F, and S5 D; Video S5 ). Next, to further characterize the role of ATR-mediated phosphorylation in the organization of the lamina, we carried out quantitative MS analysis to identify differential binding partners of WT and S282 lamin A/C ( Table S1 , tab 5). As expected, very few hits showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) enrichment in WT compared with S282A samples. Strikingly, among the 8 hits identified that bind more (at least 2-fold) to WT than to S282A, we found three members of the LINC complex (Nesprin-1, Nesprin-2, and SUN1) and one LINC-associated protein (TMEM201) ( Figure 3 G). Immunoprecipitations (IP) coupled with immunoblotting confirmed the preferential association of the LINC complex with WT lamin A/C, compared with the S282A mutant ( Figure 3 G). This indicates that ATR-dependent lamin A/C phosphorylation favors the connection of the cytoskeleton to the NE. Furthermore, macro-H2.A2, a histone variant known to act as a chromatin anchor, 29 was present only in WT samples, not in S282A ( Figure 3 G), suggesting that the ATR phosphorylation of lamin A/C also contributes to the anchoring of the chromatin to the lamina. Video S4. Formation and disappearance of lamin A/C aggregates in S282A-expressing cells, related to Figures 3C\u20133F, S5C, and S5D Video S5. 3D rotation showing lamin A/C organization in S282A-expressing cells, related to Figures 3C\u20133F, S5C, and S5D ATR-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C is needed for NE rupture NE-cytoskeleton connections through the LINC complex have been shown to be key determinants of NE rupture. 7 To assess the role of the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C in NE rupture, we compared the capacity of WT and S282A cells to undergo DNA-damage-induced NE rupture. Strikingly, we found that, although WT-expressing cells exhibited the same potential for NE rupture as control cells, S282A-expressing cells did not undergo NE rupture upon CPT treatment ( Figures 3 H and S5 F). Importantly, we have confirmed that ATR activation is the same in WT and S282A cells ( Figure S5 E). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of lamin A/C on its S282 residue mediates ATR-dependent NE rupture through the modulation of NE anchoring. Reinforcing this notion, we found that the knockdown of Nesprin-2 could prevent DNA-damage-induced NE rupture ( Figure S5 G). Taken together, our data identify the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C as a key factor in the regulation of lamina organization and anchoring of both the cytoskeleton and the chromatin to the lamina and NE. Furthermore, the ATR-mediated regulation of lamina organization is needed for DNA-damage-induced NE rupture. However, whether lamin A/C is targeted by ATR directly or indirectly remains to be confirmed. HRD cells have increased NE rupture and NE vulnerability High ATR activity is common in many tumors, and this is especially true for HRD cells due to the accumulation of intrinsic DNA damage. 30 As a model for HRD, we used our previously generated BRCA2 \u2212/\u2212 cells, 31 which showed a constitutive activation of ATR, at similar levels to CPT-treated isogenic WT RPE-1 cells ( Figure 4 A). As NE rupture events are generally transient, to accurately assess the consequences of this constitutive ATR activation with regard to NE rupture, we decided to monitor NE rupture events during a full cell cycle. We found that a striking 27% of BRCA2 \u2212/\u2212 cells underwent at least one event of NE rupture during a full cell cycle ( Figure 4 A). We confirmed that NE rupture events in BRCA2 \u2212/\u2212 cells were also dependent on ATR activity and lamin A/C phosphorylation ( Figures 4 B, 4C, and S6 A\u2013S6E). Figure 4 HRD cells have increased NE rupture and NE vulnerability (A) Shown on the left is the quantification of NE rupture in cells observed for a full cell cycle by time-lapse microscopy. Scheme is shown on top. In the middle, the representative immunoblot of phosphorylated ATR (pATR) in WT and BRCA2 \u2212/\u2212 cells upon indicated treatment is shown.

For image quantifications, at least 100 cells were analyzed for each condition in each experiment. Data show mean \u00b1 SEM. Scale bars represent 10 \u03bcm. Asterisks indicate statistical significance. We next reasoned that these iterative events of NE rupture could constitute a vulnerability of HRD cells. Interestingly, we have found that BRCA2 \u2212/\u2212 cells were extremely sensitive to the knockdown of VPS4B ( Figures 4 D and S6 F\u2013S6I), a component of the endosomal sorting complexes for transport-III (ESCRTIII) complex, responsible for NE reassembly and repair. 32 Similarly, VPS4B \u2212/\u2212 cells were extremely sensitive to BRCA2 knockdown ( Figures 4 E and S6 J\u2013S6L), confirming the synthetic lethal relationship between the two proteins. When observing mitotic exit using live microscopy, we found that whereas deficiency in either BRCA2 or VPS4B led to an increase in the frequency of mitotic catastrophe, the loss of both factors led to a synergistic effect, resulting in extensive mitotic abnormalities and cell death ( Figure 4 F). This indicates that HRD cells are reliant on ESCRTIII activity, due to an intrinsic NE vulnerability, evidenced by increased NE rupture and defective NE reassembly. To note, we have confirmed that synthetic lethality between BRCA2 and VPS4B is not due to DNA damage accumulation, as we saw no increase in the number of \u03b3H2AX foci ( Figures 4 G and S6 L). To further exploit the NE vulnerability of HRD cells, we treated WT and BRCA2 \u2212/\u2212 cells with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277. This inhibitor blocks the normal maturation of lamins and results in aberrant lamin localization. 33 Similarly to VPS4B knockdown, BRCA2 \u2212/\u2212 cells showed a greatly increased sensitivity to FTI when compared with an isogenic control ( Figure 4 H). This indicates that HRD cells rely on proper lamina organization for their survival, reinforcing the notion of increased NE vulnerability in these cells ( Figures S7 A\u2013S7G). Based on our findings, we propose that targeting NE vulnerability in these cells by either weakening the lamina or disrupting NE repair or reformation mechanisms could constitute novel avenues for the treatment of HRD tumors ( Figure 4 I). Discussion Here, we describe NE rupture as an unanticipated consequence of DNA damage. We show that DNA damage activates the DDR kinase ATR, which, in turn, leads to the phosphorylation of lamin A/C on its S282 residue. This phosphorylation leads to changes in lamina assembly, altering the anchoring of both the cytoskeleton and chromatin to the NE and the lamina. The loss of this phosphorylation leads to the detachment of the lamina from both the NE and the chromatin, preventing NE rupture. Both the tumor suppressor p53 and the DDR kinase ATR have been linked to the regulation of NE rupture. 12 , 14 Here, we show that in p53-deficient cells, ATR kinase activity promotes NE rupture, unlike what has been observed in p53-proficient cells, 14 leaving the role of p53 in NE rupture in question. Upon DNA damage accumulation, p53 blocks mitotic entry. One could speculate that by not allowing cells with DNA damage to pass through mitosis, p53 could negate ATR-mediated NE rupture. However, this is unlikely, as the live-cell imaging of DNA-damage-induced NE rupture indicates that NE rupture happens in the same S-phase as damage induction ( Figures S2 D and S2E; Video S3 ). Another possibility is that the phosphorylation of p53 by ATR creates an inhibitory feedback loop, blocking ATR-mediated NE rupture. This idea is supported by the fact that 3 h of pre-treatment with ATRi is enough to counteract confinement-induced NE rupture in p53-deficient cells. ATR regulates both DNA repair and checkpoint activation upon DNA damage, halting the cell cycle while promoting repair. We speculate that ATR might fulfill similar functions upon mechanical stress, controlling cell-cycle progression, while responding to mechanical stress by regulating nuclear architecture. It has been shown that ATR can phosphorylate Chk1 upon mechanical stress, 15 supporting the idea of a mechanical-stress-induced cell-cycle checkpoint. In addition, we show here that chromatin decompaction can also lead to ATR activation, indicating that ATR might also act as a sensor of chromatin organization. Based on these data, we posit that ATR might be activated upon various mechanical stimuli, such as changes in membrane tension, changes in cell size and/or shape, or changes in the conformation or localization of chromosomes in relation to the NE. Upon activation, ATR can control cell-cycle progression and the organization of nuclear architecture, for example, through the phosphorylation of lamin A/C. We show here that the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C controls lamina assembly and the anchoring of the lamina to the chromatin and cytoskeleton. The loss of this phosphorylation leads to the formation of aggregates of lamin A/C. We have found that cells harboring aggregates do not enter mitosis ( Video S4 ). Concordantly, the loss of the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C leads to an accumulation of cells in G2 ( Figure S5 B). This could indicate that lamin A/C phosphorylation might represent a dual function of ATR\u2019s response to mechanical stimuli by both regulating cell-cycle progression and nuclear architecture. A second mechanism through which ATR activity can regulate nuclear architecture is the formation of nuclear actin filaments. 19 We show here that these filaments are crucial for DNA-damage-induced NE rupture; however, they are unlikely to exert enough physical force on the lamina to elicit NE rupture by themselves. Therefore, we hypothesize that they might act as a recruitment platform or a priming mechanism to mark the spot for rupture. Alternatively, they could be essential for the reorganization of the chromatin in the vicinity of the lamina, as several groups have postulated that nuclear actin filaments might be essential for the relocalization of DNA breaks. 34 , 35 , 36 We also show that the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C might regulate the anchoring of the chromatin to the lamina. Supporting this idea, it has been shown in yeast cells that Mec1 (homolog of ATR) controls the attachment of the chromatin to nuclear pores. 37 However, to understand how changes in chromatin organization upon DNA damage contribute to NE rupture, further investigation is needed. Recently, ATM, a second major kinase of the DDR has been shown to regulate lamin A/C expression 13 as well as nuclear stiffness. 16 We found that ATM also regulates NE rupture upon DNA damage, although to a lesser extent than ATR ( Figures S2 H and S6 B). This suggests that, as in the DDR, ATR and ATM might fulfill both complementary and somewhat redundant functions as regulators of nuclear architecture. It would be interesting to further investigate potential downstream targets of these two kinases to map out the regulation of nuclear architecture by their respective activities. Cancer cells often show increased levels of replication stress and DNA damage, leading to ATR and ATM activation. This, in turn, can result in NE rupture ( Figure S7 C). Furthermore, the nuclear deformation of cancer cells has been observed for decades 38 ; however, the underlying rationale for this deformation remains unknown. Many contributing factors could be imagined, such as the defective rebuilding of the NE due to the misalignment of aneuploid chromosomes or, alternatively, aberrant lamina organization due to increased ATR or ATM activation. We hypothesize that nuclear deformation is a phenotype that can also be associated with NE vulnerability, similarly to NE rupture. Taken together, we can envision that any cancer cell with increased replication stress; DNA damage; chromosomal abnormalities; and, therefore, genomic instability might exhibit frequent NE rupture events/NE vulnerability. In this scenario, ATR/ATM activation could be used as a biomarker of NE vulnerability. Subsequently, because of their NE vulnerability, cancer cells could be sensitive to NE perturbations, such as challenging lamina assembly or NE repair, as we have described for HRD cells. Furthermore, we posit that HRD tumors with acquired chemoresistance would still display NE vulnerability, as they rely heavily on ATR activity for their survival. 39 Therefore, to better understand NE vulnerability and its clinical applications, further investigation of the interplay between DNA damage and the structural integrity of the nucleus is warranted. Limitations of the study Our study describes the phenomenon of DNA-damage-induced NE rupture. One limitation that hinders the elucidation of the mechanistic details of this process is temporal resolution. NE rupture starts occurring around 12 h after DNA damage induction. Many steps could potentially take place in this time period that remain to be described. Furthermore, technical limitations make it challenging to observe the formation of nuclear actin filaments. The development of new tools and microscopy techniques to monitor these filaments should greatly improve our understanding of the role they play in NE rupture. In addition, the detection and study of the phosphorylation of lamin A/C on S282 are challenging in several ways. Lamin A/C is heavily phosphorylated on several residues in close vicinity to each other. The relatively low abundance of phosphorylation on S282 compared with other sites makes the detection of phosphorylation by general methods difficult. Furthermore, the purification of lamin A/C is extremely challenging, rendering in vitro studies inaccessible. Developing a phospho-specific antibody for S282 will allow for a more in depth understanding of its regulation and function.

Experimental model and study participant details Cell culture and cell line generation MCF10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX\u2122 Supplement (Gibco) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Sigma), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma), 100 ng/mL human insulin (Sigma) and 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone (Calbiochem). MDA-MB-436, HCC1937, A2780, Kuramachi and OVSAHO cells were maintained in RPMI1640 (Sigma), OVCAR8, MCF7, SKOV3, VU423, Capan-1, GM639 and Lenti-X 293T cells were maintained in DMEM High-Glucose (Sigma). hTERT immortalized RPE-1 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX\u2122 Supplement (Gibco). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) (20% fo CAPAN-1), except for MCF10A cells, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). All cell lines in the manuscript were derived from RPE-1 cells. All cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . All cell lines acquired using antibiotic resistance were maintained in antibiotics. Experiments in hypoxia were done at 1% O 2 . RPE-1 TP53 -/- WT and isogenic BRCA2 -/- cell lines were described previously. 31 VPS4B -/- cells were obtained, using transfection of RNP complexes by RNAiMax (ThermoFisher Scientific). RNP complexes were assembled from S. pyogenes Cas9 nuclease, Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNAs and tracrRNA (Integrated DNA technologies 1081058 and 1072532). The following 4 sequences were targeted simultaneously, TATACCCTGCTGTCTTGCTT, TTGGTCTCCAACCCTGCTGG, GTGGTTGTGTGGAGACCGTA and GGAATATTATCCATTCAACT. Clones were first screened by PCR (using TERRA polymerase) and validated by WB. cGAS-GFP expressing were obtained by lentiviral transduction, using pTRIP-CMV-GFP-FLAG-cGAS E225A-D227A (Addgene #86674) followed by cell sorting. H1-mCardinal expressing cells were obtained by retroviral transduction, using the pMXS IRES blast H1-mCardinal plasmid (a kind gift from Olivier Ganier) followed by blasticidin selection (21 \u03bcg/ml) and cell sorting. Nuclear actin chromobody expressing cells were obtained by retroviral transduction using, pOZ-VHH(actin)-GFP-NLS or pOZ-VHH(actin)-mCherry-NLS (this study), followed by selection using magnetic Dynabeads (Life Technologies) conjugated to the IL2R antibody (Millipore). All viral particles were obtained after transfection of Lenti-X cells with desired contruct and viral packaging plasmids (Addgene #12259 and #12260 for lentivirus; and #14887 and #8454 for retrovirus). mCherry-NLS, mCherry-PCNA or mCherry-Lamin A/C expressing cells were generated by transfection (using LTX), using the pmCherry-C1 mCherry-NLS plasmid (Addgene #58476), the mCherry-PCNA-19-SV40NLS-4 plasmid (Addgene, #55117) or mCherry-Lamin A/C-WT or -S282A plasmids (this study) followed by Neomycin/G418 selection (600 \u03bcg/ml) and cell sorting. For mCherry-Lamin A/C expressing cells, single cell clones were selected based on expression levels, evaluated by Western blot (WB). Clones with similar levels of expression to endogenous levels of Lamin A/C were chosen. In Figure 3 H, endogenous Lamin A/C was knocked down by siRNA, therefore cells only express exogenous constructs. Knockdown efficiency and siRNA resistance of exogenous constructs were confirmed by WB. In all other figures, both endogenous Lamin A/C and exogenous constructs were expressed. Method details Cloning To obtain pOZ-VHH(actin)-GFP-NLS, first, VHH(actin)-GFP-NLS was PCR amplified from the Nuclear actin chromobody plasmid (Chromotek, acg-n), using the following primers: pOZ NACB XhoI F and pOZ NACB NotI R. Then this PCR product was cloned into a pOZ vector using BglII and NotI cut sites. To obtain pOZ-VHH(actin)-mCherry-NLS, first, VHH(actin) was PCR amplified from the Nuclear actin chromobody plasmid (Chromotek, acg-n) using the following primers: pOZ-actin-VHH-BglII-F and Linker-mCherry-R. Next, it was fused to mCherry-NLS, generated from pLNCX2-mCherry-CHMP4B (Addgene, #116923), using the following primers: Linker mCherry F and mCherry NLS NotI R. Finally, the fusion product, VHH(actin)-mCherry-NLS was cloned into a pOZ vector using BglII and NotI cut sites. siRNA resistant mCherry-Lamin A/C constructs were obtained in the following way. To obtain mCherry-Lamin A/C-WT, the custom gene block LMNA-sires-mut (IDT) was cloned into mCherry-LaminA-C-18 (Addgene #55068) using BglII and ApaI cut sites. To obtain mCherry-Lamin A/C-S282A, the same gene block was cloned into mCherry-Lamin A/C-WT using BlpI cut sites. All PCR reactions were carried out using Phusion (ThermoFisher) or Fidelio (Takara) polymerases, following the manufacturers` instruction. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and restriction digestions were carried out according to the manufacturer`s instruction. For all cloning, Stbl3 (ThermoFisher) bacterial cells were used and DNA was extracted using Maxiprep Kit (ThermoFisher). Confinement For measurements of NE rupture upon confinement, cells were seeded 24 hours (h) before confinement on Glass Bottom 6-well plates (MatTek) and treated with ATRi for 3 h before confinement. Confinement was performed as in Nader et al., 3 using 3.2 \u03bcm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, RTV615, GE) microspacers. Cells were imaged after confinement with an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) using 40x objective. During the entire time of imaging the temperature was kept at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5% by an on-stage incubation chamber. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ/Fiji software (NIH). For visualization of nuclear actin filaments by time-lapse imaging, glass bottom plates were coated with 0.01 mg/mL fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and cells were seeded 48 h before confinement. Cells were treated with CPT (100 nM) 6 -15 h before confinement. Confinement was performed using 4.9 \u03bcm microspacers. Time-lapse recordings were acquired with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning-disc head on a DMI-8 Leica inverted microscope. Multi-position imaging was facilitated by a NanoScanZ piezo focusing stage (Prior Scientific) and a motorized scanning stage (Marzhauser). A Hamamatsu OrcaFlash 4.0 Camera and 63x/1.4 NA oil-immersion objective were used to take 6 images per z-stack, every 5 or 10 minutes (min) up to 18 h using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). During the entire time of imaging the temperature was kept at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5% by an onstage incubation chamber. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software using the package distribution Fiji (NIH, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ). Live imaging For time-lapse imaging without confinement, cells were plated on 35 mm Ibidi \u03bc-Dishes (Ibidi, 81156) or Ibidi Quad dishes (Ibidi, 80416) and imaged every 10 min for 16\u201372 h on an Inverted Eclipse Ti-E (Nikon) microscope equipped with a stage-top incubator and CO 2 delivery system. Images were taken using a spinning disk Yokogawa CSU-X1 unit integrated in Metamorph software by Gataca Systems equipped with an EMCCD camera and 40X (1.4 NA) oil objective, or Spinning disk Yokogawa CSU-W1 unit integrated in Metamorph software by Gataca Systems equipped with an sCMOS camera (Prime 95B (Photometrics)) and 40x CFI Plan Apo IR SR WI water objective. For time-lapse imaging of NLS probe leakage, images were taken every 5 min for 8h, 16-24h after treatment. A cell was considered to have undergone NE rupture when NLS-mCherry intensity dropped in the nucleus concomitantly with an increase in signal intensity in the cytosol. For time-lapse imaging of VPS4B-depleted cells, images were taken 48-72 h after transfection. For time-lapse imaging under CPT treatment, images were taken 8-24 h after treatment with 10 nM CPT. Image analysis was performed in ImageJ/Fiji software (NIH). For all time-lapse imaging relating to measurement of NE rupture monitoring cGAS-GFP, a nucleus was considered to have undergone NE rupture when appearance of perinuclear cGAS recruitment was observed. For all time-lapse imaging, only cells that remained alive and remained in frame for the whole duration of the experiment were considered for analysis. In addition, in Figure 4 A, cells that showed mitotic catastrophe at the end of their full cycle were excluded from analysis. In Figure S1 H, cells undergoing mitosis were excluded from analysis. Cells were counted positive if they have undergone at least one event of NE rupture during the period of observation. For 3D imaging, 81 Z-slices were obtained at 0.1 \u03bcM spacing, using Inverted Eclipse Ti-E (Nikon) microscope equipped with a stage-top incubator and CO 2 delivery system. Images were taken using spinning disk Yokogawa CSU-W1 unit integrated in Metamorph software by Gataca Systems equipped with an sCMOS camera (Prime 95B (Photometrics)) and 60x CFI Plan Apo IR SR WI water objective. 3D images were generated using 3D Viewer plugin in ImageJ/Fiji. Immunofluorescence Cells were seeded on glass coverslips 24 h before start of experiments. Cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs for 72 h and/or treated with indicated drugs for 24 h before fixation. Transfection was done using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Thermofisher) following the manufacturer`s instructions, with 11pM final siRNA concentration, except for siVPS4B #1, where 5.5 pM concentration was used. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS++ (1\u00d7 PBS, 1 mM CaCl 2 and 0.5 mM MgCl 2 ) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS++ for 20 min and blocked in staining buffer (3% BSA, 0.15% glycine and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS++) for 1 h at room temperature. After, samples were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies. After three washes with PBS++, samples were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibodies Alexa Fluor, ThermoFisher Scientific). Coverslips were washed again three times with PBS++ and mounted with ProLong\u2122 Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Imaging was performed with DeltaVision (Deconvolution) Image Restoration Microscope with SoftWorx software (GE Healthcare) or Apotome (Zeiss) Microscope, equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ2(Photometrics) camera and a motorized stage with Zen software (Zeiss). Images were taken using a 40x/1.3 NA oil-immersion objective with both microscopes. Image analysis was performed in ImageJ/Fiji software (NIH). A cell was counted positive for NE rupture if a clear break in Lamin B1 staining cooccurred with perinuclear cGAS recruitment, except Figure S7 C where Lamin B1 and DAPI staining was used for scoring. Concnetrations for drug treatments were determined according to the following table: Name Concentration 3-Deazaneplanocin-A (HMTi) 0.5 \u03bcM Aphidicolin (APH) 2 \u03bcM Bleomycin (Bleo) 1 \u03bcg/ml Camptothecin (CPT) 10/100/1000 nM CK-666 (Arp2/3i) 100 \u03bcM Etoposide (VP16) 1 \u03bcM FTI277 Indicated on graph KU55933 (ATMi) 10 \u03bcM Methylstat (HDMi) 2.5 \u03bcM Rabusertib/ LY260361 (Chk1) 1 \u03bcM Remodelin 10 \u03bcM Sapanisertib/INK-128 (mTORi) 200 nM Trichostatin A (HDACi) 100 nM VE-821 (ATRi) 5 \u03bcM/62.5 nM Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting Immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed from whole cell extracts, using RFP trap magnetic agarose beads (Chromotek), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All IP experiments were performed at 1 mg/mL protein concentration, at 4\u00b0C. IP samples were used for Western blotting (WB) or mass spectrometry (MS). For whole cell extracts, proteins were extracted using RIPA Buffer (300 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 1% NP-40). For IP experiments, RIPA was diluted to 150 mM NaCl concentration. Protein concentrations were evaluated with BCA Protein Assay (ThermoFisher). For WB, lysates were separated with 4\u201315% Mini-PROTEAN\u00ae TGX\u2122 Precast Protein Gels and 4\u201315% Criterion\u2122 TGX\u2122 Precast Midi Protein Gel (Biorad). Proteins were transferred to a Trans-Blot Turbo Midi 0.2 \u03bcm Nitrocellulose membrane with Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Biorad). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C and then with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit HRP (Amersham, NA934), sheep anti-mouse HRP (Amersham, NA9310)) for 1 h. Proteins were detected by ChemiDoc with Clarity\u2122 Western ECL Substrate (Biorad). Perinuclear fractionation Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, then resuspended in nucleus extraction buffer (10 mM Hepes PH 7.9; 10 mM KCl; 1,5 mM MgCl2; 0,34 M sucrose; 10% glycerol; 1 mM DTT; 0,1% Triton) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1300 g and the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected. The pellet (nuclei) was washed with ice cold PBS and centrifuged for 2 min at 500 g. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer B from Minute\u2122 Nuclear Envelope Protein Extraction Kit (Invent Biotechnologies Inc) diluted to \u00bd concentration in PBS. Tubes were centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min. Supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube and 0.8 ml of cold PBS was added. Tube was inverted about 10 times (this step precipitates the extracted nuclear envelope). Tubes were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube (nuclear fraction). Pellet (perinuclear fraction) was resuspended in RIPA 300 buffer (300 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 1% NP-40). Centrifugations were done at 4\u00b0C and samples kept on ice. All buffers were supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (PhosSTOP and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche). Proteomics and mass spectrometry analysis Proteome, phosphoproteome, and IP sample preparation For proteome and phosphoproteome sample preparation, 125\u03bcg of proteins from the perinuclear fractions were reduced with 5 mM DTT for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Reduced lysates were alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The samples were diluted in 200mM ammonium bicarbonate, 2 M urea to reach a final concentration of 1 M urea, and then digested overnight at 37 \u00b0C with Trypsin/Lys-C (Promega CAT#: V5071) at a ratio of 1/50. Digested peptide lysates were acidified with formic acid (FA) to a final concentration of 5% FA. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm and desalted onto a custom-made C18 StageTips, Phosphorylated peptides were eluted and 90 % of the starting material was enriched using Titansphere\u2122 Phos-TiO Kit (GL Sciences, Cat number 5010-21312) as described by the manufacturer. The remaining 10% were used for proteomes analyses. For IPs analysis, the beads were washed three times with 100 \u03bcL of 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 . Finally, beads were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of 25 mM NH4HCO 3 and digested by adding 0.2 \u03bcg of trypsin-LysC (Promega) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were then loaded into custom-made C18 StageTips packed by stacking three AttractSPE\u00ae disk (#SPE-Disks-Bio-C18-100.47.20 Affinisep) into a 200 \u03bcL micropipette tip for desalting. Peptides were eluted using a ratio of 40:60 CH 3 CN:H 2 O + 0.1% formic acid and vacuum concentrated to dryness with a SpeedVac apparatus. Peptides were reconstituted in 10\u03bcl of injection buffer in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) before liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Proteome, phosphoproteome, and IP analysis by LC-MS/MS Peptides for proteome analysis were separated by reversed phase liquid chromatograpgy (LC) on an RSLCnano system (Ultimate 3000, Thermo Scientific) coupled online to an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were trapped on a 2 cm nanoviper precolumn (i.d. 75 \u03bcm, C18 Acclaim PepMap\u2122 100, Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 3.0 \u03bcL/min with buffer A (2/98 MeCN/H2O in 0.1% formic acid) over 4 min to desalt and concentrate the samples. Separation was performed on a 50 cm nanoviper column (i.d. 75 \u03bcm, C18, Acclaim PepMap\u2122 RSLC, 2 \u03bcm, 100\u00c5, Thermo Scientific) regulated to a temperature of 50\u00b0C with a linear gradient from 2% to 30% buffer B (100% MeCN in 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over 211 min. MS1 data were collected in the Orbitrap (120,000 resolution; maximum injection time 60 ms; AGC 4 x 10 5 ). Charges states between 2 and 5 were required for MS2 analysis, and a 45 s dynamic exclusion window was used. MS2 scan were performed in the ion trap in rapid mode with HCD fragmentation (isolation window 1.2 Da; NCE 30%; maximum injection time 60 ms; AGC 10 4 ). For IPs and phosphoproteome analysis, LC was performed as previously with an RSLCnano system coupled online to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were trapped onto the C18 column with buffer A at a flow rate of 2.5 \u03bcl/min over 4 min. Separation was performed at a temperature of 50 \u00b0C with a linear gradient of 2% to 30% buffer B at a flow rate of 300 nl min \u22121 over 91 min. MS full scans were performed in the ultrahigh-field Orbitrap mass analyzer in the m/z range of 375\u20131500 with a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200, an AGC set at 300% and with a maximum injection time (IT) of 25 ms. The 20 most intense ions were isolated (isolation width of 1.6 m/z) and further fragmented via high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) activation and a resolution of 15,000, an AGC target value set to 100% and with a maximum IT of 60ms. We selected ions with charge state from 2+ to 6+ for screening. Normalized collision energy (NCE) was set at 30 and a dynamic exclusion of 40 seconds. Mass spectrometry data analysis For identification, the data were searched against the Homo Sapiens database (UP000005640_9606) using Sequest HT through Proteome Discoverer (version 2.4). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two missed cleavage sites were allowed. Oxidized methionine, N-terminal acetylation, methionine loss and methionine acetylation loss were set as variable modifications. Phospho serine, threonine and tyrosines were also set as variable modifications for phosphoproteomes analyses. Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions. For fragment ions, it was set respectively to 0.02 Da and 0.6 Da for the Orbitrap Exploris and the Orbitrap Eclipse data. The resulting files were further processed using myProMS (Poullet et al. 51 ;. https://github.com/bioinfo-pf-curie/myproms v.3.9.3 . False-discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using Percolator 52 and was set to 1% at the peptide level for the whole study. Label-free quantification was performed using peptide extracted ion chromatograms (XICs), computed with MassChroQ v.2.2.1. 53 For protein quantification, XICs from proteotypic peptides shared between compared conditions (TopN matching for proteome setting and simple ratios for phosphoproteome) with missed cleavages were used. Median and scale normalization at peptide level was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biological replicate (N=5). The phosphosite localization accuracy was estimated by using PhosphoRS 54 and phosphosite with a localization site probability greater than 75% were quantified at the peptide level. To estimate the significance of the change in protein abundance, a linear model (adjusted on peptides and biological replicates) was performed, and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR procedure. Phosphosites were retained under the criteria of at least a two-fold enrichment in sample comparisons one peptide across 3 biological replicates for Figure 2 D and 2 biological replicates for Figures 2 E and 2F. For Figure 2 D, GO term enrichment analysis was performed with myProMS, using Bonferroni multitest correction with a p-value threshold of 0.01 and an enrichment threshold of 2. For Figure 2 F GO term enrichment analysis was performed with ToppGene ( https://toppgene.cchmc.org/enrichment.jsp ), using probability density function, with a p-value threshold of 0.05. Visual representation and grouping of GO terms was created manually. Candidates or binding partners of WT Lamin A/C were selected with at least three total peptides in three replicates of a same state and a two-fold enrichment which must be statistically significant as reported by an adjusted p-value under 0.05. Unique proteins were considered with at least three total peptides in all replicates. All mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org ) via the PRIDE partner repository 55 with the dataset identifiers PXD040857 and PXD043990. Clonogenic survival assay Cells were transfected with siRNA in suspension and seeded at low concentration in a 6 well plates 48 h after transfection. Alternatively, cells were seeded directly at low concentration in a 6 well plate and treated with indicated drugs for 24 h. Colonies were fixed 10-12 days after seeding with Crystal Violet (Sigma) or Methylene Blue (Sigma) for 1-3 h at room temperature, washed with water and air-dried overnight and scored. Only colonies with more than 50 cells were considered when scoring. Percentage values were obtained by averaging survival at two different seeding densities for each condition in each experiment. MTT assay To determine cell proliferation, cells were seeded in technical duplicates in 96-well plates. At 36, 60 and 84 h after seeding, cells were treated with 50 \u03bcg/mL MTT for 2 h, then cells were washed and covered with 100 \u03bcL DMSO. Absorbance was measured immediately after, at 580 nm, using CLARIOstar Plus (BMG Labtech) plate reader, with SMART Control software (BMG Labtech). Data was extracted with SMART Control Analysis software (BMG Labtech). Measurements were blanked and the average of the duplicates was used for analysis. Cell cycle analysis Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and, when indicated, treated with drugs for 24 h before collection. Cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM EdU for 1h before collection. Cells were collected, washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL 0.1% BSA in PBS. To fix cells, 1.5 mL 70% ice cold ethanol was added to samples dropwise, while vortexing. Fixed samples were stored at 4\u00b0C for a minimum of 30 min (maximum 1 day). Next, cells were centrifuged and resuspend in 100 \u03bcL 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated for 20 min for permeabilization. Cells were washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in 100 \u03bcL fresh Click-it cockatil (2 mM CuSO 4 , 10 mM sodium-ascorbate, 1.8 \u03bcM AF647-Azide (Jena BioScience, CLK-1299) in PBS). After 30 min of incubation, cells were washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL fresh PI buffer (50 \u03bcg/mL Prpidium Iodide (Sigma), 500 \u03bcg/mL RNase (Sigma) in PBS) Cells were kept overnight (for maximum 1 week) at 4\u00b0C before analysis. Analysis was carried out using ZE5 Cell Analyzer (Bio-Rad) with Everest Software (Bio-Rad). Data was processed and graph were generated using FlowJo software (BD BioSciences). Displayed percentages on graphs were obtained by manual gating on AF647 over PI (as shown in Figure S4 B). Representative graphs in Figure S6 were generated using automatic cell cycle analyisis on FlowJo, based on PI histograms. Comet assay Alkaline comet assay was performed using Trevigen CometAssay\u00ae kit (4250-050-K) with Trevigen\u2019s CometAssay\u00ae ElectrophoresisSystem (4250-050-ES), following the manufacturer`s instructions. Images were analyzed with OpenComet plugin in ImageJ/Fiji software (NIH). Quantification and statistical analysis In all figures, error bars indicate SEM. For statistical analysis of imaging data, Chi-square test was used, pooling all data. For statistical analysis of survival data, two-tailed t-test was used. Statistical significance is represented on figures by asterisks, (\u2217 = p < 0.01, \u2217\u2217 = p < 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217 = p < 0.0001).

    "full_text_abstract": "Summary The integrity of the nuclear envelope (NE) is essential for maintaining the structural stability of the nucleus. Rupture of the NE has been frequently observed in cancer cells, especially in the context of mechanical challenges, such as physical confinement and migration. However, spontaneous NE rupture events, without any obvious physical challenges to the cell, have also been described. The molecular mechanism(s) of these spontaneous NE rupture events remain to be explored. Here, we show that DNA damage and subsequent ATR activation leads to NE rupture. Upon DNA damage, lamin A/C is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner, leading to changes in lamina assembly and, ultimately, NE rupture. In addition, we show that cancer cells with intrinsic DNA repair defects undergo frequent events of DNA-damage-induced NE rupture, which renders them extremely sensitive to further NE perturbations. Exploiting this NE vulnerability could provide a new angle to complement traditional, DNA-damage-based chemotherapy.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nHighlights \u2022 DNA damage leads to NE rupture \u2022 ATR activity promotes NE rupture through lamin A/C phosphorylation \u2022 HRD cells exhibit a targetable NE vulnerability\n\nHomologous-recombination-deficient (HRD) tumors often develop resistance to traditional chemotherapies, making them difficult to kill. Kovacs et al. find that HRD tumor cells exhibit DNA-damage-induced nuclear envelope (NE) rupture and subsequent NE vulnerability. Targeting this structural vulnerability could potentially provide a complement to traditional, DNA-damage-based chemotherapies."
