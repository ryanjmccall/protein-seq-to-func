    "abstract_text": "Src-family kinases (SFKs) regulate different granulocyte and monocyte/macrophage responses. Accumulating evidence suggests that members of this family are implicated in signal transduction pathways regulating phagocytic cell migration and recruitment into inflammatory sites. Macrophages with a genetic deficiency of SFKs display marked alterations in cytoskeleton dynamics, polarization and migration. This same phenotype is found in cells with either a lack of SFK substrates and/or interacting proteins such as Pyk2/FAK, c-Cbl and p190RhoGAP. Notably, SFKs and their downstream targets also regulate monocyte recruitment into inflammatory sites. Depending on the type of assay used, neutrophil migration in vitro may be either dependent on or independent of SFKs. Also neutrophil recruitment in in vivo models of inflammation may be regulated differently by SFKs depending on the tissue involved. In this review we will discuss possible mechanisms by which SFKs may regulate phagocytic cell migratory abilities.",
