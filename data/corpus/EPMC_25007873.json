    "abstract_text": "The function of TIMAP, an endothelial cell (EC)-predominant protein phosphatase 1-regulatory subunit, is poorly understood. We explored the potential role of TIMAP in the Akt-dependent regulation of glomerular EC proliferation, survival, and in vitro angiogenesis. To deplete TIMAP, the EC were transfected with TIMAP-specific or nonspecific small interfering (si) RNA. The rate of electrical impedance development across subconfluent EC monolayers, a measure of the time-dependent increase in EC number, was 93 \u00b1 2% lower in TIMAP-depleted than in control EC. This effect on cell proliferation was associated with reduced DNA synthesis and increased apoptosis: TIMAP silencing reduced 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation by 38 \u00b1 2% during the exponential phase of EC proliferation, and cleaved caspase 3 as well as caspase 3 activity increased in TIMAP-depleted relative to control cells. Furthermore, TIMAP depletion inhibited the formation of angiogenic sprouts by glomerular EC in three-dimensional culture. TIMAP depletion strongly diminished growth factor-stimulated Akt phosphorylation without altering ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a specific effect on the PI3K/Akt/PTEN pathway. Endogenous TIMAP and PTEN colocalized in EC and coimmunoprecipitated from EC lysates. The inhibitory PTEN phosphorylation on S370 was significantly reduced in TIMAP-depleted compared with control EC, while phosphorylation of PTEN on the S380/T382/T383 cluster remained unchanged. Finally, the PTEN inhibitor bpV(phen) fully reversed the suppressive effect of TIMAP depletion on Akt phosphorylation. The data indicate that in growing EC, TIMAP is necessary for Akt-dependent EC proliferation, survival, and angiogenic sprout formation and that this effect of TIMAP is mediated by inhibition of the tumor suppressor PTEN.",
