  "abstract_text": "Nuclear hormone receptors function as ligand activated transcription factors. Ligand binding and modification such as acetylation have been reported to regulate nuclear hormone receptors. The orphan receptors, Rev-erbalpha and Rev-erbbeta, are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and act as transcriptional repressors. In this study, the role of recruitment of co-factors by Rev-erbbeta and acetylation of Rev-erbbeta in modulating apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) transcription were investigated. Rev-erbbeta was found to transcriptionally repress apoCIII after binding to the apoCIII promoter. Tip60, a histone acetyl-transferase (HAT), was a novel binding partner for Rev-erbbeta and recruited to the apoCIII promoter by Rev-erbbeta. Tip60 was able to acetylate Rev-erbbeta and relieve the apoCIII repression mediated by Rev-erbbeta. This de-repression effect depended on acetylation of Rev-erbbeta at its RXKK motif by Tip60. In addition, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) interacted with Rev-erbbeta and was recruited to the apoCIII promoter by Rev-erbbeta to antagonize Tip60's activity. Taken together, we have provided evidence that Rev-erbbeta modulates the apoCIII gene expression by recruiting different transcription co-activator or co-repressor.",
