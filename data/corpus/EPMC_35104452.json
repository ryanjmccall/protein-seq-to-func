  "abstract_text": "p53, master transcriptional regulator of the genotoxic stress response, controls cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage. Here, we identify a p53-induced lncRNA suicidal PARP-1 cleavage enhancer (SPARCLE) adjacent to miR-34b/c required for p53-mediated apoptosis. SPARCLE is a ∼770-nt, nuclear lncRNA induced 1 day after DNA damage. Despite low expression (<16 copies/cell), SPARCLE deletion increases DNA repair and reduces DNA-damage-induced apoptosis as much as p53 deficiency, while its overexpression restores apoptosis in p53-deficient cells. SPARCLE does not alter gene expression. SPARCLE binds to PARP-1 with nanomolar affinity and causes apoptosis by acting as a caspase-3 cofactor for PARP-1 cleavage, which separates PARP-1's N-terminal (NT) DNA-binding domain from its catalytic domains. NT-PARP-1 inhibits DNA repair. Expressing NT-PARP-1 in SPARCLE-deficient cells increases unrepaired DNA damage and restores apoptosis after DNA damage. Thus, SPARCLE enhances p53-induced apoptosis by promoting PARP-1 cleavage, which interferes with DNA-damage repair.",
