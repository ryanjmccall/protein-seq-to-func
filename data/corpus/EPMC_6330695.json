  "title": "DNA sequence of the 5' flanking region of the human interleukin 2 gene: homologies with adult T-cell leukemia virus.",

  "abstract_text": "We previously reported the sequence of the gene for human interleukin 2 (IL-2) which included about 220 b.p. of the 5' flanking region. In this report we have extended the 5' sequence to 1263 b.p. before the start site of transcription and have compared the entire sequence of the IL-2 gene and its 5' flanking region with that of Adult T-cell leukemia virus (ATLV). Four regions of limited homology were noted. Three areas of homology to the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) were seen in the 5' sequence flanking IL-2. A fourth region of homology to the viral LTR was located within the second intron of the IL-2 gene. While the significance of these homologies is not known, it is possible that they are involved in regulating the expression of ATLV and IL-2, both of which are generally restricted to T cells.",
