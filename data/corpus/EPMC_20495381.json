    "abstract_text": "Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is essential in regulating integrin signaling pathways responsible for cell survival and proliferation, as well as motility, making FAK a distinctive target in the field of anticancer drug development, especially with regards to metastatic disease.(1) Our objective was to demonstrate tumor growth inhibition by PF-562,271, a selective inhibitor of FAK and FAK2, or Pyk2,(2) in mouse xenograft models, both subcutaneous and metastatic, employing the human prostate cancer cell line PC3M-luc-C6, a modified PC3M cell line that expresses luciferase. After 2 weeks of treatment with PF-562,271, 25 mg/kg PO BID 5x/wk, the subcutaneous model showed a 62% tumor growth inhibition compared to control based on tumor measurements (p < 0.05), with a 88% vs. a 490% increase in bioluminescent signal for treatment and control respectively (p < 0.05). In the metastasis model, the percent change from baseline, after 18 days of treatment, of the treatment group was 2,854 vs. 14,190% for the vehicle (p < 0.01). These results show that PF-562,271 has a potent effect on metastatic prostate cancer growth in vivo.",
