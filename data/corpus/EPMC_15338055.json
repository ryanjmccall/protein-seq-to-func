    "abstract_text": "The cellular response to the antitumor drug cisplatin is complex, and resistance is widespread. To gain insights into the global transcriptional response and mechanisms of resistance, we used microarrays to examine the fission yeast cell response to cisplatin. In two isogenic strains with differing drug sensitivity, cisplatin activated a stress response involving glutathione-S-transferase, heat shock, and recombinational repair genes. Genes required for proteasome-mediated protein degradation were up-regulated in the sensitive strain, whereas genes for DNA damage recognition/repair and for mitotic progression were induced in the resistant strain. The response to cisplatin overlaps in part with the responses to cadmium and the DNA-damaging agent methylmethane sulfonate. The different gene groups involved in the cellular response to cisplatin help the cells to tolerate and repair DNA damage and to overcome cell cycle blocks. These findings are discussed with respect to known cisplatin response pathways in human cells.",
