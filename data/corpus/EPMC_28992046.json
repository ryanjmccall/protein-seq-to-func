  "abstract_text": "Phosphorylation affects ubiquitination, stability, and activity of transcriptional factors, thus regulating various cellular functions. E2F transcriptional factor 1 (E2F1) regulates paternally expressed imprinted gene 10 (Peg10) expression, thereby promoting cell proliferation. However, the effect of E2F1 stability on Peg10 expression and the molecular regulation of E2F1 stability by its phosphorylation have not been well demonstrated. Here, we describe a new pathway in which phosphorylation of E2F1 by GSK3β increases E2F1 association with the deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11), which removes K63-linked ubiquitin chains thereby preventing E2F1 degradation in the nuclei. Downregulation of USP11 increases E2F1 ubiquitination and reduces E2F1 stability and protein levels, thereby decreasing Peg10 mRNA levels. Physiologically, USP11 depletion suppresses cell proliferation and wound healing in lung epithelial cells, and these effects are reversed by E2F1 and PEG10 overexpression. Thus, our study reveals a new molecular model that phosphorylation promotes substrate stability through increasing its association with a deubiquitinating enzyme. The data suggest that GSK3β and USP11 act in concert to modulate E2F1 abundance and PEG10 expression in lung epithelial cells to affect cell wound healing. This study provides new therapeutic targets to lessen lung injury by improving lung epithelial cell repair and remodeling after injury.",
