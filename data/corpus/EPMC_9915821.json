    "abstract_text": "The hepatitis B viral X protein (HBx) is known to exert its transactivation activity by the interaction with several cellular transcription factors. Here we report the interaction of HBx and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and their effects on the enhancer/promoters of hepatitis B virus (HBV). A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay showed that the cotransfection of HBx and C/EBPalpha strongly activated the enhancer II/pregenomic promoter of HBV in a synergistic manner. This effect was also observed in the heterologous expression system with promoters of SV40 and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase genes. Serial deletion analysis of the enhancer II/pregenomic promoter identified the responsible region (nucleotides 1639-1679), in which two C/EBP-binding sites are located. An in vitro interaction assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that HBx augmented the DNA binding activity of C/EBPalpha by direct interaction with it, and its basic leucine zipper domain was responsible for the interaction with HBx. Domain analysis of HBx showed that the central region (amino acids 78-103) was necessary for direct interaction with C/EBPalpha. However, the complete form of HBx was necessary for the synergistic activation of the HBV pregenomic promoter. These results suggest that the interaction of HBx and C/EBPalpha enhances the transcription of the HBV pregenomic promoter for the effective life cycle of HBV in hepatocytes.",
