Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106 , 10195\u201310200 ). The authors note that Figs. 1 F and 2 B appeared incorrectly: \u201cIn Fig. 1 F , the blot for N-D2 was inadvertently duplicated into the N-D1 panel. In Fig. 2 B , the p53 blot in the lower panel partially overlapped with the p53 blot in the upper panel. The errors occurred in figure assembly during our manuscript preparation.\u201d The authors used their original data to provide the corrected figures, which appear below. The online version has been corrected. Fig. 1. JFK is associated with the SCF complex and interacts with p53. ( A ) ( Left ) JFK is associated with Skp1, Cul1, and Rbx1 in vivo. U2OS cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-JFK or anti-Keap1 followed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-Skp1, -Cul1, -Rbx1, or -Cul3. ( Right ) F-box of JFK is required for its interaction with Skp1. U2OS cells were transfected with FLAG-JFK, FLAG-JFK\u0394F-box, or FLAG-JFK\u0394Kelch. Cellular extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG followed by immunoblotting with anti-Skp1 ( Upper ). Ten percent of input is shown ( Lower ). ( B ) JFK is associated with p53 in vivo. Lysates from U2OS cells stably expressing FLAG(3x)-JFK were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG. Bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide, resolved on NuPAGE 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gels were silver stained, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The identified peptides are listed. ( C ) The Kelch domain of JFK is required for its interaction with p53. H1299 cells were co-transfected with Myc-p53 and FLAG-JFK, FLAG-JFK\u0394Kelch, or FLAG-JFK\u0394F-box. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG ( Left ). Cellular extracts were also prepared from untransfected U2OS cells for co-immunoprecipitation assays with anti-p53 followed by immunoblotting with anti-JFK ( Right ). ( D ) JFK interacts with p53 in vitro. GST pull-down experiments were performed with GST-fused JFK or JFK mutants and in vitro transcribed/translated p53 ( Left ) or with GST-p53 and in vitro transcribed/translated JFK ( Right ). ( E ) Mapping the domain of p53 that is required for its interaction with JFK. H1299 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-JFK and Myc-tagged WT p53 or p53 deletion mutants. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. The schematic diagrams of p53 truncations and 10% inputs of these truncations are shown. ( F ) The interaction between JFK and p53 is independent of the interaction between JFK and Cul1/Skp1. U2OS cellular lysates with or without JFK siRNA treatment were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins. Fig. 2. JFK promotes p53 turnover via an SCF-dependent mechanism. ( A ) JFK destabilizes p53 protein. U2OS cells were transfected with JFK. Cellular extracts were prepared under no treatment or treatment with MG132 and analyzed by western blotting for protein expression with antibodies against the indicated proteins. ( B ) ( Upper ) p53 degradation is specific to JFK. U2OS cells were transfected with Myc-tagged JFK, Fbw7, \u03b2 -TrCP, or Skp2. Cellular extracts were prepared and western blotting was performed with anti-p53. ( Lower ) WT JFK but not JFK mutants promote p53 degradation. U2OS cells were transfected with FLAG-JFK, FLAG-JFK\u0394Kelch, or FLAG-JFK\u0394F-box. Cellular extracts were prepared and western blotting was performed with anti-p53. ( C ) JFK decreases the steady-state level of exogenous p53 protein. H1299 cells were co-transfected with a constant amount of p53 and increasing amounts of FLAG-JFK. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or MG132 for 6 h before cells were collected for western blotting analysis. ( D ) ( Left ) The destruction of p53 by JFK is mediated by an SCF complex. U2OS cells were transfected with JFK together with siRNAs for knocking down Cul1, Skp1, or Cdc20 as indicated. Cellular proteins were extracted for western blotting analysis with antibodies against the indicated proteins. ( Right ) JFK does not alter p53 mRNA levels. Total RNAs were extracted from the above-described U2OS cells and analyzed for p53 expression by real-time RT-PCR. The data were normalized to GAPDH . Each bar represents the mean \u00b1 SD for triplicate experiments. ( E ) JFK decreases p53 half-life. U2OS cells were transfected with vector or FLAG-JFK. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or MG132 for 6 h before addition of cycloheximide (CHX; 50 \u03bcg/mL). Cells were then harvested for western blotting analysis at the designated times after CHX treatment. Quantitation was done by densitometry and expressed as signals of p53/ \u03b2 -actin. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD for triplicate experiments."
