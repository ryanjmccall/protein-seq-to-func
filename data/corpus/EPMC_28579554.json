  "abstract_text": "Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is typically caused by mutations in genes of the extrinsic FAS mediated apoptotic pathway, but for about 30% of ALPS-like patients the genetic diagnosis is lacking. We analyzed 30 children with ALPS-like disease of unknown cause and identified two dominant gain-of-function mutations of the Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 3 (STAT3, p.R278H, p.M394T) leading to increased transcriptional activity. Hyperactivity of STAT3, a known repressor of FAS, was associated with decreased FAS-mediated apoptosis, mimicking ALPS caused by FAS mutations. Expression of BCL2 family proteins, further targets of STAT3 and regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, was disturbed. Cells with hyperactive STAT3 were consequently more resistant to intrinsic apoptotic stimuli and STAT3 inhibition alleviated this effect. Importantly, STAT3-mutant cells were more sensitive to death induced by the BCL2-inhibitor ABT-737 indicating a dependence on anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins and potential novel therapeutic options.",
