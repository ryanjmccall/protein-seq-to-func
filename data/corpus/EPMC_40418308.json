According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, kidney neoplasms encompass a spectrum of entities [ 2 ]. The most common are renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), which comprise clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), chromophobe RCC (chRCC), oncocytoma, and more [ 3 ]. RCC is a heterogeneous malignancy with unique histopathological, genetic, and molecular landscapes for each subtype [ 4 \u2013 7 ]. Most renal masses remain asymptomatic in their early stages. The classic clinical triad symptoms of flank pain, visible hematuria, and palpable abdominal mass are rare and typically indicative of aggressive histological characteristics, progressed disease stages, and unfavorable prognoses [ 8 , 9 ]. Consequently, the majority of RCCs are incidentally detected through non-invasive imaging while investigating non-specific symptoms or other abdominal ailments. Management of localized RCC primarily involves surgical interventions such as radical or partial nephrectomy, tumor ablation, and active surveillance [ 10 , 11 ]. In contrast, advanced or metastatic RCC is treated with targeted therapies including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), monoclonal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, along with immunotherapy by immune checkpoint inhibitors [ 12 ]. However, tumor heterogeneity remains a major challenge, emphasizing the need for personalized therapeutic approaches [ 13 \u2013 16 ]. RCC prognosis is influenced by anatomical, histological, clinical, and molecular factors. Anatomical factors are classified using the TNM staging system, which evaluates the primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastases [ 17 ]. Histological factors include tumor grade, RCC subtype, lymphovascular invasion, tumor necrosis, and collecting system invasion [ 18 \u2013 21 ]. Clinical factors primarily involve the performance status and local symptoms of patients. Additionally, molecular markers such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), VEGF, gene mutations, gene methylations, gene expression, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), functional proteins, and metabolites constitute an extensive field of scientific investigation [ 22 ]. Taken together, recent RCC research focuses on improving early detection and diagnosis, enhancing prognosis prediction, and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. In molecular biology, sequencing refers to determining the primary structure of unbranched biopolymers, DNA, RNA, and proteins, within the central dogma. This process generates a symbolic linear representation termed a sequence, which concisely captures the molecular structure at the atomic level and serves as the foundation for omics studies. The journey of sequencing began in 1953 when Watson and Crick established the double-helix structure of DNA [ 23 , 24 ]. A major breakthrough came in 1977 when Frederick Sanger developed the chain-termination method, now known as Sanger sequencing [ 25 ]. By 1986, the invention of DNA sequencing initiated a golden era in the evolution and refinement of sequencing platforms [ 26 , 27 ], culminating in the successful completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 [ 28 ]. In 2005, the advent of the first commercially available Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform revolutionized the field by enabling the massively parallel amplification and sequencing of millions of DNA fragments [ 29 ]. Two years later, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology emerged as the most valuable and widely employed tool for unraveling the complexities of human transcriptomics with the sequencing of the first expressed sequence tag library [ 30 ]. Further innovation arrived in 2009 with the introduction of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, ushering in a new era of progress in medicine and biology [ 31 ]. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, which provides average data, scRNA-seq enables unbiased, high-throughput, and high-resolution analyses of individual cells. This allows for the identification of novel cell types, states, dynamics, and developing trajectories in multi-omics aspects, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics [ 32 \u2013 34 ]. A new milestone was achieved in 2016 with the development of spatial RNA-seq to dissect RNA activities spatially, following by the introduction of spatial enhanced resolution omics-seq to unveil spatiotemporal transcriptomics, heralding the next generation of RNA-seq technologies [ 35 , 36 ]. However, a comprehensive systematic analysis or review of sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms remains conspicuously absent. Given the extensive knowledge structure and the abundant research papers in this field, we utilized bibliometric analysis to obtain objective and data-driven references for a comprehensive review. Bibliometrics is a quantitative analytical technique that leverages statistical and visualization tools to systematically examine research landscapes [ 37 \u2013 40 ]. In this study, we employed bibliometric methods to conduct an objective evaluation of research papers on sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms. This quantitative analysis was complemented by a thorough manual review of relevant literature, enabling us to provide a comprehensive overview of the knowledge structures, developmental trajectories, and key research hotspots within this rapidly evolving field. Materials and methods Data source and search strategy In our pursuit of understanding the evolution and focus of scientific contributions in sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms research, we initiated by consulting a limited amount of concerning papers. Given the extensive knowledge landscape and the sheer volume of research papers in this field, and in order to seek more quantitative and objective results as a reference, we assessed Web of Science (WoS) to conduct a comprehensive retrieval on July 3, 2023 with the retrieval strategy of ((TS = ((renal OR kidney) NEAR/2 (cancer* OR tumor* OR tumour* OR neoplasm* OR carcinoma* OR oncology))) AND ((TI = transcriptomic) OR (TI = proteome) OR (TI = proteomics) OR (TI = metabolomics) OR (TI = bioinformatics) OR (TI = metagenomics) OR (TI = metatranscriptomics) OR (TI = omics) OR (TI = microarray) OR (TI = sequence) OR (TI = RNA-seq) OR (TI = sequencing) OR (TI = ATAC-seq) OR (TI = single cell sequencing) OR (TI = single cell sequence) OR (TI = single cell RNA sequencing) OR (TI = single cell RNA sequence) OR (TI = expression profile) OR (TI = bioinformatic*) OR (TI = high throughput))). In the preliminary records, only those with the \u201carticle\u201d or \u201creview\u201d label were enrolled. Following that, to acquire thorough citation data, the remaining records were further restricted to the WoS Core Collection (WoSCC) database. Afterwards, the retrieved results were exported into a dataset that encompassed a wide array of bibliographical information, including affiliations, editors, abstracts, keywords, cited references, and funding details, as well as citation information such as authors, document title, document type, year of publication, source, source title, volume, issue, pages, citation count, and digital object identifier. Furthermore, these collected records were subsequently integrated into bibliometric tools for detailed statistical analysis and visualization. Bibliometric analysis The Bibliometrix package version 3.2.1 with R version 4.2.2 (Institute for Statistics and Mathematics, Vienna, Austria; www.r-project.org ) was primarily applied [ 41 ]. Additionally, we also employed VOSviewer v.1.6.15.0 (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands) and CiteSpace (5.8.R3), a visual knowledge graph bibliometric tool based on the Java language as supplementary and validation [ 42 , 43 ]. After extracting bibliographic and citation data from WoSCC records in text format, we imported them into bibliometric analysis, where we successively carried out the following analyses: overview analysis, source analysis, country and affiliation analyses, author analysis, citation analysis, publication and reference analyses, keyword analysis and thematic analysis. In particular, total citations (TCs), local citations (LCs), citation-based indices (H index, G index, and M index), Lotka\u2019s law, and Bradford\u2019s law, were utilized to quantify scientific output and evaluate research impact of journals and authors. Specifically, TCs measure global scholarly influence incorporating all possible citations worldwide, providing a broad assessment of a country\u2019s or author\u2019s or publication\u2019s international reach. LCs measure influence incorporating citations within a defined local dataset, limited to the specific literature corpus under study, highlighting its relevance or integration within a specific research field or curated dataset. Lotka\u2019s law suggests that the number of authors contributing n publications is about 1/ n 2 of those producing a single publication [ 44 ]. Bradford\u2019s law indicates that journals in a field can be divided into three parts, each with about one-third of all publications with the number ratio of 1: n : n 2 , corresponding to a core part of a few journals, a second part with more journals, and a third part with the bulk of journals [ 45 ]. Additionally, H index defines the number of papers with at least H citations, which M index adjusts the H index by the span of active publication years [ 46 ]. In addition, G index represents the unique largest number where the top G most cited publications collectively receive at least G 2 citations [ 47 ]. The integrated results of citation analysis, publication and reference analyses, keyword analysis, and thematic analysis were brought to the forefront of our attention. Based on them, we subsequently consulted substantial papers concerning sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms research to comprehensively review the development and hotspots in this field with conclusive schematic diagrams. Results Overview analysis The analytical flowchart was exhibited in Fig. 1 . In the present study, we initially retained 3758 records using the well-designed retrieval strategy. After removing 2358 records of other labels, we retained 1400 records. Further, excluding 140 records in other databases for lack of citation data, we ultimately received 1260 records from 509 sources by 8143 authors with 43,404 references in the WoSCC from 1960 to 2023. Referring to labels, they comprised 1116 articles, 2 articles (book chapter), 2 articles (data paper), 11 articles (early access), 23 articles (proceedings paper), 105 reviews, and 1 review (book chapter). The annual number of publications for sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms research from 1960 to 2023 was presented in Fig. 2 A. With an average of 6.98% annual growth rate, there were wave-like fluctuations in the developmental trend of annual publications, and a peak occurred recently in 2022 (133 publications, 10.56%). Moreover, the variation trend of the average article citations per year had two peaks emerged in 1984 (10.7) and 2012 (15.3), and more intriguingly, the average citations in 2023 appeared to be higher (Fig. 2 B). In addition, four three-field plots were drawn to display a variety of key references cited by multiple key countries (Figure S1A), affiliations (Figure S1B), authors (Figure S1C) and sources (Figure S1D) with a series of keywords.

China (379, 30.1%), the USA (314, 24.9%), Germany (89, 7.1%), Japan (52, 4.1%), and the United Kingdom (47, 3.7%) led the field, covering 69.9% of all publications. Moreover, the USA ranked first in TCs (global scholarly influence incorporating all possible citations worldwide) with 16,381, followed by the United Kingdom (8750), China (4734), Germany (2651), and Japan (1655) (Figure S2A). Notably, the United Kingdom had the highest average article citations (AACs) of 186.2. Furthermore, the country production and collaboration world map (Fig. 3 A) and network (Figure S2B) illustrated that China, the USA, Germany, United Kingdom, and Italy as central hubs for global collaboration. Specifically, the number of single-country publications (SCPs) and multiple-country publications (MCPs) of the top 20 most productive countries was visualized in a histogram (Fig. 3 B). China (MCP = 36, 9.5%), the USA (MCP = 79, 25.2%), Germany (MCP = 19, 21.3%), United Kingdom (MCP = 22, 46.8%), and Italy (MCP = 17, 37.0%), exhibited considerable levels of international collaboration. Notably, Japan and South Korea did not engage in any international cooperation. Additionally, Figure S2C displays the top 20 most productive affiliations. Among the 1881 affiliations contributing to sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Counseling Center ranked first with 54 publications. The affiliation collaboration network was depicted in Figure S2D, presenting the domestic and international collaborative relationships across various affiliations.

Altogether, the top 20 most productive authors submitted 231 publications, representing 18.3% of all. Among them, author TEH BT had the most publications of 20, the highest LCs (influence incorporating citations within a defined local dataset) of 127, the highest H index of 16, and G index of 20, while FUTREAL PA had the highest TCs of 8234 and FRAUNE C had the highest M index of 1.67. They all made significant contributions to the advancement of this scientific topic. Furthermore, author productivity analyzed by Lotka\u2019s law (the number of authors contributing n publications is about 1/ n 2 of those producing a single publication) and the top 20 most productive authors\u2019 production over time were respectively displayed in Fig. 4 A, B . TEH BT, as one of the most contributing and influential authors, was only active between 2001 and 2014. Nevertheless, SAUTER G had publications throughout the last two decades. Besides, the majority of key authors such as WANG J, WANG Y, SIMON R, BURANDT E, FRAUNE C, MINNER S, and STEURER S have been highly active over the past three years. Last but not least, the author collaboration network was demonstrated in Figure S3G to show the cooperation among these contributory authors.

B Keywords co-occurrence network for sequencing and omics study in kidney neoplasms research Thematic analysis Figure S7A demonstrated four quadrants of themes for sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms research. The upper right quadrant referred to motor themes, in which \u201cprognosis\u201d, \u201cclear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)\u201d, \u201cbioinformatics\u201d, \u201cdifferentially expressed genes (DEGs)\u201d, and \u201cmetastasis\u201d lied with both high density and high centrality, indicating that they were not only significant but also well-developed. Moreover, in the lower right quadrant, two nodes of basic themes were discovered, including \u201cimmunohistochemistry\u201d, \u201cmicroarray\u201d, \u201ctissue microarray (TMA)\u201d, \u201ckidney\u201d, and \u201cmiRNA\u201d, as well as \u201cproteomics\u201d, \u201cbiomarker\u201d, \u201ckidney cancer\u201d, \u201cmetabolomics\u201d, and \u201cmass spectrometry (MS)\u201d, uncovering their strong relevance but underdeveloped state in this field.

Last but not least, Figure S7B depicted the thematic evolution with the cutting points of years 2010 and 2020 to reveal the evolution of hot topics from 1960 to 2023 in this scientific area. Discussion The past decades have witnessed the giant development and remarkable evolution of sequencing technology. The sequencing of DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites has bestowed upon an expansive and multi-dimensional perspective of the human genetic landscape. This comprehensive view is collectively referred to as multi-omics, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Nonetheless, sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms have not been systematically analyzed or reviewed yet, presenting an enticing avenue for research exploration. In the present study, we obtained a dataset comprising a total of 1260 records from 509 distinct sources, authored by 8143 individuals, and featuring 43,404 references within the WoSCC, spanning the years from 1960 to 2023. The annual number of publications and cited frequencies have exhibited a consistent increase during this period, underscoring that sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms are arousing growing attention and have substantial developmental prospects and clinical relevance. In our country analysis, we found that China and the USA were at the forefront of research in this field, demonstrating robust collaboration with each other. Upon scrutinizing author-wise involvement, a cadre of noteworthy contributors were unveiled, including Teh BT, Sauter G, and Futreal PA, whose significant contributions have shaped this research landscape. Additionally, our journal analysis identified a series of influential journals, including PLoS One, Cancer Research, and New England Journal of Medicine, that actively participated in and substantially influenced this research field. Further, we conducted a thorough investigation of the results derived from publication and reference analyses, especially the historical citation and co-citation networks. Additionally, we took into account the results of keyword analysis and thematic analysis to compile a comprehensive assessment. These findings were subsequently integrated with the insights garnered from our meticulous review of substantial pertinent literature, providing a holistic perspective on the knowledge structures, developmental trends, and research hotspots within the realm of sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms. Specifically, three remarkable hotspots, \u201cexplore molecular mechanisms of RCC pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis\u201d, \u201cidentify molecular biomarkers of RCC for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics\u201d, and \u201cinvestigate tumor heterogeneity and tailor personalized therapeutic strategies for RCC\u201d, were summarized and discussed in detail as follows (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 Schematic diagram. The summarized three hotspots including \u201cexplore molecular mechanisms of RCC pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis\u201d, \u201cidentify molecular biomarkers of RCC for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics\u201d, and \u201cinvestigate tumor heterogeneity and tailor personalized therapeutic strategies for RCC\u201d were illustrated Explore molecular mechanisms of RCC pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis Genomics and epigenomics delve into the features and modifications of genome to indicate what is genetically possible. Transcriptomics, on the other hand, investigates the expression patterns of the transcriptome to suggest what is likely to occur. Proteomics, in turn, explores the characteristics of the proteome to figure out what makes it happen. Meanwhile, metabolomics monitors all metabolites and sheds light on what is happening within the body. Since the establishment of central dogma and the introduction of Sanger sequencing, sequencing and omics studies delving into the molecular mechanisms of RCC for pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis have ever been thriving [ 25 , 49 ]. As the most prevalent subtype, ccRCC is the primary focus for mechanistic exploration [ 50 ]. The tumor suppressor gene VHL was first identified in the last century, with mutations of VHL being recognized as key drivers of ccRCC pathogenesis [ 51 , 52 ]. Further research revealed that VHL protein (pVHL) functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting HIF [ 53 ]. As the key regulator of the hypoxic response, HIF orchestrates critical phenotypes of carcinogenesis including angiogenesis, energy metabolism, and apoptosis. pVHL mediates proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF1-a and HIF2-a, inhibiting HIF accumulation and thus hindering ccRCC development [ 54 ]. Advancements in sequencing technology have significantly expanded the genomic exploration of ccRCC. Notably, a systemic exome sequencing study revealed substantial genetic heterogeneity in ccRCC dominated by VHL mutations [ 55 ]. Specifically, the inactivation of two histone-modifying genes, SETD2 and KDM5C , contributed to a more comprehensive delineation of the somatic genetic landscape of ccRCC. Subsequent exome sequencing study identified the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex gene PBRM1 as another prevalent somatic genomic mutation gene in ccRCC [ 56 ]. Following that, BAP1 was also discovered by whole-genome and exome sequencing techniques as a tumor suppressor gene of ccRCC [ 57 ]. Not long afterwards, a genomic study implicated mTOR mutations and dysregulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in RCC pathogenesis by [ 58 ]. Collectively, the identification of VHL , SETD2 , KDM5C , PBRM1 , BAP1 , and mTOR mutations, along with their associated molecular mechanisms, has provided a comprehensive genomic atlas of ccRCC pathogenesis [ 6 , 7 ]. While genomic studies form the backbone of RCC molecular mechanism exploration, other omics and multi-omics approaches also play a crucial role. An initial transcriptomic investigation conducted functional annotation of a panel of DEGs screened using cDNA microarrays of ccRCC and pRCC [ 59 ]. Results showed that pathways such as cell adhesion, oxygen and radical metabolism might play a significant role in RCC development and progression. A following proteomic study portrayed the genetic shifts of RCC proteins, emphasizing the concurrent engagement of glycolytic and mitochondrial changes in the Warburg effect [ 60 ]. Further metabolomic profiling of paired ccRCC and normal tissue samples identified extensive alterations in central carbon metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, and antioxidant response features [ 61 ]. Notably, the up-regulation of metabolites in the glutathione and cysteine/methionine metabolism pathways was closely linked to ccRCC progression and metastasis. More recently, a comprehensive multi-omics study incorporating genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data elucidated the functional impact of genomic alterations in ccRCC [ 62 ]. Additionally, an integrated analysis combining genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics demonstrated a unique remodeling of cellular metabolism in ccRCC that might contribute to its recurrence [ 6 ]. Extensive multi-regional whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing work performed on tumors from localized and metastatic ccRCC patients enables a comprehensive description of tumor origin, ITH, evolution, and route to metastasis. This large-scale sequencing approach lays the foundation for precision clinical management. Notably, a series of recent genomic studies led by Turajlic S, known as the TRACERx Renal study, provided a comprehensive perspective of the pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis of ccRCC [ 63 \u2013 65 ]. These landmark investigations profoundly elucidated deterministic evolutionary trajectories shaping primary ccRCC growth, the fundamental genomic events driving primary ccRCC development, and the evolutionary route of primary ccRCC to progression and metastasis. While extensive research has predominantly focused on unraveling the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis of ccRCC, the past decade has also witnessed comprehensive investigations into other subtypes of RCC. In 2016, an unprecedented study integrated genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic methods to achieve a holistic molecular characterization of pRCC [ 66 ]. Remarkably, two molecular subtypes of pRCC were identified: type 1 pRCC was marked by alterations in the MET pathway, while type 2 pRCC was distinguished by activation of the NRF2-ARE pathway. Moreover, type 2 pRCC can be further classified into three molecular and phenotypic subtypes. Shortly thereafter, a thorough molecular characterization of RCC was performed across a substantial cohort of ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC patients [ 67 ]. This involved the integration of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, facilitating a holistic understanding of the molecular characteristics unique to each RCC subtype. These studies have yielded novel insights into pRCC and chRCC research. Additionally, NGS of RNA and exomes indicated novel RNA splicing partners and frequent of chromatin-remodeling gene mutations in a rare subtype, MITF/TFE translocation RCC (tRCC) [ 68 ]. A subsequent multi-omic analysis of tRCC further clarified its biological mechanisms [ 69 ]. Last but not least, the molecular landscapes of other rare RCC subtypes, including sarcomatoid and rhabdoid RCC, fumarate hydratase-deficient RCC, clear cell papillary RCC (ccpRCC) were also comprehensively delineated [ 70 \u2013 72 ]. Identify molecular biomarkers of RCC for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics As early as 1982, morphological parameters including cell arrangement, cell type, and nuclear grade were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of RCC [ 20 ]. RCC initially followed the Heidelberg classification, which was based on limited genetic knowledge and histological findings [ 73 ]. Accurate classification is crucial, as histopathological subtypes correlate with distinct clinical behaviors. However, relying solely on histopathology remains challenging due to overlapping microscopic characteristics among RCC subtypes. With advances in DNA microarray, TMA, multiple DNA and RNA sequencing technologies, MS, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), etc., the fields of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have facilitated the identification of novel molecular biomarkers for more precise diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of kidney cancer [ 74 \u2013 80 ]. Identify molecular biomarkers of RCC by transcriptomic studies Transcriptomics (also called functional genomics) mainly focuses on the intricate expression patterns of the transcriptome. This encompassed investigation of the various RNAs, including mRNAs and ncRNAs, produced within a biological system, to unveil what is likely to occur at the molecular level. By capturing the dynamic interplay of gene expression, transcriptomics offers valuable insights into how genes are activated or suppressed under different conditions. Identify molecular biomarkers of RCC by transcriptomic studies of mRNAs: Transcriptomic analysis of mRNAs has been widely employed to identify diagnostic and prognostic molecular biomarkers for RCCs. Early studies employed high-throughput TMA analysis via immunohistochemistry to determine DEGs identified through cDNA microarrays in RCC [ 81 ]. This unveiled distinct expression patterns of vimentin across various RCC subtypes, namely ccRCC, pRCC, chRCC, and oncocytoma, with a significant association between vimentin expression and poor prognosis. Further cDNA microarray studies demonstrated subtype-specific gene expression patterns, leading to the identification of novel molecular biomarkers with potential diagnostic significance, such as vimentin for ccRCC and parvalbumin for chRCC and oncocytoma [ 82 , 83 ]. Additionally, diagnostic panels of immunohistochemical markers, including beta defensin-1, parvalbumin, and vimentin derived from gene expression profiling studies using cDNA microarray exhibited prominent diagnostic specificity among various RCC subtypes [ 84 ]. Using microarray gene expression profiles, robust classification models for RCCs were also constructed [ 85 ]. Further, a more precise molecular classification was developed across ccRCC, pRCC, chRCC, oncocytoma, and angiomyolipoma by oligonucleotide microarray, identifying molecular biomarkers such as megalin/low-density lipoprotein-related protein 2, alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase, beta-defensin 1, and claudin 7 [ 86 ]. In addition, a study unveiled DEGs between aggressive and non-aggressive ccRCC patients to determine two distinct molecular forms of ccRCC, showing broad implications for diagnosis and prognosis [ 48 ]. Moreover, another research revealed vesicular transport and cell junction proteins as diagnostic biomarkers for chRCC and oncocytoma through mRNA expression profiles derived from oligonucleotide microarrays [ 87 ]. Beyond their diagnostic value, transcriptomic analyses using cDNA microarray profiles from primary tumors identified vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression as the most predictive marker for overall survival in metastatic RCC patients [ 88 ]. Furthermore, an oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a \u201cmetastatic gene signature\u201d in primary RCC, enabling metastasis prediction [ 89 ]. Additionally, DNA microarray profiling identified a set of molecular biomarkers capable of predicting conventional RCC patients\u2019 survival following surgery, independent of clinical prognostic factors [ 90 ]. Rare subtypes like tRCC were also investigated by microarray techniques to discern prognostic biomarkers including TRIM 63, glutathione S-transferase A1, and alanyl aminopeptidase [ 91 ]. Moreover, a comprehensive study combined genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics to explore the molecular characteristics of ccRCC further established novel associations among DNA methylation, gene mutation, copy number variation, and gene expression, enhancing clinical risk stratification [ 7 ]. More recently, a remarkable ccRCC study employed scRNA-seq technique to construct a comprehensive ccRCC TME atlas, revealing TREM2/APOE/C1Q-positive macrophage infiltration as a candidate prognostic biomarker for ccRCC recurrence and a promising therapeutic target [ 92 ]. Identify molecular biomarkers of RCC by transcriptomic studies of ncRNAs: NcRNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating mRNA stability and translation, impacting key processes in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, including inflammation, cell cycle regulation, stress response, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion [ 93 ]. This functional significance positions ncRNAs as promising candidates for molecular biomarkers and targeted therapies in cancer. Advances in miRNA microarray, RT-PCR techniques, and evolving whole-genome small RNA deep sequencing (smRNA-seq) have further expanded transcriptomic investigations into ncRNAs within kidney neoplasms research [ 94 , 95 ]. An early miRNA microarray identified significant down-regulation of miR-141 and miR-200c in both ccRCC and chRCC compared to normal kidney tissues [ 96 ]. Another study employing miRNA microarrays revealed a spectrum of differentially expressed miRNAs between ccRCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, suggesting their potential as biomarkers and contributors to carcinogenesis [ 97 ]. Subsequently, an investigation adopted smRNA-seq for the identification of novel miRNAs with considerable quantitative and qualitative accuracy, demonstrating a series of differentially expressed miRNAs with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications [ 98 ]. Identify molecular biomarkers of RCC by proteomic studies Proteomics explores the characteristics and functions of the proteome, aiming to unravel the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving biological processes. This approach is particularly valuable for identifying molecular biomarkers in RCC, facilitated by advancements in techniques for separating, quantifying, and identifying proteins and peptides, including TMA, protein chip arrays, MS, two-dimensional electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF\u2013MS), surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF\u2013MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) [ 74 , 76 , 79 , 99 \u2013 101 ]. Proteomic analysis complements transcriptomic studies by bridging gaps between mRNA and protein expression levels [ 102 ]. Moreover, it enables the study of diverse protein forms arising from mRNA splicing and post-translational modifications, which can significantly impact protein function without altering gene expression levels. Furthermore, proteomic research allows the direct exploration of multiple biological fluids, including tumor tissue, serum, and urine, facilitating the discovery of potential RCC biomarkers [ 103 ]. Early investigation using TMA of RCC tissue revealed differential expression patterns of cyclin D1, p27, and E were observed between RCC subtypes [ 104 ]. In addition, low cyclin D1 and p27 protein levels were significantly correlated with high nuclear grade, large tumor size, and unfavorable prognosis in conventional RCC patients. Another study utilized SELDI-TOF-MS-based proteomic analysis on serum samples to identify a panel of diagnostic biomarkers that could distinguish RCC patients from individuals with non-RCC diseases and healthy controls [ 105 ]. An additional investigation of the human urinary proteome utilized high-resolution MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS to map multiple proteins on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels [ 106 ]. Further research demonstrated a series of urine proteins with distinct expression patterns in ccRCC compared to adjacent non-malignant tissue, which also exhibited metabolic signatures through pathway analysis [ 107 ]. Moreover, a subsequent study using LC\u2013MS/MS delineated grade-dependent proteomic characteristics specific to ccRCC, highly represented by the glycolytic and amino acid synthetic pathways. Furthermore, a cutting-edge label-free quantitative proteomics method was developed to identify differentially expressed proteins and pathways between RCC and normal renal tissues, highlighting Coronin 1A and adipose differentiation-related protein as potential biomarkers [ 108 ]. Identify molecular biomarkers of RCC by metabolomic studies Metabolomics monitors all metabolites and offers insight into the biochemical activities within the body. By capturing the downstream changes from the genome, transcriptome, and proteome, it provides a comprehensive and dynamic molecular atlas [ 109 ]. Over the past decade, metabolomics, particularly the nontargeted measurement of small-molecular metabolites produced by the human body, has exhibited significant potential in biomarker identification and pharmacometabolomic research [ 110 ]. In pharmacometabolomics, metabolomic signature can be associated with specific therapeutic effects, paving the way for developing personalized therapies. This evolving field, which combines pattern recognition with metabolite identification, has been instrumental in the discovery of potential biomarkers across various renal diseases, including kidney cancer [ 111 ]. Metabolomic studies typically employ established techniques, including NMR, gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), along with MS, to separate and identify metabolites [ 80 , 112 \u2013 115 ]. The same biofluids used in proteomic research such as urine, serum, and tumor tissue are also commonly utilized in metabolomic studies, with urine being particularly suitable due to the anatomical proximity of kidney neoplasms to the urinary space [ 110 , 116 ]. Early metabolomic investigations utilizing a combination of hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometry (HiC-MS), reversed-phase ultra performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC-MS), and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) techniques enabled the detection of both lipophilic and hydrophilic metabolites present within the urinary metabolome of RCC patients [ 111 ]. A subsequent study extended the inquiry by using the HiC-MS approach to screen urine metabolomic profiles for molecular RCC biomarker [ 117 ]. Intriguingly, the findings indicated minimal disparity in the urinary metabolomic profiles before and after nephrectomy, implying that metabolic alterations linked with RCC persist despite the removal of the primary tumor. Further metabolomic investigation by NMR characterized a series of urinary biomarkers that constitute an excretory metabolic signature distinguishing RCC patients from normal controls [ 118 ]. Additionally, a more recent urine metabolomic study discovered a panel of metabolites, particularly N-formylkynurenine, that significantly differentiate RCC from non-RCC cases, highlighting the potential involvement of tryptophan metabolism as an essential pathway in RCC [ 119 ]. However, the urinary metabolome is highly susceptible to variability due to differences in sample collection and processing. Consequently, metabolomic study of other biofluids like serum and tumor tissue remain indispensable until standardized protocols for urine sample handling are established [ 116 ]. A comprehensive multi-matrix metabolomic analysis integrated urine, serum, and tumor tissue using GC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS to identify potential molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets in RCC [ 120 ]. Notably, it was revealed that serum metabolomics analysis provides a more accurate representation of tissue changes compared to urine. It also highlighted the role of tryptophan degradation, which yields anti-inflammatory metabolites, and proposed PPAR-\u03b1 antagonism as a promising therapeutic target in RCC. Moreover, a combined proteomic and metabolomic analysis of RCC tissues elucidated a significant grade-dependent metabolic reprogramming signature, supporting the exploration of anti-metabolic therapies in RCC [ 121 ]. Subsequently, a study introduced a diagnostic model based on a self-organizing map (SOM), which incorporated a cluster of seven metabolites derived from NMR-based serum metabolomic analysis [ 122 ]. This SOM model exhibited precise predictive capabilities in early diagnosis and provided reliable assessments of postoperative metabolic recovery for RCC patients. Additionally, another study utilizing NMR and GC\u2013MS approaches obtained potential metabolomic biomarkers in both RCC urine and serum samples, facilitating RCC diagnosis and staging [ 123 ]. Investigate tumor heterogeneity and tailor personalized therapeutic strategies for RCC Tumor heterogeneity, including inter-patient heterogeneity, intra-patient heterogeneity, and intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), could tamper with molecular biomarker applications and marker-based therapeutic strategies. Among these, ITH is the most fundamental concept in oncology and cancer research that characterizes the coexistence of diverse genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic features within a single neoplastic lesion [ 13 ]. It has become a pivotal consideration in the understanding of cancer pathogenesis, progression, relapse, and responses to clinical interventions [ 14 ]. This phenomenon underscores the substantial molecular, cellular, and functional variability that can exist within the same tumor entity. Subclonal cell populations may harbor distinct genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and expression patterns, leading to diverse biological behaviors and therapeutic responses [ 15 ]. A comprehensive understanding of ITH through multi-omic studies is essential for developing more effective and personalized approaches to RCC diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [ 16 ]. In 2012, a landmark study using multi-region sequencing illuminated the ITH and branched evolution of RCC [ 13 ]. This investigation involved exome sequencing, chromosome aberration analysis, and ploidy profiling across multiple spatially separated primary RCC samples and associated metastases. The results revealed that ITH within RCC could lead to an underestimation of the multi-omic landscape portrayed from single tumor-biopsy samples, thereby impeding the reliable identification of molecular biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targets. Moreover, ITH could facilitate tumor evolution and adaptation through Darwinian selection, potentially compromising tailored therapeutic strategies for RCC. A subsequent study conducted in 2014 further explored the genetic architecture and evolutionary trajectory of ccRCC through multi-region exome sequencing [ 124 ]. Existing results suggested that the majority of ccRCC driver aberrations exhibited subclonal features, with Chromosome 3p loss and VHL aberration being the only ubiquitous events. Moreover, an increased proportion of C > T transitions at CpG sites was observed during ccRCC progression. The inherent limitations of multi-omics studies based on microarray and bulk RNA-seq approaches can be partially mitigated through multi-region sample collection. However, the increased utilization of advanced scRNA-seq technology in cancer research offers a more comprehensive means to investigate the ITH within RCC [ 31 \u2013 34 ]. In 2016, a pioneer study using scRNA-seq in RCC research explored the ITH within a matched primary RCC and lung metastatic site pair [ 125 ]. The findings revealed significant variability in the activation of drug target pathways between the primary and metastatic sites, as well as among individual cancer cells within each site. Subsequently, researchers attempted to eliminate the majority of the drug-resistant subpopulation of metastatic cancer cells by simultaneously targeting two mutually exclusive pathways, which demonstrated a modest improvement in therapeutic efficacy. Another interesting study focusing on metabolomic profiling unveiled the ITH of RCC by delineating variations in pyruvate levels and metabolism across different tumor regions, which possibly constituted the vulnerabilities of RCC tumor cells [ 126 ]. These findings provided an alternative perspective on ITH within RCC and held the potential to shape innovative therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, an integrated genomic and transcriptomic study of ccRCC patients from a randomized phase III clinical trial identified four distinct molecular subgroups linked with TKI response and prognosis [ 127 ]. Notably, the differential characteristics of angiogenesis and immune microenvironment within these subgroups emerged as the key contributors, providing valuable insights for optimizing the precision treatment of RCC. Additionally, a recent scRNA-seq study successfully linked multi-regional immune landscapes and tissue-resident T cells in ccRCC with tumor topology and therapy efficacy [ 128 ]. This comprehensive analysis involved paired scRNA-seq and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of numerous cells derived from multiple tumor regions, lymph nodes, normal kidneys, and peripheral blood from two ICB-naive and four ICB-treated ccRCC patients. The findings showed extensive inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity, characterized by an abundance of CD8A(+) tissue-resident T cells in an ICB-responsive patient and an enrichment of tumor-associated macrophages in an ICB-resistant one. In addition, a TCR trajectory framework uncovered distinct T cell differentiation pathways between ccRCC patients responsive to and resistant to ICB therapy. Nonetheless, our study does have certain limitations. First, our data was sourced exclusively from the WoSCC database, which could result in an incomplete collection of relevant publications in sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms research landscape. Second, while the database is regularly updated, we only obtained publications up to July 3, 2023, which will exclude the latest research. Third, due to the constraints within the WoS retrieval system, it was challenging to achieve a perfect balance between accuracy and completeness in our search strategy, resulting in the inclusion of some irrelevant publications and the omission of potentially relevant ones. Fourth, certain recent publications that haven\u2019t yet gained widespread attention may not have been fully captured in our study. However, we made substantial efforts to manually review as many papers as possible to mitigate these limitations. Despite these challenges, our study offers a comprehensive review of the knowledge structure, developing trends, and hotspots within sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms research. Conclusion In the present study, we obtained deep insights into the knowledge structure, evolving trends, and hotspots of research investigating sequencing and omics studies by bibliometric analysis. The summarized three hotspots were \u201cexplore molecular mechanisms of RCC pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis\u201d, \u201cidentify molecular biomarkers of RCC for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics\u201d, and \u201cinvestigate tumor heterogeneity and tailor personalized therapeutic strategies for RCC\u201d. This research field is rapidly developing, and hopefully our study will provide a valuable reference for scientific researchers and clinical practitioners.

    "full_text_abstract": "Background Kidney cancer is a worldwide prevalent urological malignancy and the leading cause of death. Sequencing and omics studies play a crucial role in unraveling its molecular mechanisms and diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance. This study aims to offer a comprehensive review of the evolving trends and hotspots of sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms. Methods We conducted the retrieval of scientific publications on sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) on July 3, 2023. The R-based bibliometrix package, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace were utilized to conduct the holistic bibliometric analysis to obtain objective and data-driven results. A comprehensive consultation of papers was then proceeded for an in-depth review. Results Our investigation yielded a dataset containing 1260 records from 509 sources, with 43,404 references, from 1960 to 2023. Publication and citation frequencies have been consistently growing. In country analysis, China and the USA led the research, displaying substantial collaboration. Notable contributors like TEH BT, SAUTER G, and FUTREAL PA shaped this research landscape. Key journals such as PLoS One, Cancer Research, and New England Journal of Medicine actively participated in and significantly influenced this field. Distinguished publications and references were also revealed, along with their historical citation and co-citation relationships. A panel of keywords, including RCC, biomarker, and multi-omics data were identified and clustered. Conclusion We obtained a profound understanding of the developing trends and hotspots of research investigating sequencing and omics studies in kidney neoplasms. Specifically, we have highlighted three hotspots: \u201cexplore molecular mechanisms of RCC pathogenesis, progression, and metastasis\u201d, \u201cidentify molecular biomarkers of RCC for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics\u201d, \u201cinvestigate tumor heterogeneity and tailor personalized therapeutic strategies for RCC\u201d. Hopefully, our study will serve as a valuable reference for scientific researchers and clinical practitioners.
