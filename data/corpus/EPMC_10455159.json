    "abstract_text": "14-3-3 proteins are intracellular, dimeric molecules that bind to and modify the activity of several signaling proteins. We used human 14-3-3zeta as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a murine embryonic cDNA library. One interacting clone was found to encode the carboxyl terminus of a putative protein kinase. The coding sequence of the human form (protein kinase Ualpha, PKUalpha) of this protein kinase was found in GenBank(TM) on the basis of sequence homology. The two-hybrid clone was also highly homologous to TOUSLED, an Arabidopsis thaliana protein kinase that is required for normal flower and leaf development. PKUalpha has been found by coimmunoprecipitation to bind to 14-3-3zeta in vivo. Our confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopic experiments revealed that PKUalpha colocalizes with the cytoplasmic intermediate filament system of cultured fibroblasts in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. PKUalpha is found in the perinuclear area of S phase cells and in the nucleus of late G(2) cells. Transfection of cells with a dominant negative form of 14-3-3eta promotes the nuclear localization of PKUalpha. These results suggest that the subcellular localization of PKUalpha is regulated, at least in part, by its association with 14-3-3.",
