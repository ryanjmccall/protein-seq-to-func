  "abstract_text": "We have studied the genetic alterations acquired during selection of a cloned human leukaemic cell line (CEM/VP-1) that is 15-fold more resistant to the anticancer topoisomerase II-inhibitor etoposide than parental CCRF-CEM cells. CEM/VP-1 cells exhibit an 'atypical MDR' phenotype: cross resistance to other topo II inhibitors (but not Vinca alkaloids) and expression of a drug-resistant topo II activity. Cytogenetic and molecular studies revealed that the cell line carried multiple genetic changes affecting TOP2 genes encoding both topo II alpha and beta isoforms. CEM/VP-1 was diploid, 47,XX,+20, and appears to have been preferentially selected from a 1% diploid subpopulation present in the tetraploid parental cells. The same chromosomal abnormalities were present in resistant and sensitive cells except for an acquired 3p- change most likely deleting one TOP2 beta allele. PCR/DNA sequence analysis and allele-specific hybridisation showed that one of two TOP2 alpha alleles expressed in CEM/VP-1 cells had acquired a Lys-797-->Asn codon change. This mutation lies close to the catalytic Tyr-804 residue of the protein and may interfere with drug-induced trapping of the cleavable complex. Alternatively, it could exert a loss of function phenotype. CEM/VP-1 cells did not exhibit codon 449 or 486 TOP2 alpha mutations in the ATP binding domain reported in two other resistant cell lines. Diploid selection and multiple changes observed in CEM/VP-1 cells appear to be consequences of the recessive phenotype of at-MDR. These results may be useful in approaching the mechanisms of clinical resistance.",
