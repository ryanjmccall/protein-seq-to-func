    "abstract_text": "The gene for the androgen receptor, mutations at which cause the X-linked androgen insensitivity syndrome, has been localized to the q11----q12 region of the human X chromosome by analysis, using a cloned cDNA for the androgen receptor, of somatic cell hybrid panels segregating portions of the X chromosome. A moderate-frequency HindIII RFLP has been found which should be useful in genetic linkage analysis of the various inherited forms of androgen insensitivity.",
