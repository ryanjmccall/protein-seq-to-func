  "abstract_text": "The death receptor Fas undergoes a variety of post-translational modifications including S-palmitoylation. This protein acylation has been reported essential for an optimal cell death signaling by allowing both a proper Fas localization in cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched membrane nanodomains, as well as Fas high-molecular weight complexes. In human, S-palmitoylation is controlled by 23 members of the DHHC family through their palmitoyl acyltransferase activity. In order to better understand the role of this post-translational modification in the regulation of the Fas-mediated apoptosis pathway, we performed a screen that allowed the identification of DHHC7 as a Fas-palmitoylating enzyme. Indeed, modifying DHHC7 expression by specific silencing or overexpression, respectively, reduces or enhances Fas palmitoylation and DHHC7 co-immunoprecipitates with Fas. At a functional level, DHHC7-mediated palmitoylation of Fas allows a proper Fas expression level by preventing its degradation through the lysosomes. Indeed, the decrease of Fas expression obtained upon loss of Fas palmitoylation can be restored by inhibiting the lysosomal degradation pathway. We describe the modification of Fas by palmitoylation as a novel mechanism for the regulation of Fas expression through its ability to circumvent its degradation by lysosomal proteolysis.",
