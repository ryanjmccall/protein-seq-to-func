  "abstract_text": "High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an important chromatin protein and a pro-inflammatory molecule. Though shown to enhance target DNA binding by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic switch protein ZEBRA, whether HMGB1 actually contributes to gammaherpesvirus biology is not known. In investigating the contribution of HMGB1 to the lytic phase of EBV, important for development of EBV-mediated diseases, we find that compared to latently-infected cells, lytic phase Burkitt lymphoma-derived cells and peripheral blood lytic cells during primary EBV infection express high levels of HMGB1. Our experiments place HMGB1 upstream of ZEBRA and reveal that HMGB1, through the NLRP3 inflammasome, sustains the expression of ZEBRA. These findings indicate that in addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome's recently discovered role in turning the EBV lytic switch on, NLRP3 cooperates with the danger molecule HMGB1 to also maintain ZEBRA expression, thereby sustaining the lytic signal.",
