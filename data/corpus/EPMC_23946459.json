    "title": "Role of herpes simplex virus VP11/12 tyrosine-based motifs in binding and activation of the Src family kinase Lck and recruitment of p85, Grb2, and Shc.",

    "abstract_text": "Previous studies have shown that the abundant herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein VP11/12, encoded by gene UL46, stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt signaling: it binds the Src family kinase (SFK) Lck, is tyrosine phosphorylated, recruits the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase, and is essential for the activation of Akt during HSV-1 infection. The C-terminal region of VP11/12 contains tyrosine-based motifs predicted to bind the SH2 domains of SFKs (YETV and YEEI), p85 (YTHM), and Grb2 (YENV) and the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of Shc (NPLY). We inactivated each of these motifs in the context of the intact viral genome and examined effects on binding and activation of Lck and recruitment of p85, Grb2, and Shc. Inactivating the p85, Grb2, or Shc motif reduced (p85) or eliminated (Grb2 and Shc) the interaction with the cognate signaling molecule without greatly affecting the other interactions or activation of Lck. Inactivating either SFK motif had only a minor effect on Lck binding and little or no effect on recruitment of p85, Grb2, or Shc. In contrast, inactivation of both SFK motifs severely reduced Lck binding and activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of VP11/12 and reduced (p85) or eliminated (Grb2 and Shc) binding of other signaling proteins. Overall, these data demonstrate the key redundant roles of the VP11/12 SFK-binding motifs in the recruitment and activation of SFKs and indicate that activated SFKs then lead (directly or indirectly) to phosphorylation of the additional motifs involved in recruiting p85, Grb2, and Shc. Thus, VP11/12 appears to mimic an activated growth factor receptor.",
