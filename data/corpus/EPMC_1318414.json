  "abstract_text": "We have asked how the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early 1 (IE1) and 2 (IE2) proteins act to transactivate heterologous cellular and viral promoters. Here we show that transactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat and the 70,000-molecular-weight heat shock protein (hsp70) promoter by IE1 is TATA box independent and that the IE1 protein does not interact directly with the TATA box-binding factor TFIID. Conversely, transactivation of these promoters by IE2 is TATA box dependent and a direct interaction between IE2 and TFIID occurs, suggesting that IE2 transactivation is mediated through interaction with TFIID.",
