  "abstract_text": "A cDNA clone encoding amino acids 809-1451 of the protease inhibitor alpha 2-macroglobulin has been isolated from an adult human liver cDNA library. This cDNA was used to examine DNA samples prepared from a panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids with different numbers and combinations of human chromosomes for the presence of the human alpha 2-macroglobulin gene. The cosegregation of this gene and chromosome 12 in the cell hybrid panel indicated that the alpha 2-macroglobulin structural gene (designated A2M) is on human chromosome 12.",
