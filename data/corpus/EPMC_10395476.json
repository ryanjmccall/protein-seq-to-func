  "abstract_text": "Previous efforts in the search for molecules capable of blocking the associations between the activated tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and the SH2 domain of Grb2 had resulted in the identification of 3-amino-Z-pTyr-Ac6c-Asn-NH2, a high-affinity and selective antagonist of this SH2 domain. In the present paper, we report the successful replacement of asparagine in this compound by a beta-amino acid mimetic, which brings us closer to our objective of identifying a Grb2-SH2 antagonist suitable for pharmacological investigations.",
