    "abstract_text": "1. The biphasic nature of the potent modulatory action of interleukin-2 (IL-2) on hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release was investigated by use of brain slice superfusion. 2. Both the potentiating (10(-13) M) and inhibitory (10(-9) M) effects of IL-2 on hippocampal ACh release were stimulation-dependent and were blocked by a neutralizing IL-2 receptor antibody, suggesting the activation of typical IL-2 receptors in both cases. 3. Tetrodotoxin (TTX: 10 microM) failed to block the potentiation of ACh release induced by a very low concentration of IL-2 (10(-13) M) suggesting a direct effect on cholinergic nerve terminals. 4. In contrast, the inhibitory effect seen at a higher concentration (10(-9) M) was TTX-sensitive, and hence indicative of an indirect action. 5. To establish the nature of this intermediate mediator, blockers of nitric oxide synthesis, and of opioid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were used. Only GABAA and GABAB receptor antagonists altered the inhibitory action of IL-2, suggesting the participation of GABA as mediator. 6. Taken together, these results provide further evidence for the potent role of IL-2 in the modulation of cholinergic function in the rat hippocampus.",
