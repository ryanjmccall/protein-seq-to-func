Introduction Breast cancer is one of the major fatal malignancies among the population worldwide. In 2022, the Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) recorded approximately 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer in all sexes, and specifically in women of all ages (Bray et al. 2024 ). In 2022, there were approximately 11.0 deaths per 100,000 from breast cancer in the Iranian population, despite a relatively low prevalence rate compared with that in advanced countries. The increased mortality rate among the Iranian population seems to be due mainly to delays in diagnosis (Foroozani et al. 2020 ). Unfortunately, the new cases are mostly young individuals (Ataeinia et al. 2021 ), with a relatively high prevalence rate of the disease in the central provinces of Iran (Soleimani et al. 2023 ). Breast cancer is a multifactorial disorder influenced by both genetic and nongenetic factors. Recent investigations into its molecular pathogenesis have highlighted the fundamental role of genetic factors, especially those regulating cellular growth and cycle, in disease development (Torabi Dalivandan et al. 2021 ). With the advancement and increasing accessibility of molecular techniques, considerable efforts by Iranian scientists over the past decade have focused on the identification of cellular growth and cell cycle regulatory markers associated with breast cancer in the Iranian population. The objective of this review is to synthesize and consolidate findings from investigations conducted over the last five years, with the aim of presenting a comprehensive list of genes involved in cellular growth and cell cycle regulation that hold significant potential as molecular markers for the diagnosis of breast cancer in the Iranian population (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Cellular markers associated with breast cancer in the Iranian population Representation of cellular growth and cell cycle regulatory markers which has been investigated over the past five years in the Iranian population. The most common studied gene markers related to breast cancer in Iranian patients are shown within the red circle. Please see the main text and Table 5 for more information. Methods Search strategy We conducted a literature search in international and Iranian databases, including PubMed ( https://www.Pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ), Scopus ( https://www.scopus.com/ ) , IranMedex ( https://www.iranmedex.com/ ), and Magiran ( https://www.Magiran.com/ ), regarding the associations between cellular growth and cell cycle regulation, as well as genetic markers and breast cancer in Iran from 2019 until now. In the first stage, the keywords \u201cgene\u201d, \u201cgenetics\u201d, \u201cmutation\u201d, \u201cCellular growth\u201d, \u201cCell cycle\u201d, and \u201cbreast cancer\u201d were searched in the titles. Study selection In this review, we evaluated studies investigating the genetic factors contributing to the development of breast cancer in the Iranian population. Subsequently, we extended the search to identify gene markers reported in other populations worldwide. Key findings were synthesized based on statistical significance and study frequency. Then a gene panel most strongly associated with breast cancer in the Iranian population was compiled. Inclusion criteria Studies were considered eligible if they met all of the following criteria: (i) Conducted on human participants within the Iranian population, (ii) Focused on breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, or susceptibility, (iii) Investigated molecular markers related to cell growth and/or cell cycle regulation, (iv) Classified as original research, review, meta-analysis, or in silico study, (v) Published in peer-reviewed journals with a recognized impact factor (generally > 2.5). Relevant regional journals with slightly lower impact factors were also considered due to their significance to the Iranian population. (vi) Published between January 2019 and December 2024, (vii) Available in English or Persian. Exclusion criteria Studies were excluded if they met any of the following conditions: (i) Conducted on non-Iranian population or animal models, (ii) Lacked direct evaluation of molecular markers related to cell growth or cell cycle regulation, (iii) Case reports, conference abstracts, editorials, letters, commentaries, theses/dissertations, or unpublished manuscripts, (iv) None-peer reviewed sources, publications in journals without recognized scientific indexing, or lacking sufficient methodological detail, (v) Published before January 2019 or after December 2024, (vi) Articles not available in English or Persian. Kinases and growth factors Kinases and growth factors are central regulators of cellular growth and differentiation. When their pathways become constitutively activated, they can trigger a cascade of molecular events that drive cancer development. Her2 (ErbB2) One of the best-studied growth factor receptors is HER2 (erythroblastic oncogene B, ErbB2), a cell surface receptor protein that belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (Hynes and Lane 2005 ). HER2 plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression, and several investigations among Iranian populations have explored its oncogenic potential. For example, one study in a subpopulation from Iran showed that the expression of the HER2 receptor was elevated in bone, brain, and lung tissues, the primary metastatic sites of breast cancer. Luminal A and B subtypes were particularly prone to bone metastasis (Hashemi-Bahremani et al. 2020 ). Another study found a strong association between HER2/neu gene amplification and lymph node involvement as well as higher histological grades of breast tumours (Isaee et al. 2024 ). Further evidence from a retrospective study of 276 metastatic breast cancer patients in Shiraz, Iran, highlighted distinct patterns of metastasis depending on receptor subtypes (Jafari et al. 2022 ). HER2-enriched, luminal A, luminal B, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes exhibited significantly different frequencies of metastasis to bone, brain, lung, and liver. Notably, luminal A and B subtypes showed higher rates of bone metastasis as the initial metastatic site, while receptor expression also varied liver metastasis size. These findings underscore the importance of receptor profiling in predicting metastatic behaviour and tailoring patient management. HER3 Another member of the HER family, epidermal growth factor 3 (HER3), has also been linked to breast cancer metastasis. An Iranian study reported that abnormal HER3 expression, particularly when co-expressed with ROR1 (a receptor tyrosine kinase), correlated strongly with lymph node invasion, distant metastasis, and co-expression of HER2, ER, PR, P53, and Ki67 biomarkers. Together, these findings suggest that HER3 contributes to metastatic progression, often in conjunction with HER2 and other regulatory markers (Hassanzadeh Makoui et al. 2024 ). Obesity-associated factors: FTO Beyond kinases and growth factors, metabolic dysregulation also plays a role in breast cancer progression. The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene has been implicated in multiple cancers, including breast cancer (Kaklamani et al. 2011 ). In Iranian populations, the SNP FTO/rs9939609 was significantly associated with breast cancer risk among overweight females (Gholamalizadeh et al. 2021 ). This variant also interacts with lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity, macronutrient intake, and alcohol consumption (Doaei et al. 2021 ). Importantly, it may neutralize the protective effects of vitamin D against breast cancer. Additional studies found that the rs9939609 variant was more frequent among HER2-negative patients (Montazeri et al. 2022 ). Another study reported that FTO gene variants were associated with breast cancer, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Hesari et al. 2019a ). Collectively, these findings highlight the diagnostic potential of FTO variants in predicting breast cancer risk. Carcinogenic metabolism genes: CYPs and GSTP1 The cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes encode cytochrome P450 proteins, including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP19A1 and GSTP1. These enzymes are involved in decreasing the carcinogenic effects of environmental chemicals (Nebert and Dalton 2006 ). Polymorphisms in these genes could increase breast cancer susceptibility. Researchers have examined the associations between variations in these genes and breast cancer susceptibility in the Iranian population in several investigations (Golmohammadzadeh et al. 2019 ). In a case\u2013control study of 400 cases, researchers showed that GG genotype of CYP1A2-rs17861162 SNP and TT genotype of ADSL-rs3788579 SNP could significantly be associated with breast cancer in the North-West of Iran (Valizadeh Osalo et al. 2024 ). In a case\u2012control study of 200 individuals, researchers reported the associations of GSTP1 (rs1695) with the risk of disease among Iranian women with breast cancer (Farmohammadi et al. 2020 ). Researchers have hypothesized that variations in these genes and the serum levels of pesticides could contribute to breast cancer susceptibility based on the above enzymes in breast cancer. CYP19A1 (rs10046) gene polymorphisms with C\u2013C/C\u2013C and C\u2013C/C-T genotypes are strongly associated with breast cancer susceptibility in the Iranian population (Alwan et al. 2021 ). VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3 Nutrigenomics research has shown that diet plays an important role in cancer development. A westernized diet (high intake of meats, processed meats, sauces, fast food, and alcohol) seems to increase carcinogenesis through different mechanisms, including insulin resistance and decreased estrogen excretion (Lathigara et al. 2023 ). Several investigations in the Iranian population have focused on the role of Nutri-genomics in connection with breast cancer susceptibility. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which is activated by low levels of oxygen in the cell, can activate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Favaro et al. 2011 ). The subsequent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3), which is a downstream effector, promotes aberrant vascularization with altered perfusion (angiogenesis) and the initiation of carcinogenesis, such as that of breast cancer (Li et al. 2023 ). Breast cancer patients who adhered to a healthy eating habit, which involved consuming high quantities of fruits, vegetables, vegetable oils, legumes, spices, nuts, and grains, seafood, low-fat meat, skinless poultry, whole bread, and low-fat dairy products, experienced a significant decrease in the expression levels of VEGF-A, PPAR-\u03b3, and HIF-1\u03b1, which are nutritional genes (Asemani et al. 2020 ). These findings indicate that healthy eating can inhibit the pathological transformation of benign breast disease (BBD) to its malignant form. In primary breast cancer patients who consume dietary protein, lymphatic and vascular metastasis may be associated with RhoA and VEGF-VEGFR2 overexpression (Shokri et al. 2019 ). Pro-metastatic genes: ROCK, CLDNs, and CTTN Metastasis-related genes such as Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), claudins (CLDN), and cortactin (CTTN) regulate cell motility and epithelial cell\u2012cell junction integrity (Beaty and Condeelis 2014 ). Ras homologous gene family member A (RhoA), a pro-metastatic gene, increases cellular motility (O\u2019Connor and Chen 2013 ). In a study involving 206 individuals with breast cancer, researchers examined the relationships between the expression levels of pro-metastatic genes (ROCK, CTTN, CLND1, and CLND-4) and clinicopathological features in nonmetastatic eligible patients with breast cancer (Mazloomi et al. 2021 ). The results revealed a positive correlation between the expression of the CTTN, CLDN-1, and CLDN-4 genes and tumour size and between the expression of the CLDN-4 gene and tumour grade. The overexpression of ROCK was associated with metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. Another study on 215 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer showed that a healthy diet could prevent the metastasis of primary breast cancer (Foroutan-Ghaznavi et al. 2022 ). Dietary protein intake has also been linked to increased metastasis via enhanced angiogenesis (Medina and Quesada 2014 ). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as a angiogenic factor, functions in tumour progression (Liu et al. 2011 ). Researchers conducted a study on 177 primary diagnosed specimens to measure the expression levels of Rho A, VEGF, and VEGFR and investigate their relationship with lymphatic and vascular metastasis of the tumour (Shokri et al. 2019 ). The results revealed a significant association between the overexpression of VEGFR2 in patients with axillary lymph node metastasis. A positive correlation was detected between RhoA expression and estrogen receptor-positive and vascular metastasis in primary breast cancer patients who consumed dietary protein. Furthermore, a study reported that the upregulation of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 as angiogenesis in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) compared to the fibroadenoma (Fib)group (Ahmadi et al. 2021 ). The expression levels of VEGF-A are associated with progesterone receptor-positive status in breast cancer patients. Studies have shown that the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) gene, which is expressed in the circulation at low levels, is correlated with breast cancer metastasis in breast cancer patients (Abdi et al. 2020 ). Researchers have conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of CoQ10 intake, as a supplement, on angiogenesis in breast cancer patients (Alimohammadi et al. 2021 ). The results revealed that CoQ10 supplementation could reduce some important markers of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which are angiogenesis mediators, as well as inflammation, including VEGF and IL8, in patients with breast cancer. In another independent study, researchers investigated the associations between plasma levels of CoQ10 and the expression levels of VEGF and VEGFR2, angiogenic factors, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), metabolism-related factors, in Iranian breast cancer patients (Abdi et al. 2020 ). The results revealed a significant correlation between the expression patterns of the VEGF-A and VEGFR2 genes. VEGFR2 expression was positively correlated with tumour size. There was an inverse correlation between the expression levels of CoQ10 and the expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR2 (Jamshidnezhad et al. 2021 ). Insulin-like growth factors: IGFs, ESR1 and COMT Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are essential for the development of the mammary gland, but are also implicated in cancer progression (Christopoulos et al. 2015 ). Several studies have investigated the role of the IGF genes in Iranian breast cancer patients. In a study, IGF1 and the lncRNAs LINC00963 and LINC01089 were significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues. These lncRNAs interact with IGF1 mRNA and serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The oncogenic miR-1244-5p suppresses IGF1 r expression, influencing the FOXO signaling pathway and correlating with key clinical features such as lymph node metastasis and menopausal status (Rezaei et al. 2023 ). In a case\u2013control study, IGF-2 levels were significantly higher in breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls, while IGF-1 levels showed no difference. These findings suggest IGF-2 as a potential prognostic biomarker (Alizadeh Sadighi et al. 2024 ). Another study found that breast cancer patients positive for ER\u03b1 but negative for SCUBE2 and BCL2 had significantly poorer survival, while coexpression of HER2 and IGFR1 indicated worse outcomes. The results emphasize assessing multiple biomarkers beyond PGR to better evaluate ER\u03b1 functionality and prognosis (Esmaeili et al. 2021 ). Additionally, a case\u2013control study on 509 cases focused on the association between 2q35-rs13387042 and the risk of breast cancer (Nesaei et al. 2022 ). 2q35-rs13387042 SNP is regulated the expression of IIGFB5 gene (Ghoussaini et al. 2014 ). A significant correlation reported for the variant and the increased risk of breast cancer. The high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) gene activates during early embryonic development and inactivates during adulthood. The abnormal expression of the gene was associated with various tumours, such as breast cancer. In this case, a bioinformatic and experimental analysis examined the relationship between rs10573247 polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer among the Iranian population. Their results revealed that TT deletion of the polymorphism was associated with the development of breast cancer (Najibi et al. 2024 ). Apoptosis regulatory genes: BCL2 and SCUBE2 Genes regulating apoptosis, such as B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and SCUBE2, also influence breast cancer prognosis. BCL2 is an apoptotic regulator gene that is differentially expressed in different malignancies, including breast cancer (Lippman et al. 2008 ). Studies by Iranian researchers using a case\u2012control study of a total of 240 cases revealed a significant association between the frequency of large alleles of CA repeats (Hesari et al. 2019a ; Golmohammadzadeh et al. 2019 ) in the BCL2 gene promoter and a greater risk of breast cancer development in Isfahan Province, Iran (Ghorbani et al. 2021 ). Therefore, BCL2 gene functions as an estrogen-regulated gene that is crucial in hormone therapy for breast cancer. Compared with the BCL2 + and/or SCUBE2 + groups, the SCUBE2- and BCL2- groups presented poorer survival, as reported in Iranian patients. It has been reported that patients in the SCUBE2- and BCL2- groups had poorer survival than those in the BCL2 + and/or SCUBE2 + groups. Iranian researchers reported that the SCUBE2 \u2212 and BCL2 \u2212 groups had poorer survival than the BCL2 + and/or SCUBE2 + groups did, indicating that signal peptide, CUB, and EGF-like domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2), a glycoprotein on the cell surface, play crucial roles in hormone therapy for breast cancer, and researchers have reported its involvement in suppressing cancer proliferation (Esmaeili et al. 2021 ). Scientists have proposed that SCUBE2, a glycoprotein on the cell surface, is an important estrogen-related gene in hormone therapy. In a previous study, compared with other patients, patients in the ER\u03b1-positive, SCUBE2-, and BCL2-negative groups exhibited markedly poorer survival (Lippman et al. 2008 ). Table 1 lists the kinases and growth factors associated with genetic markers identified in the above studies.

( 2020 ) 2020 PPAR-\u213d, VEGF-A, HIF-1\u03b1 231C/77P The healthy pattern was inversely associated with BBD, and this could be correlated with downregulation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3), Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), & hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1\u03b1) genes Hashemi-Bahremani et al.

Alterations in the expression of immune-regulatory factors can disrupts normal cellular physiology and promotes malignancy. PD-1 (PDCD1), PD-L1 (CD274), LSP1 and LAG-3 Programmed cell death (PD-1), a protein product of the PDCD1 gene, and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), encoded by the CD274 gene, are critical immune checkpoint molecules. They regulate T-cell effector functions in both cancer and autoimmunity (Mokhtari et al. 2012 ). Several studies in Iran have focused on the relationship between PD-L1 and breast cancer progression. A systematic review conducted by Iranian researchers revealed that the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 could be used as an effective breast cancer therapeutic drug (Bastaki et al. 2020 ). Several studies have investigated the involvement of PD-L1 dysregulation in human breast cancer in the Iranian population. Additionally, a systematic review revealed a positive correlation between high levels of tumour -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-L1 expression in TNBC patients (Shadbad et al. 2021 ). In vitro findings demonstrated that the level of PD-L1 expression was downregulated in response to the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Furthermore, in silico data indicated that PD-L1 expression positively correlated with EGFR signaling, epithelial to mesenchymal transition-related transcription factors (EMT-TFs), and stemness markers in metastatic breast cancer (Azadi et al. 2019 ). A study revealed that low expression of miR-424-5p could increase the expression of PD-L1. Furthermore, PD-L1 can inhibit cell proliferation via the modulation of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Dastmalchi et al. 2020 ). Researchers reported that miR-424-5p, miR-138-5p, miR-570-3p, miR-200c-3p, miR-383-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-3609, miR-195-5p, and miR-497-5p inhibited tumour al PD-L1 expression in TNBC cells (Shadbad et al. 2021 ). In silico and in vitro studies have shown that miR-335 and miR-145 can directly regulate the expression of PD-L1 at the mRNA level and prevent the development of breast cancer (Hajibabaei et al. 2023 ). The hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of these genes can upregulate the expression of PD-L1 in the MCF-7, BT-549, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines (Hajibabaei et al. 2023 ). Moreover, researchers have shown that downregulation of miRNA-138-5p could increase the expression level of PD-L1 in breast cancer. This occurs by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway, which has an anti-proliferative effect, through the inhibition of PD-L1 expression. In addition, this study revealed that this miRNA could inhibit cell motility via downregulation of MMP-2, MMP-9, and Vimentin and upregulation of E-cadherin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Rasoolnezhad et al. 2021 ). Other findings include: (i) Reduced miR-383-5p expression leading to increased PD-L1 levels and enhanced cell migration in breast cancer, while overexpression of miR-383-5p in T cells elevated proinflammatory cytokines, supporting its tumour-suppressive role (Azarbarzin et al. 2021 ); (ii) Upregulation of miR-561-3p reducing PD-L1, ZEB1, HIF1A, and MYC expression, thereby suppressing proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and causing cell cycle arrest (Yousefi et al. 2024 ); Higher breast cancer grades correlating with increased CD86, PD-1, and PD-L1 expression in B cells, while CD39 expression correlated with tumour size, suggesting B cells may suppress tumour progression (Shariati et al. 2020 ).; Silencing PD-L1 with siRNA restored T-cell cytotoxicity by increasing proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) in breast cancer cell lines (Shadbad et al. 2021 ). A large study on 361 breast cancer patients from Tehran reported that co-expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and LAG-3 was significantly higher in luminal B and TNBC subtypes, with LAG-3 expression strongly correlating with PD-1 and PD-L1 (Pournabee et al. 2023 ). In addition, impaired NK cell function\u2014characterized by reduced activating receptors (CXCR3, NKG2D) and increased inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TGF-\u03b2RII), particularly in CD56^bright NK cells\u2014was observed in breast cancer patients. These findings suggest that NK cell dysfunction contributes to tumour progression and highlight NK cell restoration as a potential immunotherapy strategy (Arianfar et al. 2022 ). Cytokines also play important roles. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which functions as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and anti-inflammatory myokine, has genetic variants associated with cancer progression. A systematic review in Iranian patients revealed that the AA + GA genotype of rs1800797 increased breast cancer risk, while the GC and CC + GC genotypes of rs2069840 were protective (Azizi et al. 2024 ). PD-1 expression itself has been reported as significantly higher in breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Hoseini and Sarani 2024 ). In one cohort, PD-L1 was detected in 11.5% of breast cancer samples, predominantly in TNBC, where it was associated with higher tumour grade but not stage. Interestingly, PD-L1 was more frequently expressed in CD8\u207a TILs than tumour cells, and circulating PD-L1 levels did not correlate with tissue expression, suggesting that PD-L1 blockade could benefit TNBC patients without interference from serum PD-L1 (Karami et al. 2020 ). A cross-sectional study of 107 TNBC patients confirmed that PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with higher tumour grade and increased Ki67 expression (Izadi et al. 2024 ). Another study similarly found PD-L1 expression to be enriched in high-grade TNBC tumours, reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic target (Yazdanpanah et al. 2021 ). The LSP1 gene on chromosome 11p15.5 encodes an actin-binding protein that regulates immune cell motility, and its polymorphisms, such as rs3817198, have been linked to altered breast cancer susceptibility (Sieuwerts et al. 2010 ). In a northeastern Iranian population, the LSP1 rs3817198 polymorphism demonstrated significant predictive and prognostic value for sporadic breast cancer, with specific genotypes associated with altered disease susceptibility and progression (Afzaljavan et al. 2020 ). In another case\u2013control study, the LSP1 rs3817198 TT genotype and the CASC rs4784227 CC and TT genotypes were consistently associated with significantly increased breast cancer risk, highlighting their potential roles as genetic susceptibility markers (Nourolahzadeh 2020 ). IFN\u213d, EGR1, TGF-\u03b2, CXCR3 and NKG2D The IFN\u213d gene encodes a soluble cytokine, a type II interferon that is secreted by both the innate and adaptive immune systems (Cardenas et al. 2019 ). Alterations at the gene level could change gene function with the development of cancer (Cardenas et al. 2019 ). The tumour -infiltrating natural killer (TINK) and the expression of the activating natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor by these cells function as important arms of immunity against malignancies, including breast cancer (Rezaeifard et al. 2021 ). Several studies by Iranian scientists revealed a positive correlation between the percentage of regulatory NK cells and tumour size in patients with breast cancer in the Iranian population. In contrast, the specific TGF-\u03b2 ligand, synthesized by all white blood cell lineages, interacts with both the type 1 and type 2 receptor subunits of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2). Aberrant signalling of TGF-\u03b2 receptors has been associated with a wide range of human pathologies, including autoimmune diseases and cancers such as breast cancer (Bhola and Arteaga 2011 ). Moreover, an investigation in a subpopulation from Iran revealed that CXCR3 and NKG2D expression was lower in breast cancer samples than in normal samples (Arianfar et al. 2022 ). Moreover, increased MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MIC-A) levels are correlated with increased expression levels of TGF-\u03b2RII and PD-1 in all NK cells, whereas increased IFN-\u03b3 expression is associated with decreased TGF-\u03b2RII expression on CD56 bright NK cells (Arianfar et al. 2022 ).

Disruption of apoptosis promotes uncontrolled cell proliferation and accumulation of genetic alterations, ultimately leading to tumorigenesis. CASP8 The cysteine-aspartic acid protease 8 gene (CASP8) is an initiator caspase in the apoptosis pathway, and mutations in this gene are associated with breast cancer progression (MacPherson et al. 2004 ). In Iranian populations, several studies have examined the role of CASP8 polymorphisms: (i) A case\u2013control study identified polymorphisms such as rs1045485 and rs10931936 as significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk (Afzaljavan et al. 2023 ); (ii) A genome-wide study found associations between rs3754934 and rs12990906 and breast cancer susceptibility. Moreover, haplotypes combining rs1045485, rs10931936, and rs3817578 were linked to greater breast cancer risk. Interestingly, the rs3754934-C allele and CC genotype were associated with reduced risk of death in hormone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer patients (Pasdar et al. 2019 ); (iii) The CC genotype of rs1045485 was found to reduce breast cancer risk (Vahednia et al. 2019 ). These findings suggest that CASP8 gene polymorphisms may serve as genetic markers for breast cancer susceptibility and prognosis. TOX3 The TOX3 gene, located on chromosome 16q21, encodes a high-mobility group box protein that is more highly expressed in breast tumours compared to normal tissue (Jones et al. 2013 ). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TOX3 are strongly associated with altered gene regulation and increased breast cancer risk across different populations (Han et al. 2016 ). The studies show: (i) The rs3803662 polymorphism, located near TOX3 within the uncharacterized gene LOC643714, reduces TOX3 mRNA expression in breast tissue (Tajbakhsh et al. 2019a ); (ii) A case\u2013control study in northeastern Iran (943 participants) reported a significant association between rs3803662 and breast cancer risk (Tajbakhsh et al. 2019a ); (iii) Additional studies demonstrated that the T alleles of rs4784227 and rs8051542 were significantly linked to increased breast cancer risk. The TT genotype at both loci showed strong associations across additive, recessive, and dominant genetic models (Jamali et al. 2020 ). These results suggest that TOX3 polymorphisms could serve as valuable biomarkers for breast cancer risk in the Iranian population. MDM2 The mouse double minute 2 homologue (MDM2) gene encodes an oncoprotein that blocks p53 tumour suppressor-mediated transcriptional transactivation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms can alter the gene expression levels (Atwal et al. 2007 ). Altered expression levels of the MDM family are strongly associated with an increased risk of cancer incidence, including breast cancer (Haupt et al. 2017 ). In this respect, Iranian researchers have focused on the association between breast cancer susceptibility and the frequency of genetic variants in this gene. They showed that the GG genotype of SNP309 (rs2279744) of the MDM2 gene is correlated with breast cancer (Jalilvand et al. 2020 ).

Dysregulation of DNA repair or biosynthesis pathways can lead to mutations, genomic instability, and cancer progression. Here the studies performed on some of the most relevant breast cancer susceptibility genes are reviewed. BRCA1 and BRCA2 Breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) are tumour suppressor genes that play important roles in DNA repair, replication fork protection, cell cycle regulation, and gene transcription regulation (Shah et al. 2022 ). Many studies have indicated the important role of these two genes in the risk of breast cancer progression (Neamatzadeh et al. 2015 ). Studies on Iranian breast cancer patients have highlighted the importance of BRCA1/2 mutations in familial breast cancer cases (Vasigh et al. 2022 ). The most common indications for genetic testing included: (i) A positive family history in first-degree relatives, and/or; (ii) Two relatives diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 (Ebrahimi et al. 2019 ). A review of mutation profiles in Iran identified several common pathogenic variants as following: BRCA1: c.81-1G > C, c.66_67delAG, c.4609C > T, c.1568delT, c.1961delA and BRCA2: c.3751_3752insA, c.8585dupT (Majidzadeh-A et al. 2022 ). These findings underscore the role of BRCA1/2 mutations as genetic risk factors for breast cancer in the Iranian population. MTHFR Methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) functions in DNA biosynthesis and genome integrity, and variations in this gene can increase the susceptibility to cancer (Ergul et al. 2003 ). Several Iranian studies have focused on the role of variations in this gene and the incidence of breast cancer among the Iranian population. Based on two independent case\u2012control studies in different subpopulations in Iran, rs1801133 SNP in the MTHFR gene was introduced as a prognostic marker of breast cancer (Hesari et al. 2019b ). PTEN Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene encodes a tumour suppressor protein that regulates cell cycle progression and prevents uncontrolled cell division. Mutations or deletions in PTEN are a critical step in carcinogenesis (Li et al. 1997 ). A systematic review concluded that PTEN mutations significantly increase the risk of breast cancer development (Yari et al. 2024 ). Table 4 summarizes DNA repair and cell cycle\u2013related markers from these studies (Table 5 ). Table 4 Summary of studies on DNA biosynthesis and repair markers in breast cancer Author (Ref.

A key strength of our study is the integration of locally relevant data on molecular pathways regulating cellular growth, proliferation, apoptosis, immune function, and DNA repair. Unlike previous reviews, our work highlights epidemiological and genetic features that appear distinct within the Iranian population, offering valuable insights for precision medicine. Kinases and growth factors emerged as key regulators of breast cancer progression, consistent with global findings. For example, HER2 amplification in Iranian patients correlated with higher tumour grade, invasive ductal carcinoma, absence of ER/PR receptors, and Ki-67 overexpression\u2014mirroring results from Chinese and Tanzanian cohorts (Ding et al. 2017 ; Shokouh et al. 2015 ; Mansouri et al. 2019 ). These associations underscore the prognostic importance of HER2, TP53, and Ki-67 in predicting metastasis, especially among younger women. Similarly, variants in the FTO gene were found to activate PI3K/AKT signaling in ER-positive patients and increase breast cancer risk, particularly in overweight individuals. Associations between FTO rs9939609 and breast cancer were reported in Iran, with modifying effects from diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, and omega-6 intake (Hassanzadeh Makoui et al. 2024 ; Montazeri et al. 2022 ; Doaei et al. 2022 ). Interestingly, these polymorphisms showed population-specific effects, such as stronger associations in non-obese Iranians (Mozafarizadeh et al. 2019 ) and interaction with MC4R variants in Brazilians (Castro et al. 2021 ). Together, these results suggest that metabolic-genetic interactions play an important role in breast cancer susceptibility. For the first time in Iran, co-expression effects of BCL2 and SCUBE2 were linked to patient survival, introducing new potential prognostic markers (Esmaeili et al. 2021 ). Immune regulatory pathways represent another major category of biomarkers studied in Iranian breast cancer patients. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis, in particular, has been consistently investigated and shown to be dysregulated, especially in TNBC. Similar to studies from China, the U.S., and other populations (Zhao et al. 2019 , 2016 ; Zhou et al. 2021 ; Gramantieri et al. 2021 ; Chen et al. 2022 ; Song et al. 2020 ; Mittendorf et al. 2014 ; Wu et al. 2022 ; Pacheco-Torres et al. 2020 ), Iranian research demonstrates that miRNA-mediated regulation (e.g., miR-424-5p, miR-138-5p, miR-335) modulates PD-L1 expression and may influence tumor immune evasion. These findings align with international evidence supporting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as effective treatments for PD-1/PD-L1\u2013positive cancers, including TNBC (Mokhtari et al. 2012 , 2017 ; Lotfinejad et al. 2021 ). VEGF has also been a consistent focus in Iranian studies, where its overexpression correlates with higher tumor grade, metastasis, and poor survival. This mirrors international findings (Liu et al. 2011 ; Ahmadi et al. 2021 ; Liang and Li 2014 ), confirming VEGF\u2019s role as a driver of angiogenesis and aggressive disease behavior. However, clinical translation of VEGF-targeted therapies in Iran remains limited, and larger multicenter studies are needed to establish predictive or therapeutic utility. In terms of genome integrity, most Iranian studies have focused on sporadic breast cancer, with BRCA1/2 research reserved for familial cases. Consistent with global studies (Shah et al. 2022 ; Neamatzadeh et al. 2015 ; Vasigh et al. 2022 ), Iranian patients with multiple hereditary risk criteria demonstrated significantly higher BRCA1/2 mutation rates, highlighting the value of comprehensive genetic screening. Importantly, early-onset breast cancer alone (< 40 years) was insufficient to predict mutations, reinforcing the need for combined hereditary criteria to guide testing strategies. Collectively, genomic and proteomic research has identified numerous markers with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential. In Iranian cohorts, the most frequently studied genes include CD274, FTO, VEGF, HER2, PDCD1, CASP8, TOX3, BRCA1, and BRCA2, with sample sizes ranging from 373 to over 2,788 patients. While many findings align with international data, gaps remain in the study of other regulators such as the MCM2\u20137 complex, PHH3, and epigenetic modifiers, which remain underexplored in Iran. In summary, cell cycle and molecular markers\u2014including growth factors, immune checkpoint regulators, apoptosis-related genes, and DNA repair factors\u2014represent powerful tools for improving breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Expanding multicenter studies, integrating immune and angiogenic markers, and applying advanced in vitro and in vivo models will be essential for validating these findings and enabling their clinical application. Ultimately, these efforts may pave the way for precision oncology tailored to the Iranian population.

    "full_text_abstract": "The mortality rate of breast cancer remains relatively high in the Iranian population, with approximately 4810 deaths reported in 2020 (GLOBOCAN). This elevated fatality rate has been predominantly attributed to delays in diagnosis. In recent years, substantial research efforts have been directed toward elucidating cellular markers associated with breast cancer within this population. To this end, a systematic literature search was undertaken across both international and national databases, including PubMed, Scopus, IranMedex, and Magiran, covering the period from 2019 to 2024. The review synthesized data from studies encompassing a total of 15,318 Iranian breast cancer patients. The aggregated evidence provides comprehensive insights into cellular growth and cell cycle regulation markers implicated in breast cancer, thereby offering potential to inform the development of population-specific molecular diagnostic and prognostic strategies."
