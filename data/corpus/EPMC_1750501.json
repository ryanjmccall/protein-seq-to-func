  "abstract_text": "Spindle-shaped cells from Kaposi's sarcoma lesions (AIDS-KS cells) were cultured for long periods in the presence of conditioned medium from activated CD4-positive T cells (HTLV-II infected transformed nonvirus producer) and characterized under in vitro conditions. To investigate a possible vascular origin, AIDS-KS cells were analyzed for the presence of smooth muscle alpha-actin, a differentiation marker for vascular smooth muscle cells. Immunofluorescence studies using a monoclonal antibody for smooth muscle alpha-actin demonstrated positive staining of the AIDS-KS cells (KS-3 and KS-4) but not by endothelial cells or fibroblasts. Northern blot analysis using an oligonucleotide probe unique for human smooth muscle alpha-actin indicated the expression of this gene by AIDS-KS cells. Similar analysis of biopsies from the KS lesion showed that in addition to the staining of smooth muscle cells associated with the blood vessels, the tumor-related spindle cells also stained positively. These cells were also analyzed for the expression of different growth factor genes. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain gene was expressed at a moderate level. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2) genes were not overexpressed in relation to control cells. These data suggest that the analyzed AIDS-KS cells may be smooth muscle-like cells and therefore of vascular origin. Based on these results as well as previous reports, we speculate that cells of the immune system may regulate growth of cells in the vascular wall by a novel pathway.",
