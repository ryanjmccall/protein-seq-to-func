  "title": "An unusual FGFR1 mutation (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 mutation) in a girl with non-syndromic trigonocephaly.",

  "abstract_text": "Non-syndromic trigonocephaly is a heterogeneous entity; in most cases the origin is unknown. Rare cases with autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance exist. Here the mutational screening of ten patients in the FGFR1, 2, and 3 genes and the TWIST gene causative of autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndromes was reported. In one girl an unusual FGFR1 mutation was found.",
