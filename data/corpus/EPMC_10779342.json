    "abstract_text": "Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) plays important roles in cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation. It may also participate in M phase events, although heretofore only circumstantial evidence has suggested such involvement. Here we show that Rb interacts, through an IxCxE motif and specifically during G(2)/M phase, with hsHec1p, a protein essential for proper chromosome segregation. The interaction between Rb and hsHec1p was reconstituted in a yeast strain in which human hsHEC1 rescues the null mutation of scHEC1. Expression of Rb reduced chromosome segregation errors fivefold in yeast cells sustained by a temperature-sensitive (ts) hshec1-113 allele and enhanced the ability of wild-type hsHec1p to suppress lethality caused by a ts smc1 mutation. The interaction between Hec1p and Smc1p was important for the specific DNA-binding activity of Smc1p. Expression of Rb restored part of the inactivated function of hshec1-113p and thereby increased the DNA-binding activity of Smc1p. Rb thus increased the fidelity of chromosome segregation mediated by hsHec1p in a heterologous yeast system.",
