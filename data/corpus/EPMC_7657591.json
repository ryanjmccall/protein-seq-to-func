  "abstract_text": "The murine retroviral oncogene v-cbl induces pre-B cell lymphomas and myelogenous leukemias. The protein product of the mammalian c-cbl proto-oncogene is a widely expressed cytoplasmic 120-kDa protein (p120cbl) whose normal cellular function has not been determined. Here we show that upon stimulation of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, p12ocbl becomes strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with activated EGF receptor in vivo. A GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1-486 of p120cbl, including a region highly conserved in nematodes, binds directly to the autophosphorylated carboxyl-terminal tail of the EGF receptor. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), or nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation also results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120cbl. Recent genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that Sli-1, a p120cbl homologue, plays a negative regulatory role in control of the Ras signaling pathway initiated by the C. elegans EGF receptor homologue. Our results indicate that p120cbl is involved in an early step in the EGF signaling pathway that is conserved from nematodes to mammals.",
