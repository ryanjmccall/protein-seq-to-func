  "abstract_text": "The LKB1 and AMPK proteins participate in an energy sensing cascade that responds to depletion of ATP, serving as a master regulator of metabolism that inhibits anabolic processes and stimulates catabolic processes. However in recent years, LKB1 and AMPK have been implicated in a variety of other cellular processes, both cytoplasmic and nuclear, such as control of cell polarity and regulation of gene transcription. In this review, we summarize the most recent discoveries regarding participation of LKB1 and AMPK in signaling pathways that respond to cellular stress and damage, and the relevance of this signaling for disease and therapy.",
