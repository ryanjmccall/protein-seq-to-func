  "abstract_text": "Cells in dissociated culture preparations of the superior cervical ganglion of the adult rat were examined for the presence of insulin receptors. This was assessed immunocytochemically by the demonstration of binding by a mouse monoclonal anti-insulin receptor antibody. A large subpopulation (> or = 90%) of neuronal cell bodies and associated neurites exhibited positive immunostaining. The apparent absence of staining over nuclear regions suggested that the majority of neuronal receptors had an intracytoplasmic localisation. In contrast, a subpopulation of fibroblasts showed punctate immunostaining, which appeared to be confined to the cell surface. Glial (satellite) cells did not appear to be immunostained. The possible effects of insulin on neurons in the peripheral nervous system are discussed.",
