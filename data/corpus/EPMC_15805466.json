    "abstract_text": "Cells respond to a variety of extracellular and intracellular forms of stress by down-regulating rRNA synthesis. We have investigated the mechanism underlying stress-dependent inhibition of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription and show that the Pol I-specific transcription factor TIF-IA is inactivated upon stress. Inactivation is due to phosphorylation of TIF-IA by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) at a single threonine residue (Thr 200). Phosphorylation at Thr 200 impairs the interaction of TIF-IA with Pol I and the TBP-containing factor TIF-IB/SL1, thereby abrogating initiation complex formation. Moreover, TIF-IA is translocated from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm. Substitution of Thr 200 by valine as well as knock-out of Jnk2 prevent inactivation and translocation of TIF-IA, leading to stress-resistance of Pol I transcription. Our data identify TIF-IA as a downstream target of the JNK pathway and suggest a critical role of JNK2 to protect rRNA synthesis against the harmful consequences of cellular stress.",
