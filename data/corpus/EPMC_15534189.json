    "abstract_text": "<h4>Background</h4>Mutations in polymerase gamma cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia and a variety of associated symptoms and signs, including neuropathy, ataxia, hypogonadism, hearing loss, muscle weakness, and psychiatric problems. Extrapyramidal signs have been rarely described.<h4>Objective</h4>To describe a family with a novel polymerase gamma mutation and autosomal dominant transmission of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, neuropathy, hypogonadism, and parkinsonism.<h4>Design</h4>Case report.<h4>Patients</h4>The proband, a 49-year-old woman with incipient parkinsonism, and her 59-year-old brother with overt parkinsonian features.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Mutation in the proband by sequencing the polymerase gamma gene and in affected relatives by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We found multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in the proband's muscle and a novel missense mutation in the polymerase gamma gene (A2492G) in the proband and in her affected siblings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Parkinsonism was a prominent clinical feature in this family with autosomal dominant ophthalmoplegia, multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions, and a novel mutation in the polymerase gamma gene.",
