    "abstract_text": "The SNF2-related CBP activator protein, SrCap (pronounced \"sir cap\"), shares homology with the SNF2/SWI2 protein family. SrCap was cloned through its ability to bind CBP. SrCap can function as a CBP coactivator and can activate transcription in a reporter assay when expressed as a Gal-SrCap fusion protein. A monoclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of SrCap coimmunoprecipitates CBP/p300, supporting the model that SrCap is a CBP binding protein and that these proteins can be found together in a cellular protein complex. In addition, several cellular proteins are coimmunoprecipitated by the SrCap-specific antibody. Since adenovirus E1A proteins interact with CBP/p300 proteins, we examined what proteins could be copurified in a SrCap-specific coimmunoprecipitation assay from lysates of adenovirus-infected cells. While E1A proteins were not detected in this complex, to our surprise, we observed the presence of an infected-cell-specific band of 72 kDa, which we suspected might be the adenovirus DNA binding protein, DBP. The adenovirus DBP is a multifunctional protein involved in several aspects of the adenovirus life cycle, including an ability to modulate transcription. The identity of DBP was confirmed by DBP-specific Western blot analysis and by reimmunoprecipitating DBP from denatured SrCap-specific protein complexes. Using in vitro-translated DBP and SrCap proteins, we demonstrated that these proteins interact. To determine whether this interaction could affect SrCap-mediated transcription, we tested whether increasing amounts of DBP could modulate the Gal-SrCap transcription activity. We observed that DBP inhibited Gal-SrCap transcription activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest a novel mechanism of adenovirus host cell control by which DBP binds to and inactivates SrCap, a member of the SNF2 chromatin-remodeling protein family.",
