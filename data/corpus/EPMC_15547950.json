  "abstract_text": "Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins play important roles in the regulation of cell death by apoptosis. The yeast Two-Hybrid system was utilized to identify a protein that interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, designated BMRP. This protein corresponds to a previously known mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRPL41). Binding experiments confirmed the interaction of BMRP to Bcl-2 in mammalian cells. Subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation studies showed that both Bcl-2 and BMRP are localized to the same fractions (fractions that are rich in mitochondria). Northern blot analysis revealed a major bmrp mRNA band of approximately 0.8 kb in several human tissues. Additionally, a larger 2.2 kb mRNA species was also observed in some tissues. Western blot analysis showed that endogenous BMRP runs as a band of 16-17 kDa in SDS-PAGE. Overexpression of BMRP induced cell death in primary embryonic fibroblasts and NIH/3T3 cells. Transfection of BMRP showed similar effects to those observed by overexpression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax or Bad. BMRP-stimulated cell death was counteracted by co-expression of Bcl-2. The baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35 also protected cells from BMRP-induced cell death. These findings suggest that BMRP is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein involved in the regulation of cell death by apoptosis, probably affecting pathways mediated by Bcl-2 and caspases.",
