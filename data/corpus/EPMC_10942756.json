    "abstract_text": "The snake venom toxin convulxin activates platelets through the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI)/Fc receptor gamma-chain (FcR gamma-chain) complex leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the tyrosine Syk and phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2). In the present study, we demonstrate that convulxin is a considerably more powerful agonist than collagen or the GPVI-selective collagen-related peptide (CRP). Confirmation that the response to convulxin is mediated solely via Syk was provided by studies on Syk-deficient platelets. The increase in phosphorylation of the FcR gamma-chain is associated with marked increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream proteins including Syk, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), SLP-76, and PLCgamma2. The transmembrane adapter LAT coprecipitates with SLP-76 and PLCgamma2, as well as with a number of other adapter proteins, some of which have not been previously described in platelets, including Cbl, Grb2, Gads, and SKAP-HOM. Gads is constitutively associated with SLP-76 and is probably the protein bridging its association with LAT. There was no detectable association between Grb2 and SLP-76 in control or stimulated cells, suggesting that the interaction of LAT with Grb2 is present in a separate complex to that of LAT-Gads-SLP-76. These results show that the trimeric convulxin stimulates a much greater phosphorylation of the FcR gamma-chain and subsequent downstream responses relative to CRP and collagen, presumably because of its ability to cause a greater degree of cross-linking of GPVI. The adapter LAT appears to play a critical role in recruiting a number of other adapter proteins to the surface membrane in response to activation of GPVI, presumably at sites of glycolipid-enriched microdomains, enabling an organized signaling cascade that leads to platelet activation.",
