    "abstract_text": "The clinical and genetic features of three non-Portuguese and non-Japanese patients with aprataxin gene mutations are reported. Patient 1 came from Italy and presented with typical ataxia with ocular motor apraxia (OMA). She was homozygous for the W279X nonsense mutation, which is associated with the Portuguese founding haplotype. Patients 2 and 3 were French siblings and did not present with either OMA or hypoalbuminemia. They were compound heterozygous for the nonsense W279X mutation and a missense K197Q mutation.",
