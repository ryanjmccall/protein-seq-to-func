The testis, with the highest number of transcriptionally active genes among human tissues, offers a unique window into how aging affects complex gene regulation. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled multi-species studies of aging-related transcriptome changes in testes. However, a comprehensive aging-related cross-species platform for analyzing testicular single-cell transcriptomes remains absent. To address this gap, we developed Aging-TCA (Aging-related Testicular Cell Atlas, available at http://tca.xielab.tech/)— a comprehensive online platform containing aging-related testicular single cell and spatial transcriptome profiles from human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and zebrafish across 89 samples and over 460, 000 testicular cells, nuclei or spots. Aging-TCA provides versatile tools for temporal and spatial analyzing testicular aging, including aging-related testicular gene expression visualization, cell-cell communication comparisons, cell-trajectory analysis, gene regulatory network analysis, testicular cell type auto-identification, time-series analysis, and spatial transcriptome comparisons. In summary, we provide a novel platform Aging-TCA for advancing cross-species research into testicular aging, facilitating future investigations in this field.

Notably, most of these hallmarks drive aging processes through their effects on gene expression regulation at a molecular level. Previous studies have demonstrated that the testis exhibits the highest transcriptome complexity among mammalian organs [ 2 ]. This underscores the potential value of studying age-related changes in the testicular transcriptome to better understand gene expression dysregulation during aging. Besides, the age at which men first become fathers is increasing. Evidenced by the data on millions of births in the USA, the average paternal age increased from approximately 27 years in 1972 to around 31 years in 2015 [ 3 ]. The aging of testis could disrupt the spermatogenesis in human, and the aged sperms show increasing telomere length, more DNA fragmentations, and imbalanced redox status. Furthermore, the increased paternal age could lead to higher risk of miscarriage and several childhood diseases (reviewed by Dong et al. [ 4 ]). Those studies highlight the importance of study testicular aging at gene expression level. With the advent of single cell RNA sequencing technologies, our lab and others had examined gene expression changes during testicular aging in different species at single-cell resolutions [ 5 – 10 ]. For instance, Cui et al. [ 6 ] generated more than 200,000 single-cell transcriptome profiles for human testis across Male reproductive ages spanning 21–69 years old. Meanwhile, Ma et al. [ 9 ] compared gene expression patterns between young (5–6 years old) and old (18–21 years old) cynomolgus monkeys, yielding over 70,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes of monkey testicular cells. Notably, these age stages correspond to equivalent human ages of approximately juvenile and 70 years old, respectively. Our lab has also conducted single-cell transcriptomic profiling of more than 40,000 testicular cells from both young (3 months old) and old-age (23 months old) mice [ 7 ]. This study highlighted age-related gene expression changes in testicular telocytes, where the two age stages correspond to equivalent human ages of approximately 20 and 60–70 years old. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing has been applied to non-mammalian species zebrafish, enabling the profiling of single-cell transcriptome changes in the testis across adult ages spanning 5–27 months [ 5 ]. These ages correspond to human equivalents ranging from young adulthood to old age. Recently, a spatial transcriptomic atlas of mouse study has included aging-related spatial transcriptomics for mice testis, covering young (2 months old) and old (25 months old) ages [ 11 ]. This dataset enables the spatial examination of aging-related testicular gene expression changes, where the two age stages correspond to equivalent human ages of approximately 18 and over 70 years old. Despite the accumulation of large-scale single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets for testicular aging studies across multiple species, integrative analyses of these datasets remain underexplored. In this study, we present an aging-related testicular cell atlas (Aging-TCA), an integrative resource designed to elucidate age-related gene expression changes in testicular biology across species. This publicly available online platform integrates 392,056 single-cell or single-nucleus transcriptomic profiles from four species (human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and zebrafish) to facilitate cross-species comparisons of aging-related gene expression changes in the testes. Additionally, Aging-TCA incorporates 12 spatial transcriptomic profiles derived from young and aged mouse testes, providing spatial context for the testicular aging studies. Furthermore, the atlas offers a suite of analytical tools tailored for testicular aging research, including cell-cell communication comparison, longitudinal time-series analysis, age-related differentially expressed gene analysis, pseudotime-based spermatogenesis analysis, and testicular cell type auto-identification. Ultimately, the Aging-TCA platform presented in this study has the potential to serve as a highly valuable resource and online tool, facilitating future investigations into testicular aging at the single-cell transcriptome level. Results Overview of Aging-TCA Aging-TCA database is an online web server that offers a suite of tools to explore testicular aging at single-cell transcriptome level. The database includes 392,056 single-cell or single-nucleus transcriptomic profiles from four species (human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and zebrafish), alongside 76,802 spatial transcriptomic spots for mouse testicular aging study (Fig. 1 A, Supplementary Table S1 ). The human dataset consists of 113,215 single-cell transcriptomic profiles from 35 samples, spanning ages from 21 to 69 years with five age categories: 20 s ( n = 3), 30 s ( n = 4), 40 s ( n = 10), 50 s ( n = 8), and 60 s ( n = 10). In contrast, the monkey dataset comprises 122,664 single-nucleus transcriptomic profiles from 7 samples, divided into two age groups: young (5–6 years old, n = 3) and old (18–21 years old, n = 4). The mouse dataset includes 69,894 single-cell transcriptomic profiles from 17 samples, as well as over 70,000 spatial transcriptomic spots from 12 testicular slice samples. These 17 mouse samples with single-cell transcriptomic data consist of 9 old-age group samples (21–24 months old) and 8 young-age group samples (2–3 months old). Furthermore, the 12 testicular spatial transcriptomic slice samples were obtained from seven mice: three young mice (2 months old) contributed five slices, while four old mice (25 months old) contributed seven slices. For the zebrafish datasets, we analyzed a total of 86,283 single-cell transcriptomic profiles from 18 samples of 10 individual zebrafish, spanning five distinct age groups: 5 months ( n = 3 × 2, with three replicates for each of two individuals), 12 months ( n = 1 × 2, with one replicate per individual for two fish), 20 months ( n = 2 × 1, with two replicates from a single individual), 22 months ( n = 2 × 1, with two replicates from another individual), and 27 months ( n = 6, comprising multiple replicates from four individuals). These age groups were further categorized as young (5 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old (20–27 months). Testicular cell types are annotated based on the known marker genes from previous studies [ 5 , 9 , 12 – 36 ](Supplementary Figure S1 , Supplementary Table S2 ). Fig. 1 Overview of Aging-TCA datasets and online tools. A Data resource of Aging-TCA. B Online tools of Aging-TCA Aging-TCA offers a comprehensive suite of analytical panels for investigating testicular aging, including Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) analysis panel, Age-DEG analysis panel, time-series comparison panel, spatial transcriptome analysis panel, cell-cell communication analysis panel, Pseudotime-based analysis panel, and the testicular cell-type auto identification panel (Fig. 1 B). Collectively, these panels facilitate versatile analyzing of testicular aging at single-cell or single-nucleus transcriptome level for the four species. Moreover, our comparative analysis of gene expression across human tissues revealed that the testis exhibits a uniquely high number of expressed genes (Supplementary Figure S2 ), highlighting the importance of elucidating aging-related transcriptome changes in this tissue. Aging-related pairwise and time-series analysis of testicular gene expression As illustrated in Fig. 2 , pairwise analysis panels within the Aging-TCA database empower researchers to perform customized comparisons between selected samples or age groups. The database offers two complementary visualization tools for gene expression: violin plots (Fig. 2 A) and UMAP-based scatterplots (Fig. 2 B). Aging-TCA supports both sample-level and age-group integrated comparisons, enabling researchers to seamlessly compare samples across different ages or the integrate data from various age-groups. Fig. 2 Aging-related pairwise comparison. Pairwise gene expression comparisons for the different age-group datasets based on violin plots ( A ) or UMAP-based scatter plots ( B ) Furthermore, the database provides dedicated panels for germ cell pseudotime-based analysis (Fig. 3 A-B) and time-series analysis (Fig. 3 C). The pseudotime-based approach allows researchers to explore germ cell gene expression changes during spermatogenesis between young and old age groups (Fig. 3 A). Notably, Aging-TCA facilitates cross-species comparisons of aging-related gene expression patterns during spermatogenesis, allowing researchers to elucidate conserved and divergent aging-associated transcriptional dynamics across different species throughout the spermatogenic process (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 Germ cell pseudotime-based analysis and time-series analysis. A Germ cell pseudotime-based gene expression comparison in the old and young mouse testes. B Germ cell pseudotime-based and age-related gene expression comparison across species. C Time-series analysis of testicular gene expression and the temporally co-expressed genes In addition, for the human studies, Aging-TCA offers time-series comparisons of gene expression for each testicular cell type (Fig. 3 C). Researchers can select a specific testicular cell type and human gene name, and the database will display the gene’s expression changes during the aging process. Moreover, Aging-TCA identifies and illustrates the top co-expression genes, providing valuable information on potential regulatory relationships. Aging-related cell-cell communication analysis in the testis Single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cell-cell communication (CCC) at the cell type level, and Aging-TCA offers a comprehensive platform for analyzing aging-related CCC in the testes of three mammalian species. Firstly, Aging-TCA provides a global overview of the aging-related changes in cell-cell interactions (CCIs) between old and young testes, highlighting both the number and strength of these interactions (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, Aging-TCA offers a suite of tools for in-depth analysis of CCC, including emitter and receiver cell type-centered analyses (Fig. 4 B) and Ligand-Receptor Interaction (LRI) Analysis (Fig. 4 C). Fig. 4 Aging-related cell-cell communication analysis. A Global analysis of cell-cell communication. B Aging-related cell-cell communication analysis for given emitter or receiver cell types. C Aging-related ligand-receptor cell-cell interaction (CCI) analysis The CCC analysis panel (Fig. 4 B) allows researchers to select a specific cell type and investigate aging-related changes in its emitting and receiving CCC signals. Additionally, researchers can focus on individual emitter-receiver pairs and examine the aging-related LRI changes for specific ligands or receptors (Fig. 4 C). These tools collectively enable researchers to dissect testicular aging-related CCC from multiple angles, providing a nuanced understanding of the complex interactions involved. Aging-related gene regulatory network analysis To investigate aging-related changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs), we employed the GRN analysis tool within Aging-TCA to dissect GRN alternations across different species (Fig. 5 A-C, Supplementary Figure S3 ). Specifically, we constructed GRNs for germ cells of the testis in each species and identified modules that facilitate age-related comparisons. Notably, our analysis revealed both shared and age-stage-specific genes within these modules. For instance, module 1 (M1) in human germ cells comprised 16 genes common to young and old individuals, as well as 9 genes unique to each age stage (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, we observed shared and age-stage-specific genes in each module across other species, providing insights into conserved and divergent GRN changes during aging (Fig. 5 B-C, Supplementary Figure S3 ). Fig. 5 Aging-related gene regulatory network analysis. A - C Gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis in each species. A : Human, B : Cynomolgus monkey, C : Mouse. Young and old shared genes are highlighted in red Automated annotation of testicular cell types Cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell sequencing datasets. To facilitate this process for testicular cells, Aging-TCA introduces a novel algorithm and online tool that enables scoring the cell type annotations for specific cell clusters (Fig. 6 A-C). The cell annotation panel within Aging-TCA allows researchers to upload cluster-level marker gene file for cell type scoring, and the UMAP coordinates file for visualization purposes (Fig. 6 A). These input files required by Aging-TCA for cell annotation could be generated by Seurat [ 37 ]. Through interactive tables provided by Aging-TCA, researchers can inspect the known marker genes used in the scoring process and their corresponding cell type annotation scores (Fig. 6 B). Additionally, the database visualizes the top three cell types with the highest cell type annotation scores on a UMAP plot (Fig. 6 C). Fig. 6 Aging-TCA tools for auto-identification of testicular cell types. A Data uploading panel for cell type annotation. B Table of the cell type annotation. C Visualization of the testicular cell type annotation Spatial transcriptome comparison in the young and old testes Although single-cell transcriptomic profiles offer insights into cell-type specific and temporal gene expression patterns, they lack information on cellular spatial organization. To bridge this gap, we integrated a spatial transcriptome profiling dataset from a recent study [ 11 ] into Aging-TCA, enabling comparisons of aging-related gene expression across spatial dimensions. As shown in Fig. 7 A, researchers can visualize cell type distributions within 2D testicular slices across different age groups. Additionally, Aging-TCA facilitates the comparison of aging-related gene expression changes between age-group samples (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, we also identified spatially variable genes (SVGs) from the spatial transcriptome datasets and provide online access to these genes for further exploration (Fig. 7 C).

C Spatially variable genes identified and the associated Moran’s I scores. Methods Data collection All the sequencing datasets used in Aging-TCA can be downloaded from the public databases. For the datasets without gene expression matrix files, the raw sequencing datasets were downloaded, otherwise the processed matrix files provided by the original studies were downloaded. In detail, the raw matrix files for the human testicular aging study were downloaded from NCBI GEO database (GSE254315). The raw sequencing data for the monkey testicular aging study [ 9 ] was downloaded from NGDC GSA database ( https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA007812 ). For the mouse single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, the raw sequencing data for the dataset from our group [ 7 ] can be downloaded from NGDC GSA database ( https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA014599 ), the raw matrix files for the dataset from Zhang et al.’s study [ 8 ] were downloaded from NGDC OMIX database ( https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/omix/release/OMIX1000 ), the raw matrix files for the dataset from Liu et al..’s study [ 10 ] were downloaded from NCBI GEO (GSE270931). For the mouse spatial transcriptomic profiling datasets [ 11 ], the processed H5AD format files were downloaded from CNGB’s STOmicsDB ( https://db.cngb.org/stomics/datasets/STDS0000247/data ). The zebrafish testicular scRNA-seq data utilized in this study was originally generated by Sposato et al. [ 5 ]. and the matrix data files were retrieved from NCBI GEO (GSE275361). More information about the data used in our study can be found in the Supplementary Table S1 . The bulk-RNA sequencing data for different human tissues were downloaded from GTEx ( https://www.gtexportal.org ) database, and the Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values provided by the database were used as the normalized gene expression for the comparison. Single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing data processing To analyze the monkey single cell sequencing datasets based on the raw sequencing reads, we first downloaded the reference genome and gene annotation files from the Ensembl database (Macaca fascicularis 6.0). The CellRanger (version 7.0.0) software from 10X Genomics was used for the raw sequencing data processing, which generated the CELLxGENE expression matrix for further analysis. The processing of the raw sequencing datasets from our group followed the methods described in our previous research [ 7 ]. The CELLxGENE expression matrix datasets from different species were further analyzed by R Seurat package [ 37 ] (Version 5). To determine optimal cutoffs for data filtering, we generated quality control plots for each sample, examining the distribution of expressed genes, total UMI counts, and percentage of mitochondrial transcripts. Cells were then filtered based on the following criteria: minimal number of expressed genes (> 800 for human, monkey, and mouse; >250 for zebrafish), minimum total sequenced UMIs (> 1000), and maximum percentage of mitochondrial transcripts (< 20% for human and mouse XieG2024 datasets, 15% for zebrafish datasets, and < 5% for mouse WangJ2022 and monkey datasets). Genes were filtered based on their expression in at least three cells. Additionally, species-specific thresholds for Maximum features and UMI counts were set according to the distribution of these metrics. Specifically, the Maximal numbers of features for human, monkey, mouse, and zebrafish are 7500, 3000, 7500, 7000, respectively. Similarly, the Maximal numbers of total UMI counts for human, monkey, mouse, and zebrafish are 30,000, 6000, 60,000, and 7000, respectively. The single-cell gene expression datasets were further normalized by Seurat NormalizeData and ScaleData functions, and ones with multiple samples were integrated through Harmony method [ 38 ]. Dimensional reduction method PCA was applied for cell clustering by Seurat FindClusters, and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) dimensional reduction method was used for data visualization. FindAllMarkers function with default Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to identify age-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) in each testicular cell types, and the P -values were adjusted by Bonferroni correction. The DEGs should have detected expression in at least 25% of the cells in one of the age groups (Old or Young), and the associated adjusted P -values should be less than 0.05. Cell trajectory and time-series analysis For the cell trajectory analysis, we specifically focused on the germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocyte, and spermatids), which share a developmental progression. The germ cell trajectory analysis and pseudotime inference was performed using Monocle 3 [ 39 ], where the spermatogonia stem cell farthest away from the spermatids was selected as the trajectory root node. The progression of spermatogenesis is delineated by germ cells arranged in ascending order of pseudotime values, reflecting their developmental trajectory from earlier to later stages. Graph test method from Monocle 3 was further used to identify genes that are differentially expressed along spermatogenesis pseudotime. To investigate inter-species differences in gene expression dynamics across spermatogenesis pseudotime, homologous gene orthologs were retrieved from the Ensembl BioMart database (Ensembl Gene Release 110), and only the one-to-one homologous genes among species were retained for comparative analysis. To facilitate the direct comparison of the spermatogenesis pseudotime across species, the pseudotime values from different species were further normalized to the range of 0 to 1. Functional enrichment analysis The functional enrichment analysis of age-related differentially expressed genes was carried out based on two methods: one is based on ClusterProfiler [ 40 ] and another is based on gprofiler2 [ 41 ]. For the ClusterProfiler-based analysis, the gene annotation database for each species were first installed, and then the enrichGO function from ClusterProfiler was utilized to do the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, which include Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC, and Biological Process (BP). The P -values for each GO term were further adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg method (BH) for multiple hypothesis testing correction, and the GO terms with adjusted P -values that are less than 0.05 were defined as the significantly enriched GO terms. For other pathway enrichment analysis, gprofiler2 R package was used, which is an interface to the g: Profiler online toolset. The P -values from gprofiler2 were also adjusted by BH method, and the same P -value cutoff was applied to define the significant pathway terms. Cell-Cell communication analysis R package CellChat [ 42 ] (version 1.6.1) was first utilized for the cell-cell communication analysis in each age group of each species. The mergeCellChat function was used to merge the CellChat objects from different age groups in each species to facilitate the age-related comparison of interaction strength and frequency changes. The circle plot function netVisual_diffInteraction from CellChat was used to visualize the age-related cell-cell communcation network differences, and the rankNet function from CellChat was used for the signaling networks comparison. Furthermore, the scDiffcom [ 43 ] was used for the differential cell-cell communcation among different age groups for each testicular cell type in each species. The differential analysis was performed by the run_interaction_analysis function from scDiffcom, which used the permutation testes (1000 permuation) to assess the significance of the age-related changes for potential cell-cell interactions (CCI). Testicular cell type annotation and the Auto-identification tool construction The cell type annotation for each species was based on the known marker genes for each testicular cell type (Supplementary Table S2 ). Besides, an auto-identification tool was also provided by the Aging-TCA database, which can automatically predict cell-type scores for each given cell clusters. Two input files are needed for this tool: one is the file with cluster-level marker genes identified by Seurat FindAllMarkers for cell type scoring, and another is the file with UMAP coordinates values for cell type annotation visualization. The scoring method is based on the enrichment of the known marker genes in the cluster-level marker genes.

Spatial transcriptomic profiling analysis The gene expression and spatial coordinates information was extracted from the h5ad files from the original study. To better visualize the gene expression, the spots from the spatial transcriptome were aggregated to bins (size of bin: 50). The gene expression in each bin was further normalized by the total number of sequencing counts by Scanpy’s [ 44 ] normalize_total function with default settings. The spatially variable genes were analyzed by Squidpy [ 45 ] based on Moran’s I score. Gene regulatory network analysis Gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis was performed using the R package hdWGCNA [ 46 ], which builds GRNs based on gene co-expression information. The GRN analysis was initialized using the SetupForWGCNA function from hdWGCNA, with parameters set to `fraction = 0.05, gene_select=”fraction”`. To facilitate downstream analysis, all germ cells (from spermatogonia to spermatids) were aggregated into a single cell type “germ cell” in the cell type column. Next, the MetacellsGroups function from hdWGCNA was applied to construct meta-cells from the given data, using parameter settings `group.by = c(“cell type”, “group”), k = 25, max_shared = 10, reduction=”harmony”`. Here, the group column represents different age stages. To determine the optimal soft-power threshold for GRN analysis, the TestSoftPowers function from hdWGCNA was used to compute topology models across a range of thresholds. Finally, the co-expression GRN was constructed using the ConstructNetwork function with default settings, which groups genes into modules. Aging-TCA database and website construction Aging-TCA online database was built based on the R shiny server ( https://shiny.posit.co ), and the R package shinydashboard ( https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard ) was used for data visualization in the user interface. To reduce the memory usage, the single cell gene expression datasets and spatial transcriptome datasets are loaded into PostgreSQL database, which use an object-relational database management system to store and retrieve data. The database was constructed using a method that leveraged several R packages for data visualization, including the DT package (version 0.32) for interactive data tables, along with ggplot2 (version 3.5.0), cowplot (version 1.1.3), patchwork (version 1.2.0), and ggrepel (version 0.9.5) for advanced plotting and layout customization. Discussion The human testis exhibits the highest number of expressed genes among all tissues (Supplementary Figure S2 ). Investigating transcriptional changes in the testis during aging can provide valuable insights into the molecular regulation mechanisms underlying testicular aging and, more broadly, the general aging process. However, a database that enables online analysis of testicular aging at the single-cell transcriptome level with both temporal and spatial contexts has been lacking. To address this gap, we have developed the Aging-TCA database (Aging-related Testicular Cell Atlas, available at http://tca.xielab.tech/ ). Our database allows researchers to compare aging-related gene expression changes across four species (human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and zebrafish) and different age stages. Notably, Aging-TCA supports various analyses, including pairwise comparison of age-related gene expression changes, cell-cell communication analysis, cell trajectory analysis, time-series analysis, gene regulatory network analysis, and spatial transcriptome analysis. Although our database has several strengths, it also has some limitations. Currently, only datasets from one species are available for the panels related to time-series analysis (human) and spatial transcriptome analysis (mouse). We plan to integrate those datasets from other species as they become available. Furthermore, the cross-species comparison in this study is limited by differences in the scope of detected RNAs due to variations in sequencing technologies used across species. Notably, the cynomolgus monkey dataset was generated using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), whereas other species were profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This discrepancy is significant, as scRNA-seq captures whole cells, while snRNA-seq focuses on isolated nuclei, potentially missing cytoplasmic RNAs and favoring the detection of actively transcribed nuclear RNAs. Additionally, the datasets from different species cover distinct age ranges in young and old stages, introducing possible biases in inter-species aging-related transcriptome comparisons. For instance, the young cynomolgus monkey group is approximately 5–6 years old, corresponding to a human juvenile stage, where the young human group is around 21 years old. To mitigate these limitations, future studies using single-cell sequencing technologies for testicular aging research across species would benefit from more continuous age designs. To facilitate improvements in age-matched cross-species analysis, our Aging-TCA database provides a community platform where researchers can upload relevant scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq datasets. As the cost of single-cell RNA sequencing technologies continues to decrease, we anticipate that this resource will become increasingly valuable for the research community. From a technical perspective, we used the R shiny framework for website development, which significantly reduced development time. However, generally, the R shiny server will load the whole R datasets into memory, which is not suitable for the development based on large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we integrated the PostgreSQL database management system with the R shiny server, which enables adaptive data retrieval and reduces memory loading for the R shiny server. Specifically, the transcriptomic datasets are stored in a local PostgreSQL database, and only relevant data are loaded into memory for visualization. In conclusion, Aging-TCA provides a versatile online tool for testicular aging studies based on temporal and spatial single-cell transcriptomics datasets. Our database has the potential to greatly facilitate future research in this area. Supplementary Information Supplementary Material 1. Supplementary Material 2. Supplementary Material 3.

  "abstract_text": "The testis, with the highest number of transcriptionally active genes among human tissues, offers a unique window into how aging affects complex gene regulation. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled multi-species studies of aging-related transcriptome changes in testes. However, a comprehensive aging-related cross-species platform for analyzing testicular single-cell transcriptomes remains absent. To address this gap, we developed Aging-TCA (Aging-related Testicular Cell Atlas, available at http://tca.xielab.tech/)— a comprehensive online platform containing aging-related testicular single cell and spatial transcriptome profiles from human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and zebrafish across 89 samples and over 460, 000 testicular cells, nuclei or spots. Aging-TCA provides versatile tools for temporal and spatial analyzing testicular aging, including aging-related testicular gene expression visualization, cell-cell communication comparisons, cell-trajectory analysis, gene regulatory network analysis, testicular cell type auto-identification, time-series analysis, and spatial transcriptome comparisons. In summary, we provide a novel platform Aging-TCA for advancing cross-species research into testicular aging, facilitating future investigations in this field.
