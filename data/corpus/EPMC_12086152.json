    "abstract_text": "Recently, a few genetic abnormalities were identified in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS or Ondine's curse). CCHS is often associated with other neurocristopathies, especially with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Mutations of the genes involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET (REarranged during Transfection) (RET)-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and/or endothelin 3 (EDN3)-endothelin receptor-B (EDNRB) signaling pathway have been found in some of HSCR patients. In this study, we analyzed candidates for HSCR, namely the RET, GDNF, EDN3 and EDNRB genes in three isolated CCHS patients to confirm the hypothesis that some CCHS patients have a common genetic abnormality with patients having HSCR or other neurocristopathies. We found a novel R114H mutation of the RET gene in one patient. The R114H mutation is unlikely to be a polymorphism and appears to be associated with CCHS. In addition, we also examined the HOX11L2 (RNX) gene, for which knock-out mice showed CCHS-like syndrome in these isolated CCHS patients and did not detected any mutation. Further cases should be analyzed for more candidates to clarify the pathophysiology of CCHS.",
