Keywords Colon cancer Rectal cancer Genomic profiling Transcriptomic analysis Copy number alterations Driver genes Consensus molecular subtypes Molecular stratification issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC), which comprises colon and rectal cancer, represents a significant health problem, ranking as the third most common type of cancer in terms of frequency and second in terms of mortality [ 1 ]. In fact, despite considerable progress in therapeutic strategies, almost a third of CRC patients recur [ 2 – 4 ]. The majority of CRC is sporadic, though cancer predisposition is observed in kindreds with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) [ 5 , 6 ]. Current histological classification of CRC comprises three primary subtypes, denoted intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma [ 7 ]. Until recently, CRC has been considered as a single entity in most studies, without distinction between cancers originating from the colon epithelium (Colon Cancers, CC) and those originating from the rectum, generally within 15 cm of the anal sphincter (Rectal Cancers, RC). CC are classified proximal (right-sided) when they originate from segments proximal to the splenic flexure (cecum, ascending colon and transverse colon) or distal (left-sided) when they arise distally of the splenic flexure (descending colon and sigmoid colon). However, CRC is a heterogeneous disease with different epidemiological, biological, clinical and pathological features [ 8 ], which suggests the necessity of re-evaluating the term CRC [ 9 ]. First, rectum and colon mucosa present pronounced differences in anatomy, embryological origin and function [ 10 – 13 ]. The rectum originates from the posterior hindgut while the colon originates from the midgut [ 14 – 16 ]. Rectal mucosa shows a higher overall risk of malignant transformation compared with colon mucosa and is observed more frequently in men [ 17 – 19 ]. Second, lesions in the colon are frequently flat while lesions in the rectum are more frequently polypoid with villous components [ 20 ]. In addition, tumors with mucinous and signet-ring cell histology are more frequent in the proximal colon (approximately 45%) than in the distal colon or in the rectum (approximately 20%) [ 20 , 21 ]. Third, patients with CC exhibit different symptoms, surgery-associated morbidity [ 22 ] and sensitivity toward anti-EGFR therapy in comparison with those with RC [ 23 – 25 ] . RC presents higher rate of local relapse than CC and, accordingly, shorter long-term survival [ 26 ]. Liver metastases are more frequent in the case of CC whereas extra-abdominal metastases (i.e. lung) occur more often in RC [ 21 ]. Further indications that CC and RC may be considered as different diseases derive from studies that have demonstrated that proximal CC, distal CC and RC present significant differences at the molecular level, with distal CC being more similar to RC [ 23 , 27 – 32 ]. At the molecular level, CRC can be classified according to the type of genetic instability that characterizes the tumors: (i) tumors with chromosomal instability (CIN, > 60% of cases) with numerical and/or structural chromosome changes that include amplifications and loss of heterozygosity; (ii) tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI, 12–20% of cases) that are characterized by defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR), which result in variations in the length of microsatellite sequences; and (iii) tumors with CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP, 20–30% of cases) that are characterized by the methylation of usually unmethylated CpG clusters within promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes [ 33 ]. Within this framework, it has been shown that proximal CC, distal CC and RC exhibit marked differences in mutations, expression profiles, CIN, MS stability, CIMP status, immunological reactivity and composition of tumor microenvironment [ 23 , 24 , 34 – 39 ]. In particular, proximal CC are preferentially hypermutated, MSI, mutant for BRAF , infiltrated by lymphocytes and with a serrated signature. Conversely, distal CC are preferentially CIN [ 11 , 40 ], with active EGFR signalling due to amplification of HER1 and/or HER2 and wild-type BRAF [ 23 ] whereas RC are more similar to distal CC. In agreement with these observations, previous studies from our lab have shown that tumors arising in various colon segments presented differences in the type and frequency of mutated and/or genetically altered genes [ 41 , 42 ]. In the present manuscript, we report on the distinctive molecular features that characterize CC and RC by performing a comprehensive in-silico comparison of their chromosome, mutation and transcription profiles from data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) database. The results of this analysis uncovered distinct molecular signatures for CC and RC that may be of help for better classification and more accurate therapeutic strategies. Results Comparative analysis of the genetic profiles of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) datasets Copy number alterations in COAD and READ The genetic alterations of patients present in the COAD and READ datasets were compared using data available from the TCGA database for analysis of Copy Number Variations (CNVs). Using the TCGAbiolinks package, we investigated the data relative to CNV in primary tumor samples present in the COAD and READ datasets. GISTIC peaks were used to compare altered genomic regions subjected to amplification or deletion in CC (n = 43) and RC (n = 26) (Additional file 1 , sheet 1). See Venn Diagram in Fig. 1 A. Fig. 1 Characterization of copy number alterations in patients present in COAD and READ datasets. A Venn diagram represents the number of CNAs that were either common to CC and RC or private. B GISTIC chromosome plot representing regions of amplification (red) and deletion (blue) in CC patients; C GISTIC chromosome plot representing regions of amplification (red) and deletion (blue) in RC patients. Chromosomes are indicated in the middle. The 5 most statistically significant altered cytobands are annotated in green; focal chromosomal regions altered exclusively in CC or in RC are underlined. CNAs Copy Number Alterations, CC Colon Cancer, RC Rectal Cancer The most significant recurrent CNVs were identified using GAIA algorithm [ 43 ] and are represented in chromosomal plots in Fig. 1 B for CC and 1C for RC. Panels in Figure S1A and S1B show the most frequent alterations observed in CC and RC, respectively. CNVs were classified as focal (< 3 Mb) or large-scale (> 3 Mb) [ 44 ]. We identified 30 chromosome regions with focal aberrations in CC ( n = 12 amplifications; n = 18 deletions) and 19 chromosome regions with focal aberrations in RC ( n = 7 amplifications; n = 12 deletions) (Additional file 1 , sheet 2). Focal aberrations (range 0.01–2.94 Mb) included an average of 6 genes in CC and an average of 3 genes in RC (range 0.02–2.64 Mb). We also identified 13 large-scale CNV in CC ( n = 4 amplifications; n = 9 deletions) and 7 large-scale CNV in RC ( n = 2 amplifications; n = 5 deletions) (Additional file 1 , sheet 2). Large-scale aberrations contained an average of 106 altered genes in CC (range 3.21 Mb–94.37 Mb) and 101 genes in RC (range 4.63 Mb–28.03 Mb). Among the large peaks identified in the COAD dataset, 6 included at least 50 genes (i.e. deletion at 1p13.1 containing 483 genes; deletion at 10q25.2 containing 339 genes; deletion at 15q11.2 containing 135 genes; deletion at 15q15.2 containing 106 genes; deletion at 5q21.1 containing 51 genes and amplification at 6p21.1 containing 89 genes). Of the 7 alterations identified in the READ dataset, 4 included at least 50 genes (i.e. deletion at 1p36.11 containing 399 genes; deletion at 22q13.31 containing 80 genes; deletion at 14q11.2 containing 65 genes; amplification at 20q11.21 containing 75 genes) (Additional file 1 , sheet 2). In some cases, RC and CC presented alterations of the same cytogenetic band but differed in frequency, as in the case of CN loss at 8p23.2 (Additional file 1 , sheet 2). In other cases, CC and RC presented alterations of the same cytogenetic band that differed in length (i.e. cytoband 8p23.2 was classified as large-scale CNV in CC and focal CNV in RC while cytoband 1p36.11 was considered focal in CC and large-scale in RC), thus resulting in a different number of altered genes. Moreover, deletion of 8p23.2 included 15 genes in CC and 2 genes in RC while deletion at 1p36.11 included 399 genes in RC and only 28 genes in CC. Significant CC alterations were identified at 8q24.21 and 13q12.13 (focal gains), 20q11.21 (large-scale amplification), 4q22.1, 6q26, 16p13.3 and 20p12.1 (focal deletions) (Fig. 1 B and Additional file 1 , sheet 2). Significant RC alterations mapped at 13q12.13 and 13q12.2 (focal gains), 20q11.21 and 20q11.23 (large-scale amplification), 4q22.1, 16p13.3 and 20p12.1 (focal deletions) (Fig. 1 C and Additional file 1 , sheet 2). The comparison between CC and RC allowed the identification of a set of chromosome alterations that were specific of each tumor type, that were either CC- or RC-private [13/30, in CC (43%) and 2/19 in RC (10.5%)]. Focal CC-private aberrations were 13, including 7 CN gains (8p11.23, 12p13.33, 13q22.1, 19q13.11, 20p11.21, 20p11.23, 20q13.12) and 6 CN losses (8p22, 10q23.31, 15q21.1, 16q23.1, 18q12.2, 22q13.32) (Additional file 1 , sheet 2). In particular, the focal amplification at 12p13.33 that included the TEAD4 oncogene was observed in 25% of patients while the focal amplification at 13q22.1 that included the KLF5 oncogene was observed in 61% of patients. Conversely, focal deletion at 10q23.31, observed in 24% of patients, included the PTEN tumor suppressor gene while deletion at 15q21.1 including the B2M tumor suppressor gene was observed in 37% of patients. CC-private large-scale chromosome alterations were 10 (77%) (gains at 6p21.1, 17q24.1, 20q12; losses at 1p13.1, 4q35.1, 5q21.1, 10q25.2, 15q11.2, 15q15.2, 18q22.1). The large-scale amplification at 6p21.1 that included the FOXP4 oncogene was observed in 21% of patients while the large-scale amplification at 20q12 that included the PLCG1 oncogene was observed in 72% of patients (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, the two focal RC-private CN gains were observed in 26% of patients (at 12p12.1 containing the KRAS oncogene) and in 83% of patients (at 13q12.2 containing the caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2, CDX2 ). RC-private large-scale chromosome alterations were 4 (57%): one CN gain at 20q11.23 that included CREPT and SRC (98% in RC) and three CN losses (14q11.2, 21q11.2 and 22q13.31 observed in 41% of patients, which included NUP50) (Fig. 1 C). As to alterations shared between CC and RC, they represented 57% of focal alterations identified in CC ( n = 17) and 89% of alterations identified in RC ( n = 17). Of the identified focal alterations, 5 were gains (at 8p11.21, 8q24.21, 11p15.5, 13q12.13, 17q12) while 11 were losses (at 1p36.11 (focal in CC and large in RC), 3p14.2, 3q26.31, 4q22.1, 5q12.1, 6p25.3, 6q26, 10q21.1, 16p13.3, 15q22.33, 18q21.2, 20p12.1) (Additional file 1 , sheet 2). Shared focal alterations included amplification at 13q12.13 (containing USP12) observed in 67% of CC and 83% of RC, amplification at 17q12 (including ERBB2 ) observed in 28% of CC and 30% of RC, deletion at 15q22.33 (containing SMAD3) observed in 39% of CC and 51% of RC, deletion at 16p13.3 (containing RBFOX1) observed in 14% of CC and 9% of RC and deletion at 6q26 (containing PARK2) observed in 15% of CC and 20% of RC. On the other hand, shared large-scale alterations were three (3/13, 23%): one CN gain (20q11.21, present in 80% CC and 97% RC) and 2 CN losses (5q22.2, present in about 30% of CC and RC; 8p23.2 (large in CC and focal in RC) present in 47% of CC and 67% of RC). Notably, the observed deletion at 5q22 included APC and the amplification at 20q11.21 included several genes implicated in cancer such as ASXL1, PLCG1, TOP1, PTPRT, ID1, BCL2L1, TPX2, HCK, PLAG2, POFUT1, DNMT3B, E2F1 (Additional file 1 , sheet 2). Overall, 50% of the genomic alterations observed in the COAD dataset and 25% of the genomic alterations observed in the READ dataset were private, suggesting that a substantial difference at the genomic level exists between CC and RC. Gene mutations in COAD and READ Subsequently, we investigated the mutational profiles of the tumors present in COAD and READ databases, respectively. Different somatic mutations that included missense, nonsense and splice site mutations as well as frameshift and in-frame insertions or deletions were selected, by setting a threshold of frequency ≥ 2% (Additional file 1 , sheet 3). Overall, we found significant differences in the number of variants between CC and RC, with 122,304 variants reported in the COAD datasets and 31,378 variants reported in the READ datasets. In terms of mutation types, the most common mutations were missense, with cytosine changes C > T and C > A showing the highest frequency (Fig. S1C and S1D). The distribution of the most frequent somatic variants for each dataset is shown in the oncoplots in Fig. 2 A and B, respectively. Fig. 2 Characterization of mutational profiles in patients present in COAD and READ datasets. A Oncoplot depicting the 20 most frequently mutated genes with colour annotations to distinguish different mutation types within the COAD dataset. B Oncoplot depicting the 20 most frequently mutated genes with colour annotations to distinguish different mutation types within the READ dataset. The frequency is calculated by dividing the number of patients with mutations in one specific gene by the total number of patients. The bars on the right display the number of variants identified in each gene. C Venn diagram represents shared and exclusive mutated genes (with a frequency threshold ≥ 2%) within COAD and READ datasets The first notable difference between CC and RC was in the number of mutations per megabase (muts/Mb). The value of muts/Mb was significantly higher in CC than in RC, in agreement with the observation that Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) were fourfold more frequent in CC (Fig. S1E). In fact, CC showed an average log 10 mutation rate/sample of 0.51/Mb (range from − 0.70 to 2.28) while RC showed an average log 10 mutation rate/sample of 0.28/Mb (range from − 0.74 to 2.35), respectively (Wilcoxon test; p- value = 6.6e-08). Accordingly, the number of mutated genes was 6263 (122,304 variants) in CC and 5059 (31,378 variants) in RC. Figures 2 A and B shows the genes most frequently mutated in CC and RC, respectively. In addition, of the identified mutated genes, 2738 were CC-private (43%), 1534 were RC-private (30%) while 3525 were shared between CC and RC (Fig. 2 C). Notably, the mutation frequency of CC-private genes was less than 10%, whereas RC-private genes exhibited a frequency below 6%. Subsequently, we identified potential driver genes through the use of DriverDBv4 ( http://ngs.ym.edu.tw/driverdb ), a database that contains 14 computational methods to identify driver genes in CC and RC patients (406 and 150, respectively) and of PRODIGY (Personalized Ranking of Driver Genes analysis), an algorithm that compares patients by combining mutation and gene expression profiles of tumors [ 45 ]. This analysis led to the identification of 459 driver genes in CC and 418 driver genes in RC. See Additional file 1 , sheet 4. As expected, the most frequently mutated genes were common to both CC and RC, and included APC (355 total variants distributed 71% of COAD samples and 80% of READ samples), TP53 (169 total variants distributed in 55% of COAD samples and 73% of READ samples), TTN (896 total variants distributed in 52% of COAD samples and 43% of READ samples) and KRAS (26 total variants distributed in 43% of COAD samples and 40% of READ samples). Furthermore, significant differences between CC and RC were found in the type and frequency of mutated genes. First, numerous genes were mutated in a CC- or RC-private manner: 61 genes (13%) were mutated exclusively in CC (i.e. ACVR1B , 5.91%; LTBP4 , 5.91%; SETD1A , 5.17%) while 20 genes (4.8%) were mutated exclusively in RC (i.e. C4BPA , 4%; EHD1 3.3%; PPP3CC 2%). Notably, there was substantial overlap in the mutational presence of these genes across both tumor types, although with differing driver roles. Specifically, 47 out of the 61 CC driver genes (77%) were also found to be mutated in RC, but were not classified as drivers in RC. Conversely, 11 out of the 20 RC driver genes (55%) were also mutated in CC, but were not classified as drivers in CC. However, significant differences in mutation frequency between CC and RC was observed in many genes such as PIK3CA (31.5% in COAD vs 14.6% in READ), OBSCN (24% in COAD vs 12% in READ) and BRAF (14.3% in COAD vs 3.3% in READ), PTPRS (10.3% in COAD vs 2% in READ), CDH10 (10.1% in COAD vs 2% in READ), DNAH1 (12.8% in COAD vs 2.6% in READ) whose mutations were more common in CC or such as TP53 (55% in COAD vs 73% in READ) and NRAS (4.7% in COAD vs 10% in READ) whose mutations were more common in RC (Additional file 1 , sheet 3). Overall, these findings revealed the existence of distinct mutational genetic profiles that underline the development of CC and RC. Combination of gene mutations in CC and RC The mutational analysis allowed us to identify distinct combinations of mutated driver genes in CC and RC (Additional file 1 , sheet 5). The most numerous CC group (n = 140/406, 35%) was characterized by mutant APC , mutant KRAS and wild-type BRAF (Fig. 3 A). Notably, 31% (n = 43 of 140) of APC mutated CC patients presented also evident genomic alterations at 5q that included the APC gene. Mutations were also observed in TP53 (n = 77, 55%), TTN (n = 73, 52%), PIK3CA (n = 56, 40%), DCC (n = 10, 7%) and/or SMAD4 (n = 18, 13%). PIK3CA mutations were more common in tumors wild-type for TP53 (30/56, 54%). Mutations in SMAD4 and DCC were essentially mutually exclusive. All patients within this group, for which MSI data were available (n = 35), were MS stable and showed neither mutation in MMR genes nor methylation at the promoters of MLH1 , CDKN2A and MGMT . Fig. 3 Heatmap of mutation distribution for driver genes defining the different combinations in CC and RC. A CC with genotype mut APC _mut KRAS_wtBRAF ; B CC with genotype mut APC_wtKRAS _ wtBRAF ; C CC with genotype wtKRAS _ mutBRAF ; D CC with genotype wt APC_mutKRAS _ wtBRAF ; E CC with genotype mutNRAS; F CC with genotype wt APC_wtKRAS _ wtBRAF ; G RC with genotype mut APC ; H RC with genotype wt APC ; I RC with genotype mutAPC_mutKRAS _ mutTP53 ; J RC with genotype mutNRAS ; K RC with genotype wtNRAS . The code in the heatmaps is as follows: row: genes; column: patients; gray, nonmutated; mutated, blue in CC and red in RC. Frequencies of mutations are reported above the heatmap is shown how many genes are mutated in each sample. Percentage of patients with a mutation in the given gene is shown on the left. Barplots on the right show the total number of samples with a mutation in each gene. CC Colon Cancer, RC Rectal Cancer The second group of CC (n = 129/406, 32%) was mutant APC, wild-type KRAS and wild-type BRAF (Fig. 3 B) . Of note, 37% of APC mutated CC patients (n = 48 of 129) presented also evident genomic alterations at 5q that included the APC gene. These tumors presented mutations in TP53 (n = 95, 74%), TTN (n = 55, 43%), PIK3CA (n = 29, 22%), SMAD4 (n = 16, 12%) and DCC (n = 5, 4%). PIK3CA mutations were more common in tumors wild-type for TP53 (16/29, 55%). Mutations in SMAD4 and DCC were essentially mutually exclusive. Most patients within this group were MS stable (n = 27/30) and showed neither mutations in MMR genes nor methylation at the promoters of MLH1 ( n = 105/107 ) or CDKN2A ( n = 104/105 ). A third group of CC (n = 53/406, 13%) was characterized by mutant BRAF (Fig. 3 C). These tumors presented also mutations in TP53 (n = 20, 38%), APC (n = 18, 34%), PIK3CA (n = 19, 36%), SMAD4 (n = 7, 13%) and DCC (n = 15, 28%). It is of note that these tumors also present evidence of alterations at 5q in 15% of cases or alterations in other genes that increased Wnt signaling such as RNF43 . Notably, RNF43 mutations were frequently observed (22/53, 42%) especially in a setting of wild-type APC (18/22, 82%) compared with other tumor group with mutant APC ( 4/22, 18%). These tumors presented high frequency of methylation of the MLH1 promoter (16/31, 51%) with wild-type MMR genes and MS instability (8/10). Tumors with wild-type APC, mutant KRAS and wild-type BRAF (Fig. 3 D) comprised 7% of patients (29/406). These tumors presented mutations in TP53 (n = 13, 45%), PIK3CA (n = 13, 45%), CTNNB1 (n = 6, 21%), RNF43 (n = 5, 17%), SMAD4 (n = 4, 14%) and less commonly in DCC (n = 1, 3%). These tumors were MS stable (n = 7) and presented neither mutations in the MMR genes nor methylation of MLH1 promoter (25/26). It is of note that PIK3CA mutations were more common in tumors wild-type for TP53 (9/13, 69%) and that, in the absence of APC mutations, we found frequent alterations in genes that increased Wnt signaling such as CTNNB1 (21%) and RNF43 (17%). Another distinctive combination representing 5% of CC patients (19/406) was characterized by the presence of mutant NRAS (Fig. 3 E). Identified NRAS mutations were either high (Q61R, Q61L, Q61K, G12C, G12A, E76K) or low pathogenic (G12D, R164C, G13R, E132K, G12V) and co-occurred in some cases with KRAS or with BRAF mutations (n = 3 and 2, respectively), though these co-occurring NRAS mutations were low-activity (G12D and G12V). This group presented also frequent mutations in APC (n = 17/19, 89%), TP53 (n = 9/19, 47%), PI3KCA (n = 7/19, 37%) and SMAD4 (n = 5/19, 26%) but not in DCC . In this group mutations in TP53 and PI3KCA were mutually exclusive. All patients for which MSI data were available (n = 3) were MS stable and presented neither mutations in MMR genes nor methylation of the MLH1 promoter (n = 19). The last group, representing 12% of patients (50/406), comprised tumors with wild-type APC, KRAS and BRAF (Fig. 3 F). This group presented mutations in genes such as TP53 (n = 15, 30%), PI3KCA (n = 9, 18%), CTNNB1 (n = 7, 14%), RNF43 (n = 3, 6%), SMAD4 (n = 3, 6%) and DCC (n = 2, 4%). No overlap was observed between mutations in TP53 and PI3KCA with those in DCC and SMAD4 . Most patients within this group for which MSI data were available (n = 6) were MS stable and presented no mutations in the MMR genes and rare methylation of the MLH1 promoter (2/21). Regarding tumors originating in the rectum, we found frequent mutations in APC (120/150, 80%), TP53 (109/150, 73%) , KRAS (60/150, 40%), PI3KCA (22/150, 15%), SMAD4 (22/150, 15%), NRAS (15/150, 10%), DCC in (9/150, 6%) and less frequently in BRAF (5/150, 3%) (Additional file 1 , sheet 5). Several RC with mutant APC presented deletion at 5q (45/120, 37%), suggesting that biallelic loss of APC is frequent in RC. See Fig. 3 G. The remaining 20% of patients were wild-type for APC (Fig. 3 H). This group presented mutation in TP53 (13/30, 43%), KRAS (8/30, 27%), and TTN (7/30, 23%). In addition, approximately a quarter (n = 34/120, 28%) of APC -mutated RC were also mutant for KRAS and TP53 with fewer patients showing mutant PI3KCA (n = 5/34, 15%) or SMAD4 (n = 5/34, 15%) (Fig. 3I ). All RC patients for which MSI data were available (n = 7) were MS stable and, accordingly, presented neither mutations in MMR genes nor methylation of the MLH1 promoter (n = 24). A small subset of RC presented mutations in NRAS (15/150, 10%) (Fig. 3 J) . NRAS mutations included changes at residues Q61 (8 patients), G12 (5 patients) and G13 (2 patients). Most NRAS -mutated tumors presented mutations in APC (14/15, 93%) and TP53 (n = 12/15, 80%) and rare mutations in KRAS (n = 2), SMAD4 (n = 1), PIK3CA (n = 0) or BRAF (n = 0). NRAS and KRAS were mutually exclusive at the functional level since one patient with co-occurring mutations presented NRAS loss-of-function (Q61K)/ KRAS gain-of-function (A59T) variants and the other presented NRAS gain-of-function (Q61R)/ KRAS nonsense (E98*) variants. On the other hand, NRAS -negative RC (n = 135) presented mutations in APC (n = 106, 79%), TP53 (n = 97, 72%), KRAS (n = 58, 43%), PI3KCA (n = 22, 16%), SMAD4 (n = 21, 16%), DCC (n = 9, 7%) and BRAF (n = 5, 4%) (Fig. 3 K). In RC mutations in PIK3CA and SMAD4 were frequent in mut APC _mut BRAF (50%) and mut APC _mut KRAS (25%) but absent in mut APC _mut NRAS . Subsequently, we investigated the predictive value of specific mutation assets relative to overall survival (OS) in CC and in RC. To this aim, we generated Kaplan–Meier survival curves for different combination of mutations, by use of survival [ 46 ] and survminer [ 47 ] packages applying the log-rank test (Fig. S2). We found that CC patients with mutant APC , KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , PI3KCA or TP53 (or any combinations thereof) showed survival curves that were essentially similar to those of patients without mutations. The only significant genetic assets that showed a statistically significant predictive value for OS were mut APC _ BRAF and mut APC _ KRAS _ PIK3CA . Conversely, all other cohort of patients analyzed did not show any significant differences in OS. Notably, the presence of mutant TTN in combination with APC and/or KRAS markedly reduced OS in CC patients (Fig. S2), suggesting a special role for the TTN -encoded titin protein in colon cancer progression. On the other hand, no particular genetic asset that was significantly predictive of OS was observed in RC. Analysis of the transcriptomic profiles of CC and RC Comparative pan-cancer analysis of the transcriptional profiles of tumors and corresponding normal tissues First, we investigated how similar at the molecular level CC and RC were, in comparison to all available tumor types, by systematic pan-cancer gene expression analysis. To this aim, we downloaded gene expression data of 8734 primary tumor samples across 33 cancer types from TCGA and selected only 18 tumor types for which data from normal tissue counterparts (at least 10) were available. These included Colon Adenocarcinoma (tr-COAD), Rectal Adenocarcinoma (tr-READ), Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (tr-BLCA), Breast invasive carcinoma (tr-BRCA), Cholangiocarcinoma (tr-CHOL), Esophageal carcinoma (tr-ESCA), Glioblastoma multiforme (tr-GBM), Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma (tr-HNSC), Kidney Chromophobe (tr-KICH), Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (tr-KIRC), Kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (tr-KIRP), Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (tr-LIHC), Lung adenocarcinoma (tr-LUAD), Lung squamous cell carcinoma (tr-LUSC), Prostate adenocarcinoma (tr-PRAD), Stomach adenocarcinoma (tr-STAD), Thyroid carcinoma (tr-THCA), Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (tr-UCEC).

See Additional file 2 for CC and RC; see Additional file 3 for all other tumors. We first investigated the similarity of the transcriptional profiles of the normal tissues relative to the selected 18 tumor types (Fig. 4 A). See Table 2 for summary of the results. Fig. 4 Comparative transcriptomic analysis among 18 normal tissues and/or corresponding tumors. A Gene expression analysis of normal colon or rectum mucosa compared with additional 16 normal tissues, expressed as percentage of DEG similarity.

Percentage of DEGs shared between CC samples present in the COAD dataset (green square), RC samples present in the READ dataset (pink square) and tumor samples present in additional 16 datasets. Among the 5394 DEGs identified in COAD, 986 (18.3%) were also expressed differentially in LUAD, 948 (17.6%) in LUSC, 873 (16.2%) in BRCA, 787 (14.6%) in KICH, 703 (13%) in KIRC, 631 (11.7%) in UCEC, 614 (11.4%) in GBM, 533 (9.9%) in STAD, 502 (9.3%) in CHOL, 504 (9.3%) in KIRP, 476 (8.8%) in HNSC, 397 (7.4%) in LIHC, 293 (5.4%) in PRAD, 282 (5.2%) in ESCA, 271 (5%) in BLCA and 268 (5%) in THCA. Among the 3559 DEGs identified in READ, 346 (9.7%) were also expressed differentially in KICH, 319 (9%) in LUSC, 289 (8.1%) in GBM, 263 (7.4%) in UCEC, 249 (7%) in CHOL, 241 (6.8%) in LUAD, 227 (6.4%) in BRCA, 217 (6.1%) in KIRP, 215 (6%) in KIRC, 183 (5.1%) in BLCA, 157 (4.4%) in STAD, 149 (4.2%) in LIHC, 136 (3.8%) in HNSC, 133 (3.7%) in ESCA, 89 (2.5%) in THCA, and 73 (2%) in PRAD.

The percentage is related to total transcripts annotated (left panel). DEGs shared between CC, RC respect to 16 different tumor types. The percentage is related to DEGs of tr-COAD (5394) and DEGs of tr-READ (3559), respectively (right panel) The observed differences among normal tissues were in the range of 0.04–21%. The most similar normal tissues were the mucosa from the colon and rectal epithelium, with only 16 different transcripts (0.04%) followed by normal stomach mucosa [521 different transcripts (1.5%) versus colon, and 417 different transcripts (1.2%) versus rectum, respectively]. Conversely, the epithelium from the biliary ducts was the most distant from both colon epithelium [7347 different transcripts (21%)] and rectal epithelium [4179 different transcripts (12%)]. Subsequently, we compared the DEGs identified in CC and/or in RC with the DEGs present in the databases derived from each of the other 16 tumor types. We observed that, although the transcriptional profiles of CC and RC were more similar to each other than to any other tumor, they differed significantly in terms of DEGs. CC presented 56% of DEG difference compared with RC (Fig. 4 B). Of the other tumors analyzed, LUAD, LUSC, BRCA and KICH were the most similar to CC (14–18% of DEGs in common) while HNSC, LIHC, PRAD, ESCA, BLCA and THCA were the least similar (4–8% of DEGs in common) (Additional file 4 ). On the other hand, RC presented 33% of DEG difference compared with CC (Fig. 4 B). The average expression profile of RC was most similar in terms of DEGs to KICH, LUSC and GBM (8–9% of DEGs in common) and least similar to STAD, LIHC, HNSC, ESCA, THCA and PRAD (2–4% of DEGs in common) (Additional file 5 ). Interestingly, the tumor transcriptional profile closest to CC and/or RC was observed in lung adenocarcinoma (18% to CC and 9% to RC, respectively) while the most distant transcriptional profile was observed in thyroid carcinoma (5% to CC and 2.5% to RC, respectively) (Fig. 4 B). Comparative analysis of the transcriptional profiles of CC and RC Subsequently, we focused on the comparative expression analysis between CC and RC. Data from colorectal cancer samples (n = 647) and the corresponding normal tissues present in the TCGA database were divided into tr-COAD (n = 481) or tr-READ (n = 166) transcriptional datasets. We identified 5394 DEGs (1343 down-regulated, 4051 up-regulated) in tr-COAD and 3559 DEGs (1612 down-regulated, 1947 up-regulated) in tr-READ (False Discovery Rate, FDR < 0.05; |Log2(Fold Change, FC)|> 2) (Additional file 2 , Sheets 1, 2). See the HeatMap in Fig. 5 A. Fig. 5 Comparative transcriptomic analysis between CC and RC. A Heatmap using normalized counts that depict the different expression patterns from CC patients present in the COAD and RC patients present in the READ TCGA datasets, respectively. Each row represents a tumor sample (COAD in yellow, READ in purple) and each column represents a gene. In the heatmap, red indicates high expression and green indicates low expression. B Venn diagram of DEGs. The number present in each circle represents the DEGs identified in the COAD dataset and/or those identified in the READ dataset (CC DEGs, navy; RC DEGs, red). The number in the middle represents DEGs common to CC and RC. CC Colon Cancer, RC Rectal Cancer, TCGA The Cancer Genome Atlas, DEGs Differentially Expressed Genes DEGs common to tr-COAD and tr-READ were 2392 (978 down-regulated, 1414 up-regulated), of which 2 behaved divergently in the two datasets (Additional file 2 , Sheet 3) ( H2AC13 and SMLR1 ) and were excluded from further analysis. The 2390 DEGs in common between CC and RC represented 44% of the 5394 DEGs in tr-COAD and 67% of the 3559 DEGs identified in tr-READ (Additional file 2 , Sheet 3). See Venn diagram in Fig. 5 B. On the other hand, DEGs that were exclusively deregulated in tr-COAD were 3002 (56%, 365 down-regulated, 2637 up-regulated), while DEGs that were exclusively deregulated in tr-READ were 1167 (33%, 634 down-regulated, 533 up-regulated) (Additional file 2 , Sheet 4). In conclusion, the systematic transcriptomic comparison performed here revealed that unlike normal colon and rectal mucosa, which showed minimal divergence in terms of differentially transcribed genes, CC and RC presented a significantly number of different DEGs between them (in the range of 33–56%), suggesting that different genes play a role in the colon or rectal epithelium during tumor onset and/or progression. Signaling pathways altered in CC and/or RC Subsequently, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of DEGs present in both COAD and READ highlighted cancer-related signaling pathways that resulted inappropriately altered in both CC and RC. Up-regulated DEGs enriched for 22 KEGG canonical pathways while down-regulated DEGs enriched for 43 KEGG canonical pathways ( p -value ≤ 0.05, Additional file 2 , sheet 5). In particular, genes dysregulated in both CC and RC enriched for pathways frankly related to cancer and/or to pathways associated to cancer growth (mTOR signaling pathway), cell adhesion ( cell adhesion molecules, gap junction ), regulation of stem cell fate ( signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, Wnt signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway), tumor microenvironment and metastasis (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signalling pathways), and/or to neuronal signalling (dopaminergic synapse, serotonergic synapse, glutamatergic synapse) ( p -value ≤ 0.05, Additional file 2 , sheet 5) (Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6 Gene expression signatures of samples present in COAD and READ. A DotPlot of representative KEGG canonical pathways from DEGs common to CC and RC classified as down-regulated (DN) and up-regulated (UP). B Barcharts of GSEA categories significantly enriched for DEGs identified exclusively in CC or RC (NES ≤ 0.05). Categories positively regulated exclusively in CC included transcription factors’ activity (i.e. MYC targets , Bound by E2F4 ), mechanisms involved in DNA repair and preservation of genome stability (i.e. BRCA1 network , ATM signaling , Telomere maintenance ) and response to chemotherapy (i.e. Cisplatin response ). Categories negatively regulated exclusively in RC included signaling from transcription factors ( EED targets , Bound by MYC, PAX3-FOXO1 enhancers, ESR1 targets down, Bound by SALL4 ), transcriptional modulators ( HDAC1 and HDAC2 targets down, APC targets down ), stem cell features ( Stem cell up ). Categories regulated positively in CC but negatively in RC included cell proliferation and differentiation ( Regulation of cell population proliferation, RB1 and TP53 targets down, Positive regulation of cell differentiation ), inflammation ( Inflammatory response, Abnormal morphology of great vessels), stem cell characteristics ( NANOG targets ) and RNA metabolism ( Positive regulation of RNA metabolic process ). C Barchart of GSEA categories significantly enriched for DEGs identified exclusively in CC or in RC (NES ≤ 0.05). Categories negatively regulated in both CC and RC included epigenetic changes ( SUZ12 targets, H3 unmethylated ), immune response ( Regulation of immune system process, Abnormal inflammatory response ), cell differentiation ( Cellular component morphogenesis, Cellular morphogenesis involved in neuron differentiation, Cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation ), response to stimuli ( Signaling by GPCR, Response to lipid, Cellular response to hormone stimulus ), regulation of membrane transport ( Chemical homeostasis, Ion transmembrane transport, Metal ion transport , Regulation of transmembrane transport ), and cancer signature ( Breast cancer basal DN ). Blue bars, COAD enriched categories; red bars, READ enriched categories. KEGG Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, GSEA Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, CC Colon Cancer, RC Rectal Cancer, NES Normalized Enriched Score On the other hand, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis performed on CC- and RC-private DEGs allowed the identification of significant distinctive differences that discriminated CC from RC. CC-private DEGs highlighted 315 pathways (119 up-regulated and 196 down-regulated) while RC-private DEGs highlighted 316 pathways (2 up-regulated and 314 down-regulated), respectively. Notably, 212 pathways were specific of CC, while 213 pathways were specific of RC (67%). As shown in the barchart in Fig. 6 B, the GSEA categories that were significantly enriched by CC- and/or RC-private DEGs were of four types: (i) categories positively regulated exclusively in CC (n = 90); (ii) categories negatively regulated in both CC and RC (n = 74) (Fig. 6 C); (iii) categories negatively regulated specifically in RC (n = 211); (iv) categories positively regulated in CC but negatively regulated in RC (n = 29) (Additional file 2 , sheet 6). Overall, these results indicated that while, on one hand, CC and RC shared several common pathways related to cancer development such as Wnt-, mTOR-, Hippo-, IL-17 signalling pathways, they presented significant differences as to their transcriptional programs. In particular, we observed that pathways correlated with cell proliferation such as MYC signalling ( MYC targets up , bound by MYC down ) as well as those correlated with multiplication of cancer stem cells ( Telomere maintainance, Targets of EZH2 and NANOG ) were positively regulated in CC, which was also consistent with the down-regulation of RB1 and TP53 targets. Conversely, we found no evidence of enhancement of pathways related to stem cells in RC (i. e. Telomere maintainance, Targets of EZH2 and NANOG , Stem cells UP ), with conflicting regulation of the signalling from the transcription factors NANOG and ESR1, the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and the histone deacetylase HDAC1/2 in CC and in RC. RC segregated into two distinct transcriptional groups: cluster type 1 and cluster type 2 A relevant observation that derived from the analysis of the expression profiles of the patients present in the tr-COAD and tr-READ databases, was the presence of two main clusters of RC patients named Cluster 1 (121 patients) and Cluster 2 (27 patients), respectively (Additional file 2 , sheet 7). As shown in the heatmap of Fig. 5 A, the RC present in the two clusters segregated almost completely from the remaining RC (18 patients) and from all CC (481 patients). Cluster 1-type tumors were characterized by transcripts present within Block1 or Block4, while Cluster 2-type tumors were characterized by transcripts present within Blocks 2, 3 and 4. These areas are shown as frames in Figure S3. Block1 included 909 up-regulated genes, Block2 included 276 up-regulated genes, Block3 included 516 up-regulated genes while Block4 included 118 up-regulated genes, respectively (Additional file 2 , sheet 8). To investigate the molecular basis of the observed clustering of RC, we first matched the transcriptional profiles of Cluster 1-type and Cluster 2-type RC with their mutational profiles. Significant differences were observed in the frequency of single gene mutations in Cluster 1- and Cluster 2-type RC in key genes like KRAS (49.5% vs 26%, respectively), PI3KCA (20% vs 8.7%, respectively) and NRAS (7.4% vs 0, respectively) but not in APC (90% vs 82%, respectively) or TP53 (77% vs 78%, respectively). Overall, almost half of Cluster 1-type RC were simultaneously mutant for APC , KRAS , NRAS and TP53 or for APC and PI3KCA , a genetic asset observed more frequently in Cluster 1-type than in Cluster 2-type RC. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the DEGs within Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, shown as a tree-plot in Figure S4, underscored significant differences between Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 RC (Additional file 2 , sheet 9). DEGs within Block 1 enriched pathways implicated in cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage response (Fig. S4A) while DEGs within Block4 showed a significant enrichment of pathways involved in signaling from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), adenylate cyclase and other second messengers such as the cyclic nucleotides or calcium (Fig. S4B) . On the other hand, DEGs within Blocks 2, 3 and 4 of Cluster 2-type RC enriched for categories that included neuronal pathways , ion metabolism and transport and tissue development (Fig. S4C) (Additional file 2 , sheet 9). Finally, we superimposed the observed clustering of CC and RC to the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) (Fig. 7 A), a transcriptomic-based classification of colorectal cancer elaborated by Guinney and coworkers [ 28 ] that include five consensus molecular subtypes: CMS1/MSI/immune characterized by microsatellite instability, hypermutation and strong immune activation; CMS2/canonical characterized by epithelial features and marked Wnt and MYC signaling activation; CMS3/metabolic characterized by epithelial features and frank metabolic dysregulation; CMS4/mesenchymal characterized by prominent transforming growth factor–β activation, stromal invasion and angiogenesis; samples with mixed features [ 28 ].

Color saturation indicates statistical significance; red and blue indicate direction of pathway regulation. CMS Consensus Molecular Subtypes, CC Colon Cancer, RC Rectal Cancer, GSEA Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Upon application of the CMS classification to the tr-COAD and tr-READ datasets we found that, in comparison with CC, RC were underrepresented in the CMS1-MSI/immune group ( n = 15, 8.5% vs 17%) but not in CMS2/canonical group ( n = 39, 22% vs 29%), CMS3/metabolic (n = 31, 18% vs 17%) or CMS4/mesenchymal ( n = 59, 33% vs 29%) groups (Fig. 7 B). However, Cluster 2-type RC were predominantly CMS4/mesenchymal (n = 23, 85%) and/or CMS3/metabolic (n = 3, 11%) while Cluster 1-type RC were more homogeneously distributed among CMS1/MSI/immune (n = 13, 11%), CMS2/canonical (n = 37, 31%), CMS3/metabolic (n = 18, 15%) and CMS4/ mesenchymal (n = 23, 19%). See Fig. 7 C. The observed differential distribution of CC and RC suggests not only that these tumor types present significant differences in MS stability, BRAF mutation, immune activation and/or mesenchymal characteristics, but provides also a molecular basis for the observed clustering of RC. Clinical significance of cluster type 1 and cluster type 2 RC To determine the clinical significance of the observed clustering of RC, we first investigated whether Cluster 1-type and Cluster 2-type RC showed specific clinical-pathological characteristics that distinguished them from the remaining tumors (CC or remaining RC). The unique significant finding that derived from this analysis was the correlation with lymphatic invasion in Cluster 1-type RC tumors (χ2 test < 0.02), which suggested that RC patients with Cluster 1-type tumors are possibly more prone to lymphatics invasion. Subsequently, we determined the potential role of Cluster 1- and 2-specific DEGs in OS by use of survival [ 46 ] and survminer [ 47 ] packages. By applying the log-rank test to Kaplan–Meier curves we identified 9 genes that predicted survival within Block1 DEGs as independent prognostic markers: 6 were processed pseudogenes [the ATP Synthase F1 Subunit Epsilon Pseudogene 2 ( ATP5F1EP2), the pseudogenes encoding two heat shock proteins (HSP90AB3P, HSPD1P1), the Chromobox Homolog 3 Pseudogene 9 ( CBX3P9 ), the Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide F Pseudogene 1 (SNRPFP1), and the Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 1A, X-Linked Pseudogene 1 ( EIF1AXP1 )]; two were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA, LINC01356, GATA2-AS1 ); one was a protein coding gene ( C2 calcium dependent domain containing 4B , C2CD4B ). (Fig. 8 A). Fig. 8 Univariate and multivariate analysis showing prognostic value. A Kaplan–Meier survival plots for the indicated DEGs. The p -values were computed by log-rank test. B Forest plot based on the results of multivariate analysis of the associated genes with OS of Cluster 1-type RC patients. Global p- value (Log Rank): 0.00027245; AIC: 136.02; Concordance Index: 0.84. DEGs Differentially Expressed Genes, OS Overall Survival In addition, a unique DEG within Block2 ( CUB and Zona Pellucida Like Domains 1 , CUZD1 ) that encodes the protein CUZD1 was identified as independent prognostic marker for Cluster 2-type patients (Fig. 8 A). No DEG within Block 3 or 4 that predicted survival was identified. In summary, Cluster 1-type patients with high tumor expression of HSP90AB3P, HSPD1P1, CBX3P9, EIF1AXP1, LINC01356, GATA2-AS1 or C2CD4B or with low tumor expression of SNRPFP1 or ATP5F1EP2 showed poor OS; similarly, Cluster 2-type patients with low tumor expression of CUZD1 showed poor OS (Fig. 8 A). The DEGs that were found to be significant in univariate analysis were subsequently tested by use of a multivariate Cox regression model to build a prognostic classifier. The hazard ratio (HR) of each gene was calculated and was considered as high-risk factor for short survival time when HR > 1 or low risk when HR < 1 ( p -value ≤ 0.05). The results from the multivariate analysis are reported in the Forest plot in Fig. 8 B. Only EIF1AXP1 was excluded from the prognostic classifier in the multivariate Cox regression model because it was found to be an independent prognostic factor also for CC patients. In multivariate analysis for overall survival, simultaneous up-regulation of C2CD4B , HSPD1P1 , LINC01356 , CBX3P9 , GATA2-AS1 and down-regulation of ATP5F1EP2, HSP90AB3P and SNRPFP1 represented a multigene signature for Cluster 1-type RC ( p -value = 0.0005). On the basis of their behavior in RC, C2CD4B, HSPD1P1, LINC01356, CBX3P9, GATA2-AS1 were considered novel putative oncogenes while ATP5F1EP2, HSP90AB3P and SNRPFP1 were considered novel putative tumor suppressors. However, among the different clinical parameters analyzed, the association was significant only between up-regulation of C2CD4B in RC and the presence of metastases (M1) (Fisher test, p -value = 0.03). To validate our findings in a different cohort of patients, we conducted RT-qPCR analysis of 5 representative genes ( C2CD4B , HSPD1P1 , LINC01356 , CBX3P9 , and GATA2-AS1 ), among those that collectively define the multigene signature associated with overall survival in Cluster 1-type RC patients. The analysis was performed on tumor samples from 14 RC patients enrolled at the University of Catanzaro. Comparison of gene expression levels between RC and normal mucosa samples revealed that upregulation was restricted to a subset of patients. Specifically, high expression of all 5 genes in the Cluster 1 signature was observed in 64% (9/14) RC patients (Fig. S5A and S5B). Among the remaining 5 patients, three exhibited overexpression of HSPD1P1, either alone or in combination with C2CD4B and/or CBX3P9 , while two showed no significant differential expression compared to normal controls (Fig. S5A and S5B). Although based on a small patient cohort, these results closely parallel observation in the TCGA dataset where 72% RC patients (121/166) showed simultaneous upregulation of all five genes within the Cluster 1 signature. Comparative analysis of pseudogene expression in COAD and READ In the last part of the study, we performed a comparative analysis in the expression of pseudogenes in CC and RC because of the recent experimental evidence suggests an active pseudogenes’ role in cancer development [ 48 – 52 ]. In the setting of colorectal cancer, the pattern of pseudogene expression presented significant differences between CC and RC (Fig. S5A and S5B). Definition of the potential activity of pseudogenes was performed by evaluating active RNA polymerase II (Pol2) binding sites and pseudogene active chromatin (AC) promoter regions using the GENCODE pseudogene resource [ 53 ]. The analysis showed that 25% of CC private DEGs (768 out of 3002) and 10% of RC private DEGs (126 out of 1167) were expressed pseudogenes. Conversely, 9% of common DEGs (317 out of the 2392) were expressed pseudogenes (Additional file 6 , sheets 1, 2, 3). Notably pseudogenes in CC were more frequently associated with an active chromatin state (653 pseudogenes identified in tr-COAD and 108 pseudogenes identified in tr-READ, respectively) and maintained more numerous active RNA polymerase II binding sites compared to those identified in RC (35 pseudogenes identified in tr-COAD and 5 pseudogenes identified in tr-READ, respectively) (Additional file 6 , sheets 1, 2, 3). These results further indicate that CC and RC present significant differences also in regard to the expression of pseudogenes, thus suggesting the existence of different mechanisms whereby the normal transcriptional circuits are subverted in these two types of cancer . Discussion Colorectal cancer represents the second cause of cancer-related deaths in the western world [ 54 ]. So far, most studies have considered colorectal cancer as a single entity, without further distinction between cancers originating from the colon and those originating from the rectum. However, although CC and RC are characterized by relevant differences in the epidemiological, biological and clinical characteristics [ 20 ], relatively few studies have addressed the molecular basis of such differences [ 41 , 42 , 55 ]. In this manuscript we have performed an integrated analysis of chromosomal alterations, gene mutations, transcriptional signatures using data available in public CC and RC databases (COAD and READ databases from TCGA, respectively). The results highlighted significant differences in the genomic, and transcriptomic profiles between RC and CC, which suggested the existence of divergent routes of cancer development. CC and RC presented copy number alterations (CNAs) distributed along all chromosomes. As to CC focal aberrations were identified in 30 chromosomal regions while large-scale alterations were identified in 13 regions. As to RC focal aberrations were identified in 19 regions while large-scale alterations were identified in 7 regions. Overall, somatic CNAs identified in this study confirmed the pattern of chromosomal changes reported in previous studies [ 56 ]. Significant gains were observed at 8p (which includes ANK1 ), 8q (which includes CASC8 and POU5F1B ) and 13q (which includes USP12 ). Despite not fitting the classical definition of oncogenes, also the genes CASC8 , USP12, and POU5F1B exhibit significant roles in colon cancer through their regulation of cell proliferation , chemoresistance and metastasis [ 57 , 58 ]. On the other hand, significant deletions were observed at 1p (which includes ARID1A and HMGN2 ), 4q, 5q (which includes APC ), 8p (which includes CSMD1 ), 15q (which includes SMAD3 ), 18q (which includes SMAD4 ) and 20p (which includes FLRT3 ). In addition, tumor suppressor genes such as FHIT (3p14.2), RBFOX1 (16p13.3), and PARK2 (6q26) were also found to be frequently deleted. Although numerous altered chromosomal regions were shared, 50% of the genomic alterations observed in CC and 25% of the genomic alterations observed in RC were private, indicating the existence of a substantial difference in genomic alterations between these tumor types. CC-private aberrant chromosomal regions identified in this study included both focal (gains at 8p11.23, 12p13.33, 13q22.1, 19q13.11, 20p11.21, 20p11.23; losses at 8p22, 10q23.31, 15q21.1, 16q23.1, 18q12.2, 22q13.32) and large-scale alterations (gains at 6p21.1, 17q24.1, 20q12; losses at 1p13.1, 4q35.1, 5q21.1, 10q25.2, 15q11.2, 15q15.2, 18q22.1). Interestingly, our study suggests that MYC (8q) is exclusively amplified in CC, with copy number gains of chromosome 8 being associated with lymph node and distant metastases in CC [ 59 ]. Among the CC-private alterations we observed the deletion of 10q23.31 that included the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, likely resulting in PTEN deficiency, with consequent elevated PI3K signalling, high levels of reactive oxygen species, increased endogenous DNA damage and constitutive ATM activation [ 60 ]. Accordingly, we observed the transcriptional activation of an ATM network in CC-exclusive DEGs. Furthermore, site-specific focal amplification of TEAD 4 (12p13.33) and KLF5 (13q22.1) in CC suggest these genes play a substantial role in the molecular pathogenesis of colon-derived tumors. Their involvement of these genes in critical oncogenic pathways (i.e. Hippo for TEAD4 and Wnt/EGFR-MAPK for KLF5 , respectively) indicates that they may represent diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic biomarkers in CC [ 57 , 61 ]. RC-private aberrant chromosomal regions were less numerous and included both focal (gains: 12p12.1, 13q12.2; losses: 20q13.12) and/or large-scale (gains: 20q11.23; losses: 14q11.2, 21q11.2, 22q13.31) alterations. Among RC-private alterations there was the CN gain at 12p12.1, which included the KRAS oncogene, a biomarker predicting negative outcome for treatment of metastatic RC [ 62 ]. Moreover, the almost exclusive focal amplification of CDX2 at 13q12.2 observed in 83% of RC reinforces the concept that RC follows a distinct molecular pathway. Its amplification aligns with RC-specific patterns of transcriptional regulation, epithelial lineage dependence, and immune or stromal interactions, particularly in mesenchymal-like (CMS4) and metabolic-like (CMS3) subtypes enriched in the identified RC clusters. Significant differences in the mutational profiles of RC and CC were also identified. The first observation is that the number of mutations was significantly higher in CC compared with RC (0.51/Mb vs 0.28/Mb), in agreement with the finding that microsatellite instability is frequently observed in CC but not in RC. Accordingly, the absolute number of identified variants and mutated genes was significantly higher (> 25%) in CC than in RC. Moreover, although ultramutated cancers are found both in CC and RC, POLE mutations were more frequent in CC (8%, 32/406) than in RC (4%, 6/106) [ 63 , 64 ]. In agreement with previous studies [ 65 ], our analysis identified 17 recurrently mutated genes that were common to both CC and RC, including APC (71% CC; 80% RC), TP53 (55% CC; 73% RC), KRAS (43% CC and RC), TTN (51% CC; 43% RC), PIK3CA (31% CC; 15% RC), FBXW7 (16.5% CC; 18% RC) SMAD4 (12% CC; 15% RC), NRAS (5% CC; 10% RC), TCF7L2 (11% CC; 9% RC), SMAD2 (5% CC and RC), CTNNB1 (7% CC; 5% RC), SOX9 (14% CC; 7% RC), and EDNRB (4% CC; 3% RC). On the basis of the combinations and the frequency of gene mutations we observed that tumors originating in the rectum usually develops through the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway. Conversely, tumors originating in the colon are more heterogeneous and may develop either through the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway or the serrated-methylation neoplasia pathway. CC that develops through the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway (60% of total CC) are initiated by biallelic APC alterations and exhibit CIN, MS stability, absence of CIMP, wild-type or mutant KRAS , wild-type BRAF and mutations in key genes such as PI3KCA , SMAD4 and/or TP53 . Conversely, CC developing via the serrated pathways (25–30%) are heterogeneous in terms of molecular patterns and cannot easily be classified based on characteristic mutations, but rather by specific morphologic changes and are strongly associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance. A common feature of the serrated pathways is hyperactivation of the MAPKinase pathway due to mutations in KRAS , NRAS or BRAF and increased Wnt signaling due to different genetic alterations. In particular, tumors that develop along the traditional serrated neoplasia pathway have KRAS or NRAS mutations, are MS stable and are more often diagnosed in the left colon (distal). Aberrations associated with tumor progression along this pathway include RSPO3 fusions [ 66 , 67 ] and/or mutations of CTNNB1 [ 66 ] and APC [ 66 , 68 ]. Conversely, sessile serrated lesions present BRAF mutations, frequent RNF43 mutations, high frequency of methylation of the MLH1 promoter, which causes high MSI instability and occur in the right colon (proximal) [ 27 , 69 – 71 ]. On the other hand, approximately 43% of mutant genes identified in CC and 30% of mutant genes identified in RC in this study were private. Private driver genes identified in CC included ACVR1B (5.9%), LTBP4 (5.2%), and SETD1A (5.2%). Mutations in ACVR1B may contribute to dysregulate gene expression, thus promoting cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis [ 27 ]. Mutations of LTBP4 affect TGF-β signaling and have been associated with colorectal cancer in animal models suggesting potential relevance in human CRC. SETD1A mutations in CC can cause epigenetic dysregulation that, by inactivating tumor suppressor genes, promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis [ 72 ]. Private genes identified in RC included C4BPA , EHD1 and PPP3CC . C4BPA is a key regulator of the complement system, which modulates immune responses and inflammation implicated in promoting metastasis in colorectal cancer through complement regulation [ 73 ]. PPP3CC has been implicated in tumor suppression via the calcineurin–NFAT pathway, thus affecting tumor immune escape [ 74 ]. However, our results revealed significant differences in the mutation frequencies of certain genes between CC and RC. For example, PTPRS (5 × more frequent in CC), CDH10 (5 × more frequent in CC), DNAH1 (5 × more frequent in CC), BRAF (4 × more frequent in CC), PIK3CA (2 × more frequent in CC) and ZFHX4 (2 × more frequent in CC) were more frequently mutated in CC; while TP53 (30% more frequent in RC) and NRAS (2.5 × more frequent in RC) were more frequently mutated in RC. Notably, the finding that ACVR1B (6 × fold more frequent in CC), GPC6 (4 × fold more frequent in CC) and SOX9 (2 × fold more frequent in CC) were more frequently mutated in CC suggested that TGF-β dysregulation ( ACVR1B ), Wnt pathway modulation ( GPC6 ), and stem-like transcriptional reprogramming ( SOX9 ) occurred more often in colon tumorigenesis [ 75 – 77 ]. Finally, the comparative analysis of the transcriptomic data indicated that CC differed significantly from RC, both in term of protein-encoding genes both in term of the characteristics comprised in the CMS classification, including MSI status, BRAF mutation, immune activation and/or mesenchymal characteristics and of pseudogenes, thus suggesting the existence of different mechanisms whereby the normal transcriptional circuits are subverted during the development of these two types of cancer . First, at difference with normal colon and rectal mucosa, which showed minimal difference in terms of transcripts, CC and RC presented significant divergence in term of protein-encoding genes (56% of the DEGs identified in CC and 33% of the DEGs identified in RC were private) and of pseudogenes (7% of transcribed pseudogenes in CC and 1.1% in RC). Second, GSEA analysis performed on CC- and RC-private DEGs allowed the identification of significant distinctive differences in the transcriptional programs of CC and RC that deserve further studies. Accordingly, the pathways involved in cell proliferation and/or expansion of cancer stem cells such as MYC , RB1 or TP53 signalling resulted abnormally regulated in CC while RC showed divergent regulation of the activity of transcription factors ( NANOG, ESR1 ) , histone methyltransferases ( EZH2) and histone deacetylases ( HDAC1/2 ). On the other hand, KEGG analysis of the DEGs that were shared between CC and RC highlighted numerous cancer-related signaling pathways that resulted inappropriately altered in both cancer types. In particular, the genes that were dysregulated in both CC and RC enriched for pathways frankly related to cancer such as cancer growth, regulation of stem cell fate , tumor microenvironment and metastasis , and/or to neuronal signalling. Overall, CC and RC shared several common pathways related to cancer development such as Wnt-, mTOR-, Hippo-, IL-17 signalling pathways. An additional important finding was that, at difference with CC, the majority of RC clusterized into two different transcriptional tumor types (Cluster 1-type and Cluster 2-type) that segregated almost completely from all CC and, accordingly, presented significant molecular and clinical differences. In term of mutated genes, Cluster 1-type RC were preferentially mutant for APC / KRAS / TP53 , APC / NRAS / TP53 or APC / PI3KCA and were more prone to lymphatics invasion whereas, in term of transcriptomic profiles, Cluster 2-type RC were enriched in the CSM3/metabolic and CSM4/mesenchymal type. In particular, Cluster 1-type RC were characterized by the presence of 2 blocks of DEGs (Blocks 1 and 4) whereas Cluster 2-type RC were characterized by the presence of 3 blocks of DEGs (Blocks 2–4). GO analysis of RC underscored significant differences between Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 tumors. DEGs typical of Cluster 1-type RC revealed an enrichment in pathways related to cell cycle , including genes like UBD associated with tumor size and TNM stage [ 27 ], PTTG2 implicated in cell-cycle regulation [ 27 , 78 ] as well as C2CD4B , involved in the regulation of cell architecture, adhesion and inflammation (Block 1), or a significant enrichment of pathways involved in signaling from GPCRs, adenylate cyclase and/or other second messengers such as the cyclic nucleotides or calcium (Block4). This is of particular relevance in terms of potential therapeutic targets, because GPCRs represent a large family of membrane receptors that regulate several cancer-associated processes, including proliferation, migration and invasion [ 79 – 81 ]. The genes encoding GPCRs that were up-regulated in Block 4 included GPR12, an orphan receptor implicated in Vulvar Dystrophy and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome [ 82 ] ADGRG4 implicated in angiogenesis and migration of colorectal cancer cells [ 83 ], FXYD1, a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in excitable tissues that regulates the Na + /K + ATPase [ 84 ] and P2RX2 , a member of the family of ligand-gated ion channel family that open in response to extracellular ATP implicated in response to hypoxia [ 85 ]. On the other hand, analysis of DEGs within the blocks typical of Cluster 2-type RC (Blocks 2, 3 and 4), enriched for categories that included neuronal pathways , ion metabolism and transport and tissue development. DEGs up-regulated in Blocks 2–4 included SOX10 implicated in development of central and peripheral nervous system [ 86 ], SLIT2 implicated in the regulation of neuronal guidance and cell migration in colorectal cancer [ 87 ] and RIMS4 implicated in synaptic membrane exocytosis and ion channel binding [ 88 , 89 ]. As anticipated above, CC and RC presented significant differences also in the expression of pseudogenes and of their corresponding parental genes. The analysis showed that 25% of the identified CC-private DEGs and 10% of the identified RC-private DEGs were pseudogenes. In particular, in CC pseudogene DEGs were more frequently associated with an active chromatin state (sixfold more numerous) and maintained more numerous active RNA polymerase II binding sites (sevenfold more numerous) compared to pseudogene DEGs identified in RC. Recent studies have highlighted that pseudogenes, once considered transcriptionally inert, can exert functional roles in cancer biology through various mechanisms. Many pseudogenes act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), sequestering shared microRNAs and thereby regulating the expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressors [ 90 ]. Additionally, pseudogenes have been shown to interfere with chromatin dynamics by recruiting epigenetic modifiers such as EZH2, altering histone methylation and transcriptional repression [ 91 ]. In CRC, pseudogenes have been implicated in modulating key oncogenic pathways. For instance, the pseudogene CSPG4P12 has been shown to inhibit CRC progression by attenuating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role [ 92 ]. DUSP5P1 has been shown to promote gastric cancer metastasis by directly modulating ARHGAP5 expression to activate focal adhesion and MAPK pathways [ 93 ]. The pseudogenes identified in our analysis, including PTTG3P and PA2G4P4 , exhibited distinct transcriptional activity in CC and RC, respectively. Although these pseudogenes have not previously been associated with CC or RC, they are already known to play roles in cancer-related processes and may participate in key regulatory networks. Similarly, PTTG3P has been shown to dysregulate TP53 signaling in coordination with PTTG1 and PTTG2, contributing to tumor progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [ 78 ]. PA2G4P4 enhances the expression and nuclear translocation of its parental oncogene PA2G4, promoting cell viability and inhibiting apoptosis in glioblastoma [ 94 ]. However, further investigation will be necessary to validate their functional roles and assess their potential translational relevance in CC and RC. Finally, the present study also contributed to identify significant differences in the predictive values of specific biomarkers between CC and RC. Studies reporting analysis of correlation of mutational status with survival and/or other clinical characteristics have often reported conflicting results [ 95 – 97 ]. For example, mutations in APC , TP53 , PIK3CA , BRAF , SCN5A and/or FBXW7 have been associated with an aggressive behaviour as to stage, nodal status, vascular invasion and distant metastasis in some studies [ 95 , 97 ] but not in others [ 98 , 99 ]. On the contrary, the analysis reported here showed that CC patients with mutant APC , KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , PI3KCA or TP53 (or any combinations thereof) showed no difference in survival in comparison with patients without mutations. Similarly, we failed to find a specific genetic asset that predicted OS in RC patients. The only significant genetic assets that showed a predictive value for OS in CC were the co-occurrence of mutations in APC and BRAF or in APC , KRAS and PIK3CA . Accordingly, in vivo modelling of APC and BRAF mutations revealed an aggressive phenotype with significant reduction in OS [ 68 , 100 ]. On the other hand, among the different findings of this study, we have observed a prognostic role for the TTN -encoded titin protein in colon cancer progression. In fact, loss of function TTN mutations in combination with mutated APC and/or KRAS markedly reduced survival in CC patients. Accordingly, TTN is one of the most frequently mutated genes in CRC and other solid tumors [ 101 , 102 ], and the down-regulation of TTN mRNA and protein expression has been frequently reported in CRC, which correlated with clinical stage, node metastasis, histological type and TP53 mutation. The adverse impact of TTN on prognosis is largely attributed to its association with chemotherapy resistance [ 103 ], the exact mechanisms of which need further investigation. Based on the data of gene set enrichment analysis, the ERB pathway might be responsible for TTN-related CRC. As to transcriptional biomarkers, we identified a signature of 9 genes within Block1 DEGs that predicted OS of RC patients. Among these, 6 were processed pseudogenes ( ATP5F1EP2, HSP90AB3P, HSPD1P1, CBX3P9 , SNRPFP1 and EIF1AXP1 ), two were lncRNA, ( LINC01356, GATA2-AS1 ) and one was a protein coding gene ( C2CD4B ). Patients with high tumor expression of HSP90AB3P, HSPD1P1, CBX3P9, EIF1AXP1, LINC01356, GATA2-AS1 or C2CD4B or with low tumor expression of SNRPFP1, ATP5F1EP2 showed poor OS. It is of note that a subsequent multivariate analysis showed that the simultaneous up-regulation of C2CD4B , HSPD1P1 , LINC01356 , CBX3P9 , GATA2-AS1 and down-regulation of ATP5F1EP2, HSP90AB3P, and SNRPFP1 were subsequently confirmed as a multigene signature for OS of Cluster 1-type RC patients also in multivariate analysis. Accordingly, RT-qPCR analysis performed on a different cohort of patients confirmed the in silico results, showing an upregulation of 5 representative genes in 64% of RC patients from an internal cohort of RC patients, closely resembling the frequency of upregulation observed in the TCGA dataset (72% upregulation of all five genes within the Cluster 1 signature). In conclusion we report robust evidence that CC and RC are distinct molecular entities, rather than subtypes of a single disease. Despite some overlapping features, this analysis highlights substantial differences in their genomic landscapes, mutational profiles, transcriptomic programs and clinical associations, supporting the notion that CC and RC follow divergent tumorigenic trajectories. This distinction is essential for improving personalized medicine strategies, biomarker development, and targeted therapeutic interventions. Future research should focus on functionally validating these private alterations, refining subtype classifications, particularly within RC, and exploring drug responses in context of the identified molecular distinctions to better tailor treatment options and improve patient outcomes. Limitations and future directions The present study is based exclusively on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which, while offering comprehensive multi-omic profiling and ensuring internal consistency, represents a limitation in terms of external validation. The absence of independent dataset validation may impact the generalizability of the results, particularly regarding site-specific alterations in CC and RC, though the validation performed for the 9-gene signature confirm the general value of the results. Materials and methods Data source selection and processing Data from a total of 556 tumor samples derived from colon adenocarcinoma patients (406) and rectal adenocarcinoma patients (150) were obtained from the TCGA Data Portal ( https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp ). For the pan-cancer analyses, 33 datasets from the TCGA database were downloaded for the study. Expression data derived from human primary cancers for which healthy samples were not available were discarded. The datasets containing at least 10 healthy samples (“Solid Tissue Normal” in the TCGA database) were selected. According to this criterion, 16 tumor types were analyzed and the datasets selected are summarized in Table 1 . Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method and Euclidean distance was employed to define the global gene expression patterns across all the CC and RC patients. Copy number analysis CNAs were identified from TCGA Level 3 segmented copy number profiles, generated from the same pipeline for hg38. Along with Mutation Annotation Format (MAF), Maftools was used for CN analysis and visualization of GISTIC output results. Briefly, GISTIC2.0 assigns to each gene of every sample a threshold of CN level that reflects the magnitude of its deletion or amplification. Somatic variant analysis Somatic variants in MAF format from TCGA were downloaded for each CC and RC. Maftools (v. 2.4.12), R package [ 104 ] was used for integrative analysis of somatic variants. The tmb function was used to check the tumor mutation burden (TMB). Gene driver identification The benchmarking of mutational cancer driver genes was downloaded from the DriverDBv4 database [ 105 ]. The databases: Activedriver [ 105 ], Comet [ 106 ], Dawnrank [ 107 ], Dendrix [ 108 ], Driverml [ 109 ], Drivernet [ 110 ], E-driver [ 111 ], Ipac [ 105 ], Memo [ 112 ], Msea [ 113 ], Mutex [ 114 ], Mutsigcv [ 115 ], Netbox [ 116 ] and, oncodriveclust [ 117 ] were examined to retrieve driver genes. Driver genes were identified by PRODIGY algorithm which analyze the mutation and expression profiles for each of the patient selected in the study alongside with data on known pathways. Gene expression analysis Gene expression quantification, STAR counts, and clinical information were downloaded from TCGA using the R package TCGAbiolinks [ 118 ]. After normalization and filtering of the reads, the differential gene expression analysis was conducted following edgeR pipeline [ 119 ]. Multiple correction was performed through the application of the FDR method. We considered differentially expressed genes with a − 1 ≤ logFC ≥ 1, and a FDR ≤ 0.01. Gene signature analyses GO terms, KEGG Canonical Pathways and GSEA were defined by using R package clusterProfiler (v 3.8.1), R package DOSE (v 3.6.1), and R package org. Hs.eg.db (v 3.6.0). GSEA was performed using the fgsea() function in the fgsea package [ 120 ], applying the GO Biological Process (BP) (7,350 gene sets) gene set collections from MSigDB [ 121 ] (version 7.0) individually as signature gene sets with 1000 permutations. For GO BP, DEGs with FDR < 0.05 were selected, and GO terms with a p -value ≤ 0.05 were considered. CMS classification Patients were classified according to CMS by R package ‘CMScaller’ (v.2.0.1) [ 122 ], which utilizes a nearest-template prediction algorithm [ 123 ]. CMScaller provides CMS classification of RNA-sequencing gene expression data, including build-in functionalities such as gene set analyses to evaluate the classification. This method makes it possible to predict unique samples alone or within a series of samples and can be used for comparison across cohorts. Survival analysis Patients’ survival time and vital status were merged with differentially expressed genes. Survival R packages: survival, survminer, and survdiff were used for survival analysis. Kaplan–Meier (K–M) survival plots were generated using ggsurvplot function. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method setting survdiff log rank p -value < 0.05. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent prognostic genes identified. A cutoff p -value of 0.05 and a backward stepwise option were adopted for the analysis. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's instructions. qPCR assay was performed using Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a QuantStudio 12 K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences were: CBX3P9 forward (5′-GATGCTGCTGACAAACCAAGA-3′) and CBX3P9 reverse (5′-TCATACTTGCTTCTTTTGCCAGC-3′), C2CD4B forward (5′- GCTTGCAACCAGATCCAGAGA-3′), C2CD4B reverse (5′-GGATTGGAGACTCGAGCGTG -3′), GAPDH forward (5′-TCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCGA-3′) and GAPDH reverse (5′- GGGTCTTACTCCTTGGAGGC-3′), GATA2-AS1 forward (5′-GCTCTCAGGGAAGTGGCT AC-3′) and GATA2-AS1 reverse (5′-ACCCATCACTAGCAGGTCCT-3’), HSPD1P1 forward (5′-GACCAAAGACGATGCCATGC-3′) and HSPD1P1 reverse (5′-TCCCACCAAACTTCAG CACA-3′), LINC01356 forward (5′-CTTTCCACGCGCTTGTTTCG-3′) and LINC01356 reverse (5′-CCCAAGACGTAGAGCTTCCC-3′). Cycles of threshold (Ct) value for each target gene was determined using QuantStudio 12 K Flex Software (Applied Biosystems). The Ct value of GAPDH was used as an internal control. Relative expression differences were calculated using the 2 − ΔΔCt method [ 124 ]. Statistical analyses of biological validation experiments were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9 (GraphPad Software). Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Comparisons between two groups were conducted using Student’s t-test; differences with a p- value ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Pseudogenes annotation data Data relative to the pseudogenes have been downloaded by GENCODE ( https://www.gencodegenes.org/ ), integrating functional genomics data with specific expression levels, transcription factor and RNA polymerase II binding, and chromatin marks. The activity data associated with every pseudogene was retrieved by psiDR resource ( http://pseudogene.org/psidr/ ). Supplementary Information Additional file 1.

  "plain_text": "Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) encompasses tumors arising in the colon (CC) and rectum (RC), often treated as a single disease despite emerging evidence of biological divergence. Understanding the molecular differences between CC and RC is critical for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies. Methods We performed an integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of CC and RC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to investigate their degree of similarity and observed that these tumors present distinct molecular profiles, which suggest an evolution through divergent pathways. Comparative analyses included copy number alterations (CNAs), somatic mutations, driver gene prediction, differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and survival analysis. Results Chromosomal analyses revealed that 43% of focal and 77% of large-scale CNAs were specific of CC, while 10.5% and 57% were specific of RC with 8% of mutant genes unique to CC and 0.18% to RC. CC and RC presented distinct profiles of gene mutations, with CC showing significantly higher tumor mutational burden (0.51 muts/Mb vs 0.28 muts/Mb in RC). Distinct mutational signatures were identified, with CC characterized by a higher frequency of PIK3CA , BRAF , and DNAH1 mutations, while RC showed enrichment for TP53 and NRAS mutations. Importantly, analysis of predicted non-canonical driver genes identified ACVR1B , LTBP4 , SETD1A as CC-specific drivers and C4BPA , EHD1 as RC-specific drivers, underscoring divergent oncogenic mechanisms. However, the most substantial divergence was observed in transcriptomic profiling, with 56% and 33% of DEGs (in CC and RC, respectively) that were tumor-type specific. Notably, RC tumors segregated into two distinct transcriptional subtypes (Cluster 1 and Cluster 2), with Cluster 1 showed a more heterogeneous Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) distribution, while Cluster 2 enriched in CMS4 (mesenchymal) and CMS3 (metabolic) consensus molecular subtypes. Accordingly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed CC-specific upregulation of Wnt, MYC, and mTOR signaling pathways, and RC-specific enrichment of GPCR and neuronal development pathways. On the other hand, pseudogene expression was significantly higher in CC, suggesting differential mechanisms of transcriptional dysregulation. Finally, we identified an RC-specific multigene survival signature as a prognostic model involving upregulation of C2CD4B , HSPD1P1 , LINC01356 , CBX3P9 , GATA2-AS1 and downregulation of ATP5F1EP2 , HSP90AB3P and SNRPFP1 . Conclusions Collectively, our findings provide robust molecular evidence that CC and RC follow divergent oncogenic pathways, emphasizing the need for site-specific biomarker development and therapeutic targeting in colorectal cancer.
