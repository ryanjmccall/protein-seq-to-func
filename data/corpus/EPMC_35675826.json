  "abstract_text": "The ovarian-tumor-domain-containing deubiquitinases (OTUDs) block ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and are involved in diverse signaling pathways. We discovered a rare OTUD3 c.863G>A mutation in a family with an early age of onset of diabetes. This mutation reduces the stability and catalytic activity of OTUD3. We next constructed an experiment with Otud3<sup>-/-</sup> mice and found that they developed worse obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance than wild-type mice when challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD). We further found that glucose and fatty acids stimulate CREB-binding-protein-dependent OTUD3 acetylation, promoting its nuclear translocation, where OTUD3 regulates various genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation by stabilizing peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ). Moreover, targeting PPARδ using a specific agonist can partially rescue the phenotype of HFD-fed Otud3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We propose that OTUD3 is an important regulator of energy metabolism and that the OTUD3 c.863G>A is associated with obesity and a higher risk of diabetes.",
