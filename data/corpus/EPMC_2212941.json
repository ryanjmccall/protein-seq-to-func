    "abstract_text": "We have isolated a cDNA encoding the 84-kD subunit of NFIV. Tryptic peptide sequences were identified within the coding sequences, confirming its proper identity. The primary sequence of the protein is identical to that of the large subunit of the Ku autoantigen. A missing NFIV peptide sequence was identified within the sequence of the small subunit of Ku. In addition, the proteins are identical in immunological aspects. We suggest that the Ku and NFIV proteins are identical. This connection adds new biochemical data to our knowledge of the Ku autoantigen.",
