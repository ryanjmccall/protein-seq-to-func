  "abstract_text": "The ability to sense and respond to DNA damage is critical to maintenance of genomic stability and the prevention of cancer. In this study, we employed a genetic screen to identify a gene, NBA1 (new component of the BRCA1 A complex), that is required for resistance to ionizing radiation. The NBA1 protein localizes to sites of DNA damage and is required for G2/M checkpoint control. Proteomic analysis revealed that NBA1 is a component of the BRCA1 A complex, which also contains Brca1/Bard1, Abra1, RAP80, BRCC36, and BRE. NBA1 is required to maintain BRE and Abra1 abundance and for the recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage. In depth bioinformatics analysis revealed that the BRCA1 A complex bears striking similarities to the 19S proteasome complex. Furthermore, we show that four members of the BRCA1-A complex possess a polyubiquitin chain-binding capability, thus forming a complex that might facilitate the deubiquitinating activity of the deubiquitination enzyme BRCC36 or the E3 ligase activity of the BRCA1/BARD1 ligase. These findings provide a new perspective from which to view the BRCA1 A complex.",
