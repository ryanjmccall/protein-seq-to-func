    "abstract_text": "We have identified different members of one family affected by androgen insensitivity syndrome who have deletions of different exons of the X-linked androgen receptor (AR) gene. Two affected (XY) siblings have a deletion of exon E of the AR gene and their affected (XY) aunt has a normal exon E, but a deletion of exons F and G of the same gene. The mother and maternal grandmother of the children both carry the exon E deletion, but not the exon F, G deletion. Both deletions are 5 kb in length and have one breakpoint within a 200-bp region in intron 5; however, they extend in opposite directions. The probability that these two different deletions have arisen at random is extremely low, but the cause of this intriguing phenomenon remains to be found.",
