    "abstract_text": "BRCA1 (Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene 1) possesses an N-terminal Ring domain and tandem C-terminal BRCT motifs. While the Ring domain has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the BRCA1 BRCT domains specifically recognize phospho-serine motifs. Here, we demonstrate that BRCA1 Ring domain catalyzes CtIP ubiquitination in a manner that depends on a phosphorylation-mediated interaction between CtIP and BRCA1 BRCT domains. The BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination of CtIP does not target CtIP for degradation. Instead, ubiquitinated CtIP associates with chromatin following DNA damage and participates in G2/M checkpoint control. Thus, we propose that BRCA1 can regulate the functions of its substrates through nonproteasomal pathways that do not involve substrate degradation.",
