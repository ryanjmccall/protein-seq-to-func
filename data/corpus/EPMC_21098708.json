    "abstract_text": "Increasing evidence indicates the significance of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (\u03b2-PDGFR) signaling in prostate cancer (PCa). Accordingly, preclinical studies suggest the potential of \u03b2-PDGFR as a therapeutic target in metastatic PCa. However, a ligand responsible for \u03b2-PDGFR activation in PCa was unknown, and recent clinical trials with imatinib mesylate showed limited success due to normal tissue toxicity. Similarly, in spite of mounting evidence indicating the significance of matriptase in PCa, little is known about its substrates or molecular actions during PCa progression. Here, we identified PDGF-D as a ligand for \u03b2-PDGFR in PCa and discovered matriptase as its regulator. Matriptase activates PDGF-D by proteolytic removal of the CUB domain in a 2-step process, creating a hemidimer, followed by growth factor domain dimer (GFD-D) generation. Matriptase can deactivate PDGF-D by further proteolytic cleavage within the GFD, revealing its biphasic regulation. Importantly, PDGF-D/matriptase colocalization is accompanied with \u03b2-PDGFR phosphorylation in human PCa tissues. This study unveiled a novel signaling axis of matriptase/PDGF-D/\u03b2-PDGFR in PCa, providing new insights into functional interplay between serine protease and growth factor signaling networks.",
