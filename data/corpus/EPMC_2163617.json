    "abstract_text": "Database search using a bovine thymus ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase sequence indicated 54% sequence identity with the abundant human neuron-specific protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), which was then shown to possess the same activity [Wilkinson, Lee, Deshpande, Duerksen-Hughes, Boss & Pohl (1989) Science 246, 670-673]. A yeast counterpart of the enzyme is also known. The human PGP9.5 gene, described here, spans 10 kb, contains nine exons and displays 5' features some common to many genes and some common with neurofilament neuron-specific enolase and Thy-1-antigen gene 5' regions.",
