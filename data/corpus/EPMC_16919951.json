  "abstract_text": "Sensory ataxia with neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis represent the clinical triad of SANDO, a specific mitochondrial phenotype first reported in 1997 in association with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and mutations in POLG1 or more rarely in the C10orf2 (twinkle-helicase) gene. We report a 44-year-old man with SANDO who harboured two novel mutations (P648R/R807C) in the POLG1 gene.",
