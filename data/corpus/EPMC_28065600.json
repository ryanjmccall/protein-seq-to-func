    "abstract_text": "In mammalian cells, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Sirtuin (SIRT) are two families responsible for removing acetyl groups from acetylated proteins. Here, we describe protein deacetylation coupled with deacetylimination as a function of lysyl oxidase (LOX) family members. LOX-like 3 (Loxl3) associates with Stat3 in the nucleus to deacetylate and deacetyliminate Stat3 on multiple acetyl-lysine sites. Surprisingly, Loxl3 N-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) repeats, rather than the C-terminal oxidase catalytic domain, represent the major deacetylase/deacetyliminase activity. Loxl3-mediated deacetylation/deacetylimination disrupts Stat3 dimerization, abolishes Stat3 transcription activity, and restricts cell proliferation. In Loxl3-/- mice, Stat3 is constitutively acetylated and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T\u00a0cells are potentiated in Th17/Treg cell differentiation. When overexpressed, the SRCR repeats from other LOX family members can catalyze protein deacetylation/deacetylimination.\u00a0Thus, our findings delineate a hitherto-unknown mechanism of protein deacetylation and deacetylimination catalyzed by lysyl oxidases.",
