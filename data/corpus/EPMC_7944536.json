    "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a useful therapeutic agent in insulin resistant diabetes mellitus due to insulin receptor disease because of its hypoglycaemic effects through the IGF-I receptor. A girl with typical type A insulin resistant syndrome was treated with IGF-I for two years and the treatment was effective in ameliorating hyperglycaemia. Overproduction of testosterone in polycystic ovaries was aggravated with this treatment, however. Therefore, IGF-I treatment may be used for glycaemic control but with caution because of its possible side effect of aggravating hyperandrogenism in these patients.",
