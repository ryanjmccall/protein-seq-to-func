  "abstract_text": "<h4>Context</h4>PTEN, a tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23, develops somatic mutations in various tumours and tumour cell lines including brain, endometrium, prostate, breast, kidney, thyroid, liver, and melanoma.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the mutational profile of this gene further, as well as its role in tumour progression in melanoma. DESIGN, SETTINGS: We examined 21 metastatic melanoma samples for 10q23 allelic losses and PTEN sequence alterations. Additionally, we screened these samples for mutations in CDKN2A, a gene in which alterations are well documented in primary melanoma as well as in the germline of familial melanoma.<h4>Results</h4>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q23 was observed in 33% (7/21) of the samples tested. We identified four sequence alterations in PTEN (19%) and two in CDKN2A (9.5%). Of interest, only one case showed mutations in both genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data support the notion that PTEN alterations occur in some metastatic melanomas, and that mutation of this gene plays a role in the progression of some forms of melanoma.",
