    "abstract_text": "Specialized lipid microdomains in the cell plasma membrane, referred to as 'lipid rafts', are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol and have drawn considerable interest as platforms for the recruitment of signaling molecules. Despite numerous biochemical and cellular studies, debate persists on the size, lifetime and even the existence of lipid rafts, emphasizing the need for reliable lipid probes to study in situ membrane lipid organization. In this review, we summarize our recent data on living cells using two specific probes of raft components: lysenin, a sphingomyelin- binding protein and the fluorescein ester of poly(ethyleneglycol)cholesteryl ether that labels cholesterol-rich domains. Sphingomyelin-rich domains that are spatially and functionally distinct from the GM1 ganglioside-rich domains were found at the plasma membrane of Jurkat T cells. In addition, the dynamics of cholesterol-rich domains could be monitored at the cell surface as well as inside the cells.",
