    "abstract_text": "Myeloid elf-1-like factor (MEF) or Elf4, which is a member of the ETS transcription factor family, up-regulates the basal expression of lysozyme gene in epithelial cells and is constitutively localized in the nucleus. The mammalian cell nucleus is organized into distinct nuclear domains or compartments that are essential for diverse physiological processes. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body or nuclear domain 10 is one of the nuclear domains and is involved in tumor suppression and regulation of transcription. Here, we investigate the role of PML nuclear body in MEF transactivation. We show that PML, but not Sp100, induced the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies and that MEF and PML physically interacted. This interaction stimulated MEF transcriptional activity, resulting in the up-regulation of endogenous lysozyme expression. Amino acids 348-517 of MEF were required for the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies and up-regulation of lysozyme transcription, which is enhanced by PML. Moreover, the C-terminal region of MEF spanning amino acids 477-517 was the putative region required for interaction between MEF and PML as determined with the use of the mammalian two-hybrid system. In addition, heat-shock treatment induced the accumulation of MEF in endogenous PML nuclear bodies and enhanced MEF transactivation of lysozyme gene. Thus, the recruitment of MEF to PML nuclear bodies may partly regulate lysozyme transcription in epithelial cells.",
