  "abstract_text": "As MHC genes are potent determinants of susceptibility to immunopathological diseases, the mapping of SAPK2a (CSBP) and SAPK4 to chromosome 6p 21.2-21.3 suggested that these genes may mediate the effects of the MHC on disease. Here we describe the genomic structure and localisation of both genes approximately 2.3Mb centromeric of HLA-DP. Examination of the complete coding region and selected intronic regions of SAPK2a and SAPK4 from 22 human EBV-transformed B-cell lines of different MHC haplotypes and racial background revealed complete sequence conservation. There were no notable differences in levels of expression of SAPK2a and SAPK4 mRNA in cell lines of different MHC haplotypes or racial origin. Examination of the SAPK2a and SAPK4 sequences from two chimpanzees revealed 3 nucleotide differences between human and chimpanzee in each gene resulting in only one amino acid change in SAPK4, and 6 nucleotide substitutions plus 2 deletions in 600bp of intronic sequence from SAPK4. This highlights the selective pressure placed on these genes to maintain their protein sequence, but does not favour a role in genetic regulation of disease or provide evidence of linkage disequilibrium with the MHC.",
