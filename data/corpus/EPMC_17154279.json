    "abstract_text": "In a new cohort of 141 unrelated patients affected by Kallmann syndrome we identified FGFR1 sequence variants in 17 patients, all in the heterozygous state. The fifteen novel variants consist of 10 missense (p.N77K, p.C101F, p.R250W, p.G270D, p.P283R, p.S332C, p.H621R, p.S685F, p.I693F, p.R822C), two nonsense (p.E324X, p.R661X), a frameshift (p.S439fs), and two splice site (c.1081G>C and c.1977+1G>A) changes. However, the p.N77K and p.R822C changes were also found in two and one out of 150 healthy control individuals, respectively, and therefore, their pathogenic effect is questionable. Notably, three alterations (p.E324X, p.S332C, c.1081G>C) are located in the alternative exon 8B that codes for the FGFR1c isoform, thus indicating that this isoform plays a crucial role in the development of the olfactory system in man. Moreover, the presence of cleft palate in a patient carrying the p.E324X change shows that FGFR1c is important for palate morphogenesis too.",
