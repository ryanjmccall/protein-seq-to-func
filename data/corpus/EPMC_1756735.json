    "abstract_text": "The retinoblastoma gene product (pRB) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is thought to play a key role in the negative regulation of cellular proliferation. pRB is phosphorylated in a cell cycle dependent manner, and studies in both actively dividing and differentiated cells suggest that this modification may be essential for cells to progress through the cell cycle. Using tryptic phosphopeptide mapping we have shown that pRB is phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues in vivo and that many of these phosphorylation events can be mimicked in vitro using purified p34cdc2. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to potential cdc2 phosphorylation sites, we have developed a strategy which has allowed the identification of five sites. S249, T252, T373, S807 and S811 are phosphorylated in vivo, and in each case these sites correspond closely to the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by p34cdc2. This and the observation that pRB forms a specific complex with p34cdc2 in vivo suggests that p34cdc2 or a p34cdc2-related protein is a major pRB kinase.",
