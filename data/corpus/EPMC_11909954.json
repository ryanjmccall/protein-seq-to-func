  "abstract_text": "The transcriptional coactivator p300 regulates transcription by binding to proteins involved in transcription and by acetylating histones and other proteins. These transcriptional effects are mainly at promoter and enhancer elements. Regulation of transcription also occurs through scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs), the chromatin regions that bind the nuclear matrix. Here we show that p300 binds to the S/MAR binding protein scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), a major constituent of the nuclear matrix. Using chromatin immunoprecipitations, we established that both p300 and SAF-A bind to S/MAR elements in the transiently silent topoisomerase I gene prior to its activation at G(1) during cell cycle. This binding is accompanied by local acetylation of nucleosomes, suggesting that p300-SAF-A interactions at S/MAR elements of nontranscribed genes might poise these genes for transcription.",
