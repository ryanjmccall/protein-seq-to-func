  "abstract_text": "We present here the complete primary structure of human gp330, the human variant of the principal kidney autoantigen causing Heymann membranous glomerulonephritis in rats. The deduced 4655 amino acid residues give a calculated molecular mass of 519636 Da for the mature protein and consists of a probable 25-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide sequence, an extracellular region of 4398 amino acids, a single transmembrane-spanning domain of 23 amino acids, and an intracellular C-terminal region of 209 amino acid residues. Three types of cysteine-rich repeats characteristic of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) superfamily are present in human gp330. In the extracellular region, there are a total of 36 LDLR ligand-binding repeats, comprising four distinct domains, 16 growth factor repeats separated by eight YWTD spacer regions, and one epidermal growth factor-like repeat. No consensus cleavage sequence for the processing endoprotease furin is detected in human gp330. The intracellular tail contains not only two copies of the F(X)NPXY coated-pit mediated internalization signal characteristic of LDLR superfamily members, but also intriguing and potentially functional motifs including several Src-homology 3 recognition motifs, one Src-homology 2 recognition motif for the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and additional sites for protein kinase C, casein kinase II and cAMP-/cGMP-dependent protein kinase. There is approximately 77% amino acid identity between human and rat gp330 with minor differences between the extracellular and intracellular regions. Recently gp330 has been implicated in Ca2+ regulation in the parathyroid, the placenta, and the renal tubule, but its overall physiological and pathological role still remains uncertain.",
