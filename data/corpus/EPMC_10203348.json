  "abstract_text": "A coding substitution (I93M) in the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal L1 (UCH-L1) gene has recently been identified in a German family with Parkinson's disease. We have sequenced the entire coding region of the gene in 11 families who have a pattern of disease consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. We found a polymorphism (S18Y) in exon 3, two polymorphisms in the 5' non-coding region, upstream of the transcription start, and an insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 4. The S18Y allele is present on approximately 20% of chromosomes in a Caucasian population. These changes are, therefore, unlikely to be pathogenic. We conclude that the I93M variant must either be a rare cause of disease or a harmless substitution whose occurrence in the family reflects a chance co-occurrence.",
