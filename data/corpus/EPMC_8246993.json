    "abstract_text": "The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) transduces signals important for the proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells. To identify functionally important regions in the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF-R, we compared the actions of the wild-type receptor, two mutants, and a natural splice variant in transfectants of the mouse pro-B cell line BAF3 and two myeloid cell lines, 32D and L-GM. A region of 55 amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane domain was found to be sufficient for generating a growth signal. The immediate downstream sequence of 30 amino acids substantially enhanced the growth signaling in the three cell lines. In contrast, the carboxy-terminal part of 98 amino acids strongly inhibited growth signaling in the two myeloid cell lines but not in BAF3 cells. Truncation of this region lead to an inability of the G-CSF-R to transduce maturation signals in L-GM cells. An alternative carboxy tail present in a splice variant of the G-CSF-R also inhibited growth signaling, notably in both the myeloid cells and BAF3 cells, but appeared not to be involved in maturation.",
