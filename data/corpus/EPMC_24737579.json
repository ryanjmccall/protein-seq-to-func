    "abstract_text": "46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD) are caused by disorders of gonadal development, androgen biosynthesis and receptor (AR) defects. Although, clinical/biochemical features help in distinguishing specific aetiologies, there are overlaps which necessitate molecular analyses for the definitive diagnosis. To test precision of our clinical diagnosis of androgen insensitivity (AIS) by analysing AR and then SRD5A2 genes, patients were recruited at Marmara University Hospital and molecular analyses were performed at Vall d'Hebron Research Institute. Among 101 46,XY DSD patients, 46 index and five siblings (nine complete, 42 partial) with clinical/biochemical data suggestive of AIS and stimulated T/DHT ratio <25 were selected. AR and then SRD5A2 genes were sequenced. We detected AR mutations in 11 patients [seven index and four siblings (22% of all and 15% of index patients)] and SRD5A2 mutations in six [five index and one sibling (12% of all and 11% of index)]. AR mutation detection rate was 6/9 in all CAIS and 4/7 in the index (67 and 57% respectively) and 5/42 in all PAIS and 3/40 in the index (12 and 7.5% respectively). The eight mutations detected in the AR gene were as follows: p.Q58L, p.P392S, p.R609K, p.R775H, p.R856H, p.A871A, p.V890M and p.F892L, with p.A871A and p.F892L being novel. Further six patients had SRD5A2 mutations which were as follows: p.L73WfsX59, p.Y91H, p.R171S and p.G196S, the first being novel. Hormonal data in those with AR mutations, SRD5A2 mutations and no mutations were not statistically different. In conclusion, a significant proportion of children with presumptive diagnosis of AIS has a normal AR gene. The less severe the phenotype, the less likely is the chance of demonstrating a mutation. Furthermore, a significant number of children with presumptive diagnosis of AIS have mutations in SRD5A2 gene and are clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from AIS.",
