  "title": "Isolation and mapping of a human gene (RPD3L1) that is homologous to RPD3, a transcription factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

  "abstract_text": "We have isolated a novel human gene RPD3L1, that is highly homologous to a transcription factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RPD3 (reduced potassium dependency 3), from a human fetal lung cDNA library. The cDNA clone, hRPD3, consists of 2,100 nucleotides that contain an open reading frame of 1446 nucleotides encoding 482 amino acids. It shares 62% identity in nucleotide sequence and 52% identity in amino acid sequence to RPD3. This gene is expressed at various levels in all tissues examined. Furthermore, we were able to map it to chromosome band 1p34.1 by FISH.",
