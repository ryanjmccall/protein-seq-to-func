    "abstract_text": "Pyrrolidine, pyrrolidinone, carbocyclic, and acyclic groups were used as isosteric proline replacements in a series of insulin-like growth factor I receptor kinase/insulin receptor kinase inhibitors. Examples that were similar in potency to proline-containing reference compounds were shown to project a key fluoropyridine amide into a common space, while less potent compounds were not able to do so for reasons of stereochemistry or structural rigidity.",
