It recognizes and binds to its substrates via the conserved Cdc4\u2010phosphodegron (CPD) motif (T/S\u2010P\u2010X\u2010X\u2010S/T/ D/E). 7 FBXW7 targets multiple oncoproteins for ubiquitination and degradation, including cyclin E, 8 c\u2010Myc, 9 c\u2010Jun, 10 Notch\u20101, 11 and SREBP1. 12 Silencing of FBXW7 expression was found to render metabolic advantages in pancreatic cancer cells through the induction of aerobic glycolysis by downregulating the thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in a c\u2010Myc\u2010dependent manner. 13 , 14 , 15 Previous studies have demonstrated that decreased FBXW7 expression induces cancer antigen 125 (CA125) or Muc16 production in pancreatic cancer cells, which are both regarded as metastatic markers of pancreatic cancer cells. 16 , 17 , 18 In this study, we present data highlighting a crucial role of MLST8 towards tumor progression. We validate that FBXW7 physically interacts with MLST8 and mediates its ubiquitylation, which highlights potential future efforts towards developing therapeutic strategies against renal cancer (ccRCC). 2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 2.1 Cell culture and transfection 786\u2010O, A498, and 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). 786\u2010O cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, and incubated in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C. A498 and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. All transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the contribution of cyclin B\u2010CDK1, cells were treated with a CDK inhibitor, such as butyrolactone I 18 , 19 or RO\u20103306 (Calbiochem). 2.2 Expression constructs Human cDNAs for c\u2010Myc, Fbxw7, and MLST8 were amplified from the human brain cDNA library (Clontech) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These cDNAs were inserted into the EcoR I and Not I restriction sites of pCMV\u2010HA vector, pCMV\u2010FLAG vector, and pCMV\u2010Myc. PCR amplified cDNAs for the phosphorylation site mutants of the mouse (T50A/S54A) and human (T50A) with primers corresponding to the mutant sequences and inserted into Eco RI/ BamH I sites of pCMV\u2010HA vector to generate pCMV\u2010HA\u2010c\u2010Myc (T50A/S54A) and pCMV\u2010HA\u2010c\u2010Myc (T50A), respectively. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. 2.3 Establish stable Cas\u20109 knockout and overexpression 786\u2010O and A498 cell lines The FBXW7 and MLST8 Cas\u20109 gene knockout plasmid was constructed using the Lenti CRISPR V2 plasmid, then transfected with psPAX2 and pCMV\u2010VSV\u2010G plasmid at a ratio of 4:3:3 into 293 T cells. 786\u2010O cells in a 60 mm dish were infected with 1 mL of virus supernatant when the cell density was 60%\u201080%. The positive cells were screened with puromycin for 2 weeks. The result was verified by Western blotting. The method is the same as the above: 10 \u03bcg of pCDH\u2010CD513B\u2010Flag\u2010FBXW7 plasmid and 10 \u03bcg of pCDH\u2010CD513B\u2010Myc\u2010MLST8 plasmid, respectively, and 10 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 were transfected into 786\u2010O and A498 cells, then screened with puromycin for 2 weeks. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1 .

Anti\u2010human MLST8 phosphorylated Thr50 polyclonal antibody (anti\u2010p\u2010T50\u2010MLST8) was raised against keyhole limpet hemocyanin\u2010conjugated chemically synthesized phosphorylated Thr50 peptide, corresponding to the CPD region of MLST8 (amino acid residues 50\u201061) (MBL). Antiserum obtained from an immunized guinea pig was bound to column chromatography conjugated with P\u2010T50 peptide. The affinity\u2010purified anti\u2010p\u2010T50\u2010MLST8 was then passed through a column conjugated to nonphosphorylated Thr50 peptide (amino acid residues 50\u201061 of MLST8) to deplete antibodies against the nonphosphorylated antigen. ELISA confirmed the specific binding ability of the purified antibody to P\u2010T50 peptide. 2.5 Immunoprecipitation To immunoprecipitate the ectopically expressed Flag\u2010tagged proteins, transfected cells were lysed 24 h post\u2010transfection in BC100 buffer. The whole\u2010cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti\u2010Flag antibody\u2010conjugated M2 agarose beads (Sigma) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After three washes with Flag lysis buffer, followed by two washes with BC100 buffer, the bound proteins were eluted using Flag\u2010Peptide (Sigma)/BC100 for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. SDS\u2010PAGE resolved the eluted mate\u00adrial. To immunoprecipitate the endogenous proteins, cells were lysed with 1\u00d7 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) and the lysate was centrifuged. The supernatant was precleared with protein A/G beads (Sigma) and incubated with indicated antibodies overnight. After that, protein A/G beads were applied, all at 4\u00b0C. After 2 h of incubation, pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer and resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS\u2010PAGE. 2.6 Western blot Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS\u2010PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked in Tris\u2010buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween\u201020, washed twice in TBS containing 0.1% Tween\u201020, and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h followed by secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins of interest were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence system (Santa Cruz). In vitro, phosphorylation was performed as described previously. 20 , 21 , 22 2.7 Quantitative RT\u2010PCR Total RNA was isolated from transiently transfected cells using TRIzol reagent (Tiangen), and cDNA was reversed\u2010transcribed using a Superscript RT kit (TOYOBO), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was performed using a SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (TOYOBO). All quantization was normalized to the level of endogenous control GAPDH. The primer sequences are listed in Table 2 .

Cell migration was assessed using a 24\u2010well transwell unit with polycarbonate membrane (pore size 8 \u03bcm) (Corning) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was coated with Matrigel basement membrane matrix (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL) (BD Bioscience) for 24 h. Cells (0.5\u20102.5 \u00d7 104) were then seeded into the upper chamber in a serum\u2010free medium. The lower chamber was filled with a medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h of incubation, the cells in the upper chamber were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet for 20 min. For invasion, the membranes utilized were Matrigel\u2010coated invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) that were prehydrated in a serum\u2010free medium. 2.9 Immunohistochemistry Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were made using the above 79 paired tissues in Shanghai Outdo Biotech Company (Shanghai, China), including tumor and adjacent normal tissues. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed by the streptavidin\u2010peroxidase method (Zymed Laboratories Inc). IHC scores were determined by the estimated proportion of positive tumor cells in percentage. To assess the average degree of staining within a tumor, multiple regions were analyzed and at least 100 tumor cells were assessed. The H\u2010score system assessed the cytoplasmic or nucleus expression. The H\u2010score formula is Histoscore = \u2211( I \u00d7 Pi ), where I is the intensity of staining and Pi is the percentage of stained tumor cells, producing a cytoplasmic score ranging from 0 to 200. The scoring was independently assessed by two assessors (AWHC and JHMT) who were unaware of the clinical outcomes. 2.10 In vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis assay Cells stably knockout MLST8 (2 \u00d7 106) or control cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flanks of 5 BALB/c (nu/nu) mice. Tumor size was measured weekly using a caliper. After 4 weeks, the mice were sacrificed for tumor burden analysis. The tumor volume was calculated as volume = (length \u00d7 width 2 )/2. For intrahepatic metastasis assays, cells (3 \u00d7 106/mouse) were injected into the livers of nude mice. Tumor nodules formed on the liver surfaces were macroscopically determined and counted. The livers were excised and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 \u03bcm) were stained with H&E to visualize the structure. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is from Ethics Committee of General Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 2.11 Statistical analysis Data were expressed as means \u00b1 SD. All experiments were carried out with three or more replicates. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t \u2010test for most studies using GraphPad Prism v7.0 software. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Elevated expression of MLST8 in human renal cancer We initially evaluated the expression of MLST8 mRNA in ccRCC from the cancer\u2010related databases GEPIA ( http://gepia.cancer\u2010pku.cn/ ) and Oncomine ( www.oncomine.org/ ). According to GEPIA database results, MLST8 is generally overexpressed in renal carcinoma (red) and downregulated in normal tissue (green) (Figure 1A\u2010B ). We further explored the Oncomine database and collected the number of statistically significant datasets with MLST8 mRNA overexpression (red) or downregulation (blue) in Figure 1C . The expression level of MLST8 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues in the Oncomine dataset (Jones Renal [Figure 1D ], Cutcliffe Renal [Figure 1E [). FIGURE 1 Analysis of MLST8 RNA expression on GEPIA and Oncomine database. A, MLST8 RNA expression in different cancers on GEPIA. B, Median TPM of MLST8 in different cancers on GEPIA. C, MLST8 RNA expression in different cancers on Oncomine database. D\u2010G, Exhibition of MLST8 expression (cancer vs normal) of other kidney cancers and ccRCC tissue in the Oncomine datasets 3.2 MLST8 is a potential biomarker for ccRCC according to TCGA As shown in Figure 2A , MLST8 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC samples compared to normal tissues at the transcriptional level ( P < .0001). We evaluated this association with clinical\u2010pathological characteristics. Although there was no difference between MLST8 expression and lymphatic metastasis, MLST8 was correlated to tumor stage M (Figure 2B\u2010E ). Because the N1 stage samples from TCGA were small, this was insufficient to demonstrate a correlation between MLST8 and N metastasis. However, a strong correlation was identified between the MLST8 expression and the overall survival (OS) of ccRCC patients (Figure 2F , P = .0248). Therefore, we assumed that the nonsignificance between MLST8 and distant metastasis was potentially due to the limited sample size, necessitating future validation. FIGURE 2 MLST8 is a potential biomarker for ccRCC according to TCGA. A, Expression level of MLST8 in ccRCC was elevated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. B, Expression of MLST8 was elevated gradually as ccRCC progressed to stage II and stage III. C, Expression of MLST8 presented as more upregulated in stages T2 and T3 compared to T1. D, Expression of MLST8 in ccRCC patients with stage M1 was remarkedly increased compared that in stage M0. E, There was no significant difference of MLST8 expression between stages N1 and N0 in ccRCC patients. F, OS curve of ccRCC patients based on MLST8 expression ( P = .0248) 3.3 MLST8 is upregulated in ccRCC specimens and predicts poor clinical outcomes in ccRCC patients Overexpressed MLST8 protein was found in ccRCC specimens compared to adjacent normal tissue (Table 3 , P < .0001), and the results showed a significant increase in the expression levels of MLST8 as ccRCC progressed to an advanced stage (Figure 3A,B ). The association between MLST8 expression and clinical pathological characteristics is shown in Table 3 . The overexpression of MLST8 was strikingly correlated to the T stage ( P = .009) and Furman grade (Figure 3D , P < .0001). However, there was no association between MLST8 expression levels and a patient's age, gender, and size. We developed Kaplan\u2010Meier curves on 75 patients with a log\u2010rank test for OS to elucidate the relationship between MLST8 expression and patient survival in ccRCC. Our results reveal that a high expression of MLST8 is associated with poor OS (Figure 3E , P = .0183). These results suggest that MLST8 is a potential prognostic marker in ccRCC.

E, OS curve of ccRCC patients based on MLST8 expression according to Kaplan\u2010Meier analysis. Patients with high levels of MLST8 were associated with poor survival ( P = .0183) 3.4 Downexpression of MLST8 inhibits ccRCC proliferation and metastasis To confirm the clinical significance of MLST8, we were prompted to determine its biological role in the progression of ccRCC. We therefore performed a subcutaneous tumor formation test, and the results showed that MLST8 knockout could impair tumor formation in vivo (Figure 4A ), suggesting that MLST8 promotes the proliferation and growth of ccRCC cells in vivo (Figure 4C\u2010D ). Immunohistochemical analysis also showed that MLST8 expression was positively correlated with Ki67 expression, which is a recognized marker of cell proliferation (Figure 4B ). According to the biological role of MLST8 mentioned above, further proof is necessary to demonstrate the in vivo role of MLST8 overexpression on metastasis. MLST8\u2010knocking out or empty vector\u2010transfected cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to mimic cell liver metastasis. Fewer liver metastatic nodules were observed in mice injected with MLST8\u2010knocking out cells compared with mice injected with control cells (Figure 4E ). Histopathological studies confirmed that the liver disease was caused by ccRCC cell invasion and subsequent tumor growth (Figure 4F ). We therefore conclude that MLST8 knockout inhibits renal cancer growth and metastasis. FIGURE 4 Downexpression of MLST8 inhibits ccRCC metastasis.

All assays were conducted in triplicate 3.5 FBXW7 interacts with MLST8 A previous study performed quantitative mass spectrometry on FBXW7 knockout (KO) HCT116 cells. 23 Enrichment of MLST8 protein in the nuclear fraction of the HCT116 FBXW7\u2010KO cells could be a binding partner for FBXW7 and, most likely, the alpha isoform that resides in the nucleus (Figure 5A ). To verify that FBXW7 is a bona fide MLST8 interactor, we first examined whether FBXW7 can interact with MLST8 cells. FLAG\u2010FBXW7 and Myc\u2010MLST8 constructs were co\u2010expressed in 293T cells. Cells were subsequently harvested for co\u2010immunoprecipitation (Co\u2010IP) with the anti\u2010FLAG antibody. As shown in Figure 5B , Myc\u2010MLST8 was immunoprecipitated by FLAG\u2010FBXW7, suggesting an exogenous interaction between these two proteins. In addition, a reciprocal Co\u2010IP assay was performed using lysates of 293T cells that were co\u2010transfected with FLAG\u2010MLST8 and Myc\u2010FBXW7 constructs. The results indicate that FLAG\u2010MLST8 is also able to immuneprecipitate Myc\u2010FBXW7 (Figure 5C ). Further experiments showed that FLAG\u2010FBXW7 is capable of immunoprecipitating endogenous MLST8 in 786\u2010O cells (Figure 5D ). FIGURE 5 FBXW7 directly interacts with MLST8. A, Quantitative mass spectrometry using FBXW7 knockout (KO) HCT116 cells. B and C, 293T cells were co\u2010transfected with Myc\u2010MLST8 and FLAG\u2010FBXW7 constructs.

G, Confocal microscopy of 786\u2010O cells stained with MLST8 and FBXW7 antibodies. DAPI represents nuclear staining. Red, green, and blue channel images were captured by Olympus. Maximum projection images are shown, original magnification \u00d740 Immunoprecipitation using the anti\u2010MLST8 antibody was performed using cell lysates prepared from 786\u2010O cells. As shown in Figure 5E , endogenous FBXW7 was immunoprecipitated by MLST8, suggesting an endogenous interaction between these two proteins. Similarly, endogenous MLST8 was immunoprecipitated by FBXW7 (Figure 5F ). To further confirm the endogenous interaction between MLST8 and FBXW7, we tested whether these two proteins are co\u2010localized to the same subcellular compartments. 786\u2010O Cells were immunostained with FBXW7 or MLST8 antibodies and observed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 5G , FBXW7 and MLST8 were co\u2010located in the cell nucleus. Taken together, these results indicated that FBXW7 is associated with MLST8 in 786\u2010O cells. 3.6 MLST8 is degraded and ubiquitinated by tumor suppressor FBXW7 Myc\u2010FBXW7\u03b1 and Flag\u2010MLST8 were co\u2010transfected in 293T cells, followed by treatment with DMSO and MG132, respectively. Although Myc\u2010FBXW7\u03b1 promoted the degradation of MLST8, this effect was inhibited by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 6A ). According to previous reports, FBXW7, as the adaptor protein of the substrate, can interact with Cullin1 and RBX1 to form a ubiquitination complex, so whether Cullin1 or other members of the Culling family, for example CUL1, CUL2, CUL4A, CUL4B, and CUL5 are also involved in FBXW7's regulation of MLST8 protein stability. We therefore eliminated endogenous Culling 1, Culling 2, Culling 3, Culling 4A, Culling 4B, Culling 5, and RBX1 elements in the complex in 786\u2010O cells by transient transfection of siRNA. The change in MLST8 protein expression was detected by WB experiment. Interestingly, the results showed that, compared with the blank control group, the expression level of MLS8 protein was obviously increased except after CUL1 and RBX1 elimination, while the expression level of MLST8 protein was not changed by culling family protein elimination (Figure 6B ). Similarly, we detected the expression changes of MLST8 protein after overexpressing Culling family negative effector mutants in 786\u2010O cells, and the results were consistent with the previous results. Only the overexpressing RBX1 and Cul1 negative effector mutants led to significant downregulation of MLST8 protein expression. This allowed us to determine that Cul1 specifically mediates degradation of MLST8 ubiquitin proteasome pathways in the Culling family (Figure 6C ). Therefore, we conclude that Cul1 and RBX1 elements are essential for FBXW7 ubiquitination of MLST8, while other Culling family members do not appear to influence MLST8. FIGURE 6 MLST8 is degraded and ubiquitination by tumor suppressor FBXW7. A, Western blotting analysis of WCLs of 293T cells transfected with the indicated constructs. B, The expressions of Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, Cul4B, Cul5, and RBX1 were reduced by transient transfection siRNA in 786\u2010O cells.

H, 786\u2010O cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h, followed by Western blotting analysis. I, 786\u2010O cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h, followed by Western blotting analysis. J, Western blot of indicated proteins in WCLs from 786\u2010O with FBXW7 knockout through CRISPR/Cas9 methods, followed by treatment with 20 \u03bcM MG132 for 8 h. K, 786\u2010O cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 16 h, followed by treatment with 20 \u03bcM MG132 for 8 h We used CRISPR\u2010Cas9 to knockout endogenous copies of FBXW7 in 786\u2010O and A498 cells with two FBXW7\u2010specific sgRNAs, resulting in an increase in MLST8 protein levels (Figure 6D ) but no effect on the mRNA expression (Figure 6E ). Further results showed that the depletion of FBXW7 significantly extends the half\u2010life of endogenous MLST8 protein and stabilizes the levels of MLST8 protein (Figure 6F,G ). Furthermore, when 786\u2010O cells were transfected with three isoforms (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) of FBXW7, this resulted in a marked reduction in the protein levels of MLST8 in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Figure 6H ). Since FBXW7 is an ubiquitinating enzyme, we wondered whether FBXW7 can ubiquitinate and downregulate MLST8 protein levels. As shown in Figure 6I , ectopic expression of FBXW7\u2010WT, but not the FBXW7\u2010\u25b3F\u2010box mutant (catalytic inactive), decreased the protein levels of co\u2010expressed MLST8 in a dose\u2010dependent manner, suggesting that the ubiquitination activity of FBXW7 promotes MLST8 destabilization. Conversely, the depletion of FBXW7 using CRISPR\u2010Cas9 knockout decreased MLST8 ubiquitination levels (Figure 6J ), indicating that FBXW7 is responsible for MLST8 ubiquitination. Additionally, MLST8 protein was robustly polyubiquitinated in a dose\u2010dependent manner when FBXW7\u2010WT was co\u2010expressed. By contrast, minimal or no MLST8 polyubiquitination was observed in FBXW7\u2010\u25b3F\u2010box expressing cells (Figure 6K ). In summary, these data demonstrate that the FBXW7 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex regulates MLST8 protein stability through the ubiquitin\u2010dependent proteasomal degradation pathway in ccRCC cell lines. 3.7 Mutants of FBXW7 are defective in promoting MLST8 degradation and ubiquitination In the TCGA database, we did not find the high\u2010frequency mutation of FBXW7 in ccRCC, but did find it in pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. We therefore selected the high\u2010frequency mutation sites of FBXW7, including R505C, W406A, T416A, L443F, W425R, S462P, H468R, D510E, and D527G, in other cancers to clarify the relationship between MLST8 and protein levels and inactive mutations of FBXW7 (Figure 7A ). To test this, nine Myc\u2010tagged mutants of FBXW7 were generated: R505C, W406A, T416A, L443F, W425R, S462P, H468R, D510E, and D527G. We initially examined their interactions with MLST8 by co\u2010IP assay. The results showed that mutations of the residues at the corresponding domains substantially decreased the capacity of FBXW7 to interact with MLST8 in vivo, suggesting that FBXW7 mutants are defective in binding to MLST8 (Figure 7B ). We then investigated the half\u2010life of additional targets of FBXW7 in cells transfected with wild type or W425R FBXW7 mutant. Thirty\u2010six hours following transfection cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) to prevent de novo protein synthesis. Western blot analyses confirmed an extended half\u2010life and reduced turnover of MLST8 in cells carrying W425R (Figure 7C ). FBXW7 wild type, the FBXW7 R505C reportedly dead\u2010mutant, and additional FBXW7 mutants (S462P, H468R, D510E, D527G, W605R, T416A, W425R, and L443F) previously isolated from 786\u2010O cells were transiently transfected along with tagged\u2010expression vectors for MLST8. The ability of transfected FBXW7 and mutants to degrade targets wase assessed by Western blot analyses, As expected, wild\u2010type FBXW7 was able to induce degradation of MLST8 while R505C was not. Additional FBXW7 mutants (L443F, W425R, S462P, and H468R) present a phenotype similar to that of R505C and could not induce degradation of any targets (Figure 7D ). Furthermore, in vivo ubiquitination assays indicated that some FBXW7 mutants (R505C, L443F, W425R, S462P, and H468R) lost the ability to promote MLST8 polyubiquitination compared to wild\u2010type FBXW7 (Figure 7E\u2010F ). Taken together, our findings suggest that mutants of FBXW7 are defective in promoting MLST8 degradation and ubiquitination. FIGURE 7 Mutants of FBXW7 are defective in promoting MLST8 degradation and ubiquitination. A, Distribution of the point mutations on the FBXW7 gene found in TCGA pan\u2010cancer samples. B, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. After 24 h, cell lysates were prepared for co\u2010IP assay with anti\u2010FLAG antibody and WB analyzes. C, FBXW7 W425R increased the half\u2010life of MLST. The effect of FBXW7 on the half\u2010life of oncoproteins was determined by Western blot after cells treated with 100 \u03bcg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) for 0, 2, 4, and 6 h. D, 293T cells were transfected with wild\u2010type or mutated FBXW7 constructs as indicated. After 24 h, cell lysates were prepared for WB analysis. E, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. After 24 h, cells were treated with 20 \u03bcmol/L MG132 for 4 h and cell lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation and WB analysis. F, 293 T cells were cotransfected with indicated Myc\u2010 FBXW7, HA\u2010Ub, and Flag\u2010MLST8. Cells were treated with MG132 for 4 h before harvest. Immunoprecipitated FLAG and Western blot Ub showed the ubiquitination level of MLST8 3.8 Thr50\u2010dependence is required for FBXW7\u2010mediated degradation of MLST8 The FBXW7\u2010binding consensus motif (T/S)P XX (S/T/D/E) has been identified in several FBXW7 substrates, including cyclin E, c\u2010Myc, c\u2010 Jun, 9 , 10 and OASIS. 23 Interestingly, when we examined the amino acid sequence of MLST8, we discovered that MLST8 harbors one perfectly matched (50\u2010TPDRS\u201054) FBXW7\u2010binding motif (Figure 8A,B ). FBXW7 often recognizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues in the CPD motif. Therefore, we speculated that the regulation of MLST8 by FBXW7 might be mediated by the phosphorylation of Thr50 in its CPD. To examine whether this region is required for the FBXW7\u2010MLST8 interaction, we generated MLST8 mutants in which the acidic residues T50 and S54 were mutated to alanine. 293T cells were co\u2010transfected with FBXW7\u03b1 and MLST8\u2010WT or MLST8 mutant. Although FBXW7 coimmunoprecipitated MLST8\u2010WT at a similar level, both MLST8 mutants completely lost their FBXW7\u2010binding capability (Figure 8C ). These data indicate that the 50\u2010TPDRS\u201054 motif is necessary for the FBXW7\u2010MLST8 interaction. Next, we sought to identify whether the 50\u2010TPDRS\u201054 motif is required for the FBXW7\u2010mediated degradation of MLST8. As shown in Figure 8D , while FBXW7 efficiently targets MLST8\u2010WT for degradation, the MLST8\u2010T50A/S54A mutant displayed resistance to FBXW7\u2010mediated degradation, indicating that the 50\u2010TPDRS\u201054 motif is crucial to FBXW7\u2010mediated MLST8 degradation. Furthermore, the T50A/S54A mutation prolonged the half\u2010life of MLST8 protein (Figure 8E,F ). In vivo ubiquitination assays suggest that FBXW7 robustly enhances the polyubiquitination of MLST8\u2010WT, but not the MLST8\u2010T50A/S54A mutant (Figure 8G ). Consistent with the protein degradation, the T50A/S54A mutation largely diminished FBXW7\u2010induced MLST8 ubiquitination. These data therefore demonstrate that the 50\u2010TPDRS\u201054 motif functions as an MLST8 degron and is essential for FBXW7 binding and degradation through the ubiquitin\u2010proteasome pathway. FIGURE 8 Thr50\u2010dependent is required for FBXW7\u2010mediated degradation of MLST8.

D, 786\u2010O cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h, followed by Western blotting analysis. E and F, 786\u2010O cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 24 h, cells were treated with 50 \u03bcg/mL CHX. G, 786\u2010O cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 16 h, followed by treatment with 20 \u03bcm MG132 for 8 h 3.9 Activated CDK1 induces degradation of MLST8 and decreases binding with FBXW7 and MLST8 FBXW7\u2010mediated degradation requires the phosphorylation of the first Ser/Thr in the CPD motif of FBXW7 target proteins by a variety of kinases, including GSK3\u03b2, 24 CDK1/2, 22 CDK4, and CDK5. 25 To identify the kinase involved in the phosphorylation of T50 in MLST8, we first analyzed the surrounding amino acid sequence and found that Thr50 in MLST8 perfectly matches the general CDK1/2 consensus motif (S/TP X K/R). 26 WT\u2010MLST8 expressed in 293T cells treated with phosphatase and proteasome inhibitors was detected by an anti\u2010p\u2010T50\u2010MLST8 antibody, but this was not detected when using the T50A\u2010MLST8 mutant (Figure 9A ). Thus, the Thr50 of exogenous MLST8 is phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, we detected endogenous MLST8 and its phosphorylation on Thr50 in 786\u2010O cells transfected with MLST8 control (Figure 9B ), suggesting that endogenous MLST8 was phosphorylated at Thr50 in 786\u2010O cells. The CPD motif in MLST8 (Thr50\u2010Pro51\u2010Asp52\u2010Lys53\u2010Ser54) corresponds to the consensus motif for CDKs, which is Ser/Thr\u2010Pro\u2010 X \u2010Lys/Arg (Figure 9C ). To identify the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of MLST8 at residue Thr50, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay using purified GST\u2010MLST8 protein and recombinant cyclin\u2010CDK complexes. Phosphorylation of Thr50 in MLST8 by a variety of kinases, including CDK5, CDK4, and CDK2, was not detected, but phosphorylation on a control RB protein had the same efficiency (Figure 9D,E ). CDK1 efficiently phosphorylated MLST8 at Thr50, while CDK2 slightly resulted in phosphorylation (Figure 9D ). We also examined whether recombinant GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylates GST\u2010MLST8 in vitro (Figure 9F ). We determined that GSK3\u03b2 did not phosphorylate Thr50 in MLST8 in vitro and is not the kinase responsible for the CPD motif of MLST8. Furthermore, we investigated whether phosphorylation of Thr50 in MLST8 was required for its recognition by FBXW7 using a GST pull\u2010down assay. Purified GST\u2010WT\u2010MLST8 or GST\u2010T50A\u2010MLST8 was phosphorylated by CDK1 and incubated with cell lysates expressing FLAG\u2010FBXW7. MLST8 in the presence of CDK1 migrated more slowly than the unphosphorylated form of MLST8, even when Thr50 was mutated to alanine (T50A). We also found that FBXW7 bound to GST\u2010WT\u2010MLST8 was detected by an anti\u2010p\u2010T50\u2010MLST8 antibody after treatment with CDK1, but did not bind to GST\u2010MLST8 without CDK1 (Figure 9G ). Therefore, these results suggest that CDK1 phosphorylation of residue Thr50 in MLST8 is responsible for its recognition by FBXW7. FIGURE 9 Activated CDK1 induces degradation of MLST8 and decreases binding with FBXW7 and MLST8. A, Evaluation of antibodies against phospho\u2010Thr50\u2010MLST8 (p\u2010T50\u2010MLST8).

In contrast, the depletion of FBXW7 could significantly enhance cell proliferation, and the phenotypes could be rescued by MLST8 co\u2010depletion (Figure 10A,B ). We observed similar effects for the cell proliferation assay, in which the increase of migration and invasion in 786\u2010O and A498 cells by FBXW7 depletion was partly diminished by MLST8 inactivation (Figure 10C,D ). Thus, these results suggest that MLST8 is an essential mediator of FBXW7 inactivation\u2010induced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

Statistical analysis revealed that MLST8 was remarkably overexpressed in renal cancer tissues compared to normal tissue. In contrast, FBXW7 was expressed at a lower level in tumor tissues (Figure 11A ) . The clinical and pathologic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table. 2 . In the 79 paired ccRCC cases, MLST8 protein was greatly overexpressed in 60.0% of tumor tissues and FBXW7 was found to be underexpressed in 68.4% of tumor tissues (Figure 11B ) . Moreover, statistical analysis indicated that MLST8 was negatively correlated with FBXW7 expression in this cohort of patient samples ( r = \u2212.3124, P = .0051) (Figure 11C ) . Furthermore, the univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the independent prognostic factors for ccRCC patients (Table 4 ). In univariate analysis, the MLST8 expression level instead of FBXW7, was found to be significantly associated with the OS ( P = .006). TNM stage ( P < .0001) and Fuhrman grade ( P = .001) were also correlated significantly with OS, but other factors such as tumor size ( P = .058) and age ( P = .871) were uncorrelated significantly with OS. Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that the TNM stage ( P < .0001) and tumor size ( P = .050) were proven to be independent predictors of OS for ccRCC patients. Simultaneously, other variables, including age and Fuhrman grade, did not contribute to OS independently ( P > .05).

In recent years there have been multiple reports suggesting the role of MLST8 in malignancies, including colon and prostate cancer. Studies have shown that the overexpression of MLST8 suppresses tumor growth and invasion. 4 , 26 Another study showed that MLST8 contributes to promoting cell proliferation and metastasis via the AKT pathway in HCC. 14 We observed that MLST8 upregulation was associated with the upregulation of other components of mTOR complexes, such as mTOR itself and RICTOR/RAPTOR. Therefore, MLST8 upregulation can be attributed to enhanced protein stabilization, which is in turn caused by the upregulation of binding partners that are modulated by other mechanisms, such as micro\u2010RNA silencing. 28 Our study first detected MLST8 expression and analyzed its correlation with clinical factors in ccRCC patients. We identified that the overexpression of MLST8 was a frequent event in ccRCC specimens, which is in line with TCGA. We also confirmed that increased MLST8 expression is predictive of an unfavorable prognosis for human renal cancer. The cellular functions and molecular mechanisms of MLST8 remain unknown in ccRCC. Ubiquitin\u2010proteasome\u2010dependent protein degradation usually requires direct interaction between the substrate and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. 29 Fbw7 contains several conserved protein interaction domains. A stretch of eight WD40 repeats makes multiple contacts with the CPDs in the Fbw7 substrate. 29 Rapamycin binds to FK506 binding protein\u201012 (FKBP12) to form the FKBP12\u2010rapamycin complex, which only partially inhibits mTOR kinase activity. 30 A recent study implied that concurrent targeting of mTORC1/2 by OSI\u2010027 potently inhibits the proliferation and the migration of keloid keratinocytes. 31 Other studies have implied that the concurrent targeting of mTORC1/2 by OSI\u2010027 potently inhibits the proliferation and migration of keloid keratinocytes. 31 Due to these limitations, direct mTOR kinase inhibitors have been developed and termed \u201csecond\u2010generation mTOR inhibitors\u201d. 32 In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the WD40 domain of Fbw7 indeed binds to the CPD of MLST8. We note that the depletion of FBXW7 shows impaired binding to MLST8 proteins, resulting in impaired proteasomal degradation and the accumulation of MLST8 in renal cancer cell lines and cancer specimens, which partly contributes to FBXW7 inactivation\u2010induced renal cancer cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, the exact mechanism by which CDK1, excluding the possibility of other protein kinases, phosphorylates MLST8 has also been determined (Figure 11D ). As a shared subunit between mTORC1 and mTORC2, MLST8 may play a divergent role in the activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Genetic studies showed that the ablation of MLST8 in mice only influences mTORC2 function. 6 MLST8 protein inhibitors are emerging as promising anticancer therapies. The gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 was the most frequently mutated gene in 20 CCA patients. 6 FBXW7, W406R, and T416A are similar in activity to wild\u2010type FBXW7, while the mutants D510E and D527G degrade all targets except for NOTCH1. 33 Hotspot mutations in FBXW7 have been reported for R505, R465, and R479, and represent 25.41%, 9.29%, and 13.40%, respectively, of all FBXW7 mutations in cancer. 34 Mutations in FBXW7 that prevent BRAF degradation were associated with resistance to BET inhibitors. 35 FBXW7 mutant expression confers BET inhibitor resistance. In conclusion, our results show that the upregulation of MLST8 exerts a decisive role in ccRCC progression. MLST8 is an independent predictive indicator for OS and provides novel insights into the aberrant regulation of MLST8 in renal cancer, suggesting that MLST8 is an important mediator of FBXW7 inactivation\u2010induced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This understanding will contribute to the elucidation of new strategies in developing substrate\u2010specific FBXW7 inhibitors for therapeutic use.

    "full_text_abstract": "Abstract Recent studies have reported that MLST8 is upregulated in many malignant tumors. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this work was to investigate how MLST8 contributes to the development and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). MLST8 is an oncogenic protein in the TCGA database and ccRCC clinical specimens. We also ascertain that MLST8 interacts with FBXW7, which was universally regarded as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. MLST8 can be degraded and ubiquitinated by tumor suppressor FBXW7. FBXW7 recognizes a consensus motif (T/S) PXX (S/T/D/E) of MLST8 and triggers MLST8 degradation via the ubiquitin\u2010proteasome pathway. Strikingly, the activated cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) kinase engages in the MLST8 phosphorylation required for FBXW7\u2010mediated degradation. In vitro, we further prove that MLST8 is an essential mediator of FBXW7 inactivation\u2010induced tumor growth, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the MLST8 and FBXW7 proteins are negatively correlated in human renal cancer specimens. Our findings suggest that MLST8 is a putative oncogene that functions via interaction with FBXW7, and inhibition MLST8 could be a potential future target in ccRCC treatment.\n\nSchematic diagram of the CDK1\u2010FBXW7\u03b1 signaling axis in the regulation of MLST8 protein degradation."
