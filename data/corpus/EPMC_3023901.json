  "abstract_text": "We present the nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the rat c-rasH-1 gene and a partial sequence analysis of the rat c-rasH-2 gene. By comparing these sequences with the Harvey murine sarcoma virus ras gene, we predict that the p21 protein encoded by the Harvey virus differs from the cellular c-rasH-1-encoded p21 at only two amino acids; those at positions 12 and 59. Alterations at each of these positions may play a role in activating the viral p21 protein. The c-rasH-2 gene is likely to be a nonfunctional pseudogene because it lacks introns, cannot be activated to transform NIH 3T3 cells, and differs in sequence from both c-rasH-1 and v-rasH at several base pair positions.",
