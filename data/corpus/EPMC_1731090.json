    "abstract_text": "We examined cellular components which associate with p40tax, the viral transactivation molecule of human T-cell leukemia virus type I. Such molecules were searched by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for p40tax. Two cellular proteins with molecular masses of 95 kDa (p95) and 60 kDa (p60) were specifically coprecipitated with p40tax from extracts of all p40tax-producing cell lines but not from p40tax-negative cell lines. The p60 component was also shown to associate with p40tax in vitro, by using radiolabel-chase experiments. Rabbit antisera specific for p60 and p95 were prepared by immunization with electrophoretically purified molecules. While anti-p95 antiserum coprecipitated p40tax, no p40tax could be identified in immunoprecipitates by using a polyclonal anti-p60 antiserum. The partial amino acid sequence of p60 demonstrated that p60 is identical to the human 60-kDa heat shock protein (a member of the chaperonin family of proteins). Although the biological significance of the complex formation of p40tax with p95 and p60 has yet to be determined, it may be that the complex formation is one of the mechanisms by which the biological activity of p40tax can be regulated.",
