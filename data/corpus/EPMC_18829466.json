    "abstract_text": "Aging is one major risk factor for numerous diseases. The enzyme telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays an important role for aging and apoptosis. Previously, we demonstrated that inhibition of oxidative stress-induced Src kinase family-dependent nuclear export of TERT results in delayed replicative senescence and reduced apoptosis sensitivity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms inhibiting nuclear export of TERT. First, we demonstrated that H2O2-induced nuclear export of TERT was abolished in Src, Fyn, and Yes-deficient embryonic fibroblasts. Next, we wanted to identify one potential negative regulator of this export process. One candidate is the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 (Shp-2), which can counteract activities of the Src kinase family. Indeed, Shp-2 was evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytosol. Nuclear Shp-2 associates with TERT in endothelial cells and dissociates from TERT prior to its nuclear export. Overexpression of Shp-2 wt inhibited H2O2-induced export of TERT. Overexpression of the catalytically inactive, dominant negative Shp-2 mutant (Shp-2(C459S)) reduced endogenous as well as overexpressed nuclear TERT protein and telomerase activity, whereas it had no influence on TERT(Y707F). Binding of TERT(Y707F) to Shp-2 is reduced compared with TERTwt. Ablation of Shp-2 expression led only to an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of TERTwt, but not of TERT(Y707F). Moreover, reduced Shp-2 expression decreased nuclear telomerase activity, whereas nuclear telomerase activity was increased in Shp-2-overexpressing endothelial cells. In conclusion, Shp-2 retains TERT in the nucleus by regulating tyrosine 707 phosphorylation.",
