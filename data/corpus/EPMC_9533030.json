    "abstract_text": "Complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an important enzyme complex in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the aerobic respiratory chains of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic organisms. In this study, the amino acid sequences of the large (cybL) and small (cybS) subunits of cytochrome b in human liver complex II were deduced from cDNAs isolated by homology probing with mixed primers for the polymerase chain reaction. The mature cybL and cybS contain 140 and 103 amino acids, respectively, and show little similarity to the amino acid sequences of the subunits from other species in contrast to the highly conserved features of the flavoprotein (Fp) subunit and iron-sulfur protein (Ip) subunit. From hydrophobicity analysis, both cybL and cybS appear to have three transmembrane segments, indicating their role as membrane-anchors for the enzyme complex. Histidine residues, which are possible heme axial ligands in cytochrome b of complex II, were found in the second transmembrane segment of each subunit. The genes for cybL (SDHC) and cybS (SDHD) were mapped to chromosome 1q21 and 11q23, respectively by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).",
