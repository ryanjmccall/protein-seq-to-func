Lazio Innova 10.13039/100019470 A0375-2020-36559 Ministero dell''UniversitÃ e della Ricerca 10.13039/501100021856 NA document-id-old-9 jm3c01792 document-id-new-14 jm3c01792 ccc-price Introduction Programmed cell death is an evolutionarily conserved physiological event, essential for intrauterine and postembryonic development and for tissue homeostasis, through the elimination of damaged cells that otherwise would lead to numerous pathological events. 1 Conversely, in humans, excessive apoptosis can lead to a long list of pathological dysfunctions, such as cardiovascular, neurological, and nephrological disorders. There are several types of programmed cell death, including apoptosis mediated by the transition of mitochondrial permeability, 2 which results in an increase in the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM, usually highly impermeable) with consequent osmotic influx of solutes in the mitochondrial matrix and loss of the structural and functional characteristics of the mitochondria involved. 3 The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) state is mediated by the opening of a channel called the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a multiprotein platform consisting of proteins that physically form a pore inside the IMM with negative and positive modulators that contribute to its functional state and its formation mechanism. 4 Among the conditions that favor the opening of mPTP are the increase in the concentration of calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) in the mitochondrial matrix, restoration of pH levels, oxidative stress, and the presence of phosphates, all events that occur in response to injuries due to an ischemia–reperfusion condition (I/R). 4 , 5 Although many of the components and modulators of mPTP have been discovered in recent years, the proteins that delimit the channel are still the subject of intense study. Among the known mPTP modulators are different types of molecules; to cite a few examples, cyclophilin D (CypD) is a soluble protein of the mitochondrial matrix, 6 and its stable depletion has been shown to lead to a protective and desensitization behavior of MPT. Regarding the class of small molecules, triazoles and isoxazoles have been also investigated as potential compounds modulating mPTP opening by targeting the F 1 of ATPase; 7 , 8 meanwhile, urea-based compounds have been shown to inhibit mPTP opening by interacting with the F O domain. 7 In two recent studies, 9 , 10 experimental evidence is provided showing that subunit C of the F 1 /F O -ATP synthase plays a fundamental role in the activity and formation of mPTP, demonstrating in particularly a strong correlation between the expression of the C subunit and the functional state of mPTP. In fact, the depletion of this protein leads to a reduction of the channel opening in response to oxidative stress or calcium-induced stress, while its overexpression stimulates the opening. However, it is worth noting that the role of the C subunit of F 1 /F O -ATP synthase as a key element of the mPTP is still under debate. Recent experiments have provided evidence suggesting that mPTP may persist even after the knockout of the C subunit, 11 even if, in further study, it was seen that this pore has lower conductance compared to the mPTP containing the C subunits. 12 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the C ring, in its native state, does not function as a pore due to the presence of a lipid plug in the center. 13 Therefore, the opening of the mPTP is a multistep process involving (i) the dissociation of F 1 /F O -ATP synthase dimers and (ii) an appropriate conformation of the protein ring consisting of multiple C subunits once these dimers dissociated. Other groups, such as Alavian’s, Azarashvili’s, and collaborators, have independently confirmed these observations by adding important base notions on the properties of the channel 14 and the relative phosphorylation state. 15 The molecular organization of the C subunit in an annular structure (C ring) in IMM causes this to be identified as a key component in the pore assembly process 16 as well as a promising therapeutic target for the pharmacological treatment of programmed cell death. 17 , 18 Although numerous efforts have been made to synthesize and test new inhibitors of the mPTP opening, 19 , 20 to the best of our knowledge, only a few structures have been identified to date showing specificity of interaction with the C subunit. 7 , 16 Indeed, not one reached clinical usage for cardioprotective or nephroprotective purposes for the treatment of ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), which consists of cell death following restoration of blood flowing into the artery affected by ischemia. 18 To date, only the use of broad-spectrum molecular therapies has demonstrated useful efficacy in protecting the organs following reperfusion, while randomized clinical trials focused on more specific drug targets have failed. Therefore, the clinical need for a new pharmacological and/or therapeutic approach for the treatment of pathologies deriving from damage related to reperfusion is still pressing. Results and Discussion Spiropiperidine Binding Site Characterization Given the growing development of computational chemistry methods in the field of molecular modeling, the binding site of the ATP synthase C ring has been characterized to investigate how the biological system interacts with spiropiperidine-based oligomycin-analog ligands. 21 The C ring is a transmembrane homomeric complex composed by 8–14 subunits. In humans, each subunit consists of 136 amino acids, of which 76 are part of the transmembrane portion having a helix–loop–helix structure. As a starting point for the in silico study, the X-ray crystal of the C ring cocrystallized with oligomycin A was used (PDB ID: 4F4S ). 22 Unfortunately, the reported C ring belongs to the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase which presents some differences in the amino acidic sequence compared to the human one. So, the protein was “humanized” via homology modeling using the human c-subunit amino acid sequence extracted from Uniprot 23 (code: P05496) before proceeding with the ligand-binding study (see Figure S1 ). To investigate the binding mode of the spiropiperidine derivatives, we selected the oligomycin A binding site as a hot spot and chose 8-benzyl-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]decan-4-one (compound 1 , Figure 1 ) as a molecular probe since it is the most powerful among the inhibitors tested so far with an mPTP-opening inhibition of 60%. 21 Successively, the induced fit docking (IFD) protocol was pursued to identify the interactions useful for inhibiting the mPTP opening, and the results, shown in Figure 1 A and 1 C, clearly defined three pockets close to the interface between two consecutive subunits as the main structural determinants able to trap possible lead compounds: Pockets A, B, and C. Figure 1 C-subunits–compound 1 complex binding mode. (A) Binding pose of compound 1 against humanized C-ring subunits shown as a colored surface (chain A in cyan and chain B in green, compound 1 in purple) obtained via homology modeling. (B) Ligand interaction diagram of the binding mode. (C) Zoomed-in view of the complex. Yellow dotted lines represent hydrogen bonds; blue dotted lines show π-stacking interactions. Pocket A (identified by the following residues A:124F; A:127M; B:130F; B:127M; B:126L) binds the ligand with hydrophobic and π-stacking interactions established between B:130F, A:124F, and the benzyl moiety (in position 8) of the ligand. The conformational arrangement of the residues characterizing this pocket could host more hindered and complex aromatic structures, thus suggesting that a larger moiety of the ligand in this specific position could increase the interaction with the two aromatic residues, thus enhancing the binding affinity. Pocket B (identified by the following residues B:123L; B:120A; B:116A; B:115F) interacts with the ligand with hydrophobic contacts, mainly with B:123L, properly orienting the imidazolinone head of the ligand toward the following polar pocket C. Pocket C contains B:119E which interacts with the carbonyl group of the ligand in position 4 through a hydrogen-bond interaction mediated by a bridging water molecule, thus corresponding to a possible structural element able to specifically set the spiropiperidine moiety in the right orientation to trap it in the desired A and B hydrophobic pockets. Drug Design and Screening According to previous results, as a scaffold for a set of novel compounds able to selectively bind the C ring, 1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]decan-4-one (spiropiperidine) was used. In order to create the database, a large subset of structures has been retrieved from ZINC15, 24 considering as chemical entities to use as building blocks those previously identified based on the reaction used for the synthesis of spiropiperidine derivatives 21 and detailed below. The building of the compound library and the screening procedure are schematically represented in Figure 2 . Briefly, we have maintained for all of the structures a common spiropiperidinic scaffold and inserted different substituents both in positions 1 (in Figure 2 generally described as R 1 ) and 8 (in Figure 2 referred as R 2 ). Specifically, as building blocks for R 1 , which will undergo Strecker reaction, anilines and benzylamines were selected (6755 reactants), while as building blocks for the R 2 group, alkyl, sulfonyl, and acyl halides with an aromatic moiety (phenyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl, imidazolyl, etc.) were chosen (total of 690 reactants). The aromatic ring was necessary to favor the desired π–π interaction with the two phenylalanines in pocket A. Combining these fragments combinatorially to our spiropiperidine scaffold, 4 660 950 compounds were generated. Figure 2 Schematic representation of the virtual screening protocol. In order to shrink this pool, the database was prefiltered as follows. Physical descriptors have been calculated for each molecule by using the QikProp program (Schrödinger) and thus filtered using Lipinski’s rule of five and PAINS. 25 The obtained refined library was subsequently subjected to 3 different and gradually more strict docking protocols using as the receptor the previously obtained binding complex. All docking procedures were performed with Glide 26 (Schrödinger). As a first step, the database was skimmed via a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) protocol. Then, the first 10% of molecules selected with the highest docking scores underwent a standard precision (SP) docking procedure, and successively, only the best 10% were docked for the last time using the extra precision (XP) docking procedure. The obtained poses were further filtered according to the two structural determinants selected during the characterization of the binding site as follows: (1) measuring the distance between the ligands and the two phenylalanines (F124 and F130), hence eliminating the ligands not interacting with these residues; (2) verifying the presence of a water bridge with E119 (taking inspiration from the oligomycin A behavior) and excluding those ligands missing that specific interaction as a possible key element for the correct orientation of the spiropiperidine compounds. These combined efforts led to narrowing the ligands to 100 candidates. The next step was performed measuring the ligand binding stability by means of 50 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the GROMACS engine. 27 All trajectories have been analyzed calculating the number of contacts between the ligands and the protein and compared to oligomycin A, used as reference. Those compounds which could interact more efficiently with the proteins than the reference, especially with E119, F130, F124, and L123, have been selected and are shown in Figure 3 . Figure 3 Compounds selected to be synthesized as a result of the in silico virtual screening. They can be divided in three families according to the substituent in position 1. Compounds 2 – 5 are derived from aniline. Compounds 6 – 8 are derived from benzylamine. Compounds 9 – 11 correspond to m -hydroxy benzylamine derivatives. All of the compounds of interest have been synthesized, and their biological activity was tested using two different test and cellular lines (described in detail below). Synthesis of Spiropiperidine Derivatives 2 – 11 For the synthesis of compounds 2 – 11 , we were initially inspired by the synthetic route previously developed by our group. 21 Subsequently, we modified the synthesis to achieve the compounds of interest. As a result, we obtained a library of molecules sharing the 1,3,8-triazaspiro-decan-4-one core but differently substituted in both the N 1 and the N 8 positions. In particular, as described in Scheme 1 , derivatives 2 , 6 , and 7 were obtained from an appropriately functionalized piperidone ( 13 and 14 ) and reacted under Strecker conditions with the aromatic or aliphatic amine in the presence of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) to obtain aminonitrile derivatives ( 15 – 17 ). The nitrile group was then hydrolyzed under controlled conditions using concentrated sulfuric acid to achieve an amide function ( 18 – 20 ). A spirocyclization with dimethylformamide/dimethyl acetal (DMF–DMA) was then carried out ( 21 – 23 ). Finally, the C–N double bond was reduced with NaBH 4 in order to isolate the final products.

In the case of derivatives 3 – 5 , we used a commercially available spiropiperidinic compound, which was functionalized with aniline in the N 1 position. The final products were then obtained by acylating ( 3 and 4 ) or alkylating ( 5 ) the nitrogen in position N 8 , as described in detail in Scheme 2 , isolating the corresponding final compounds. The alkylating agent has been prepared with a classical Appel reaction, permitting conversion from a primary alcohol to a bromide derivative ( 24 ).

Piperidone was initially functionalized at position N 8 using benzoyl chloride to obtain compound 25 . Then, due to a treatment with TMSCN in methanol, a mixture of cyanohydrin ( 26 ) and its corresponding silyl ether derivative ( 26a ) was obtained. The ether was then in situ hydrolyzed in acidic conditions to isolate intermediate 26 , which reacts with InBr 3 and benzyl amine, resulting in the amino-nitrile derivative 27 . The subsequent reaction steps, useful to obtain the final product 8 , implicate the same conditions as described above in Scheme 1 . Scheme 3 Synthesis of Compound 8 Reaction conditions.

Finally, derivatives 9 – 11 were obtained by using the appropriate sulfonyl chloride or benzoyl chloride to functionalize the nitrogen in the N 8 position. To derivatize the ketone by the Strecker reaction, a mixture of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride was used to obtain a free primary amine at position N 1 ( 30 – 32 ). The synthetic pathway then proceeded with the hydrolysis of the nitrile group ( 33 – 35 ), cyclization with DMF/DMA ( 36 – 38 ), and subsequent reduction of the C–N double bond, as described in Scheme 4 . At this point, protected m -hydroxy benzyl bromide ( 46 ) was reacted with the spiropiperidinic scaffold to obtain the suitably functionalized core at position N 8 ( 39 – 41 ). After reduction of the C–N double bond ( 42 and 43 ) and hydrolysis of the protecting group under acidic conditions, the compounds of interest 9 – 11 were isolated ( Scheme 4 ).

Biological Evaluation of Spiropiperidine Derivatives on HeLa Cells Using Cobalt–Calcein Assay To assess the efficacy of spiropiperidine derivatives in inhibiting Ca 2+ -mediated mPTP opening, we measured their biological activity in HeLa cells by applying a calcein–cobalt assay protocol. 28 mPTP opening was stimulated by addition of the ionophore ionomycin, and the resulting kinetics were compared (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4 Statistics of PTP activity measurements by applying calcein–cobalt assay in HeLa cells pretreated with either DMSO (vehicle) or 1 μM compounds. Graph shows mean ± SEM. **** p < 0.0001, * p < 0.05. As shown in Figure 4 , addition of 1 μM ionomycin to cells pretreated with 1 μM compounds 2 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , and 11 resulted in a significant desensitization of mPTP opening with the maximum effect achieved by compound 2 with an approximately 57% decrease. Furthermore, compounds 6 and 7 had important biological effects against channel opening. Compounds 3 , 4 , and 8 had the lowest or null effect: these data are consistent with those obtained using measurement of the membrane potential alteration with RPTEC cells, as specified in detail below. Biological Evaluation of Spiropiperidine Derivatives on Renal Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells The general aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of inhibiting mPTP opening. Stimulated by the good data described above, we tried to evaluate the activity of the molecules by analyzing another aspect resulting from the opening of the mPTP, namely, alteration of the cell membrane potential. Since available literature indicates that mPTP opening leads to the loss of the proton gradient, 29 , 30 a different test was used both on HeLa cells and on a more specific cell model, namely, the human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). In this case, membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization has been monitored using Incucyte MMP (mitochondrial membrane potential) Orange Reagent (MMPOR see Figure 5 ). This compound is a cell-permeable, red-orange fluorescent dye that freely passes through cellular and mitochondrial membranes. Due to the large electrochemical H + gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, MMPOR accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix according to Δψ m . Opening of mPTP, due to the introduction of an uncoupling agent such as FCCP, causes an efflux of dye from the mitochondria that manifests as a reduction of fluorescence intensity, which is easily measurable by fluorescence microscopy. Figure 5 (A–C) Plots generated by image analysis on RPTECs: (A) control nontreated cells, (B) pretreated cells with oligomycin A, and (C) pretreated cells with compound 6 . (D) Ligand mPTP inhibition (%) plot of the tested compounds: (orange) oligomycin A; (blue, red, and cyan) most active candidates in mPTP opening inhibition on RPTECs (compounds 2 , 6 , and 7 , respectively). (E) RPTECs stained with Incucyte MMP Orange Reagent before (top) and after (bottom ) the addition of FCCP. B shows a heavy depolarization induced by FCCP in control cells, meanwhile pretreated cells maintain their fluorescence (C and D), even hyperpolarizing (D). The protocol was set up with HeLa cells and then translated to primary cell cultures, RPTECs, as explained in the Materials and Methods . In Figure 5 E, a representative experiment in the RPTECs cells pretreated with Incucyte MMPOR is shown. A clear fluorescence reduction follows the addition of FCCP as expected. Oligomycin A is classified as a mPTP opening inhibitor that targets the c subunit of F 1 /F O ATP synthase. Accordingly, this compound was used as a positive control in these experiments. Briefly, RPTECs were plated to reach a concentration of 6000 cells/well; successively, a staining solution was added to the cells for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Once stained, negative controls were treated with 20 μM FCCP, and images were acquired every 5 s for a total of 15 min. On the other hand, different treatments and positive controls were first incubated with drugs (1 μM) or oligomycin A (1 μM) for other 15 min before acquiring images. Inhibition analysis was performed using a Carl Zeiss microscope with a 40×/0.6-N.A. Acquired data were analyzed using ImageJ and Python libraries. All statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons performed by GraphPad Prism ( p values are reported in the figure legends). Every frame was analyzed by sketching the region of interest (ROI) over the stacked frames and calculating the pixel intensity of these regions. The resulting plots shown in Figure 5 A–C present a curve for each ROI, on which was calculated the slope via linear interpolation between t 0 = 15 s and t 1 = 180 s. Finally, the mPTP inhibition (%) was calculated as follows As can be seen in Figure 5 A, addition of FCCP in controls induces a clear mitochondrial depolarization, resulting in a loss of fluorescence within the first few seconds of the analysis. Oligomycin A, as shown in Figure 5 B, results in a mild protective effect, which is manifested in the persistence of fluorescence at 533 nm for a longer time period (still measurable in the same scale of tens to hundreds of seconds). Lastly, as shown in Figure 5 C, pretreatment of the RPTECs with drug compound 6 not only modulates mitochondrial permeability positively, disfavoring mPTP formation, but also hyperpolarizes mitochondria. Indeed, hyperpolarization effects result in a consistent increase in fluorescence at the same wavelength. Finally, we can state that some compounds have yielded positive results on mPTP inhibition showing a larger effect with respect to the positive control oligomycin A. Among them we can highlight the most promising ones: 2 , 6 , and 7 , see Figure 5 D. It is to be noted that due to the hyperpolarization occurring upon treatment for some ligands (i.e., compounds 2 and 7 ), the mPTP inhibition (%) measured with the formula described above exceeds the 100% threshold; thus, the activity of those compounds has been capped to 100%. Optimized In Silico Binding Study of Spiropiperidine Compounds According to the in vitro promising results obtained, deeper characterization of the binding mode between spiropiperidine compounds and ATP synthase F O subunit was carried out using compound 6 as a probe (being one of the most active molecules). For this refinement, the novel Cryo-EM structure of the Human ATP synthase (PDB ID: 8H9J ) 31 containing all of the subunits of the transmembrane F O portion was used. In fact, in the initial selection process, we presented the binding mode of compound 1 with a humanized C ring using the binding site of oligomycin A as a reference. However, that binding pose was found to be unstable over long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Hence, alternative binding sites have been investigated to find a more suitable complex in light of the different pharmacological properties of spiroderivatives with respect to oligomycin A, 32 suggesting that they have the same topological binding site but are not completely superimposable. In Figure 6 , the transmembrane F O moiety is shown. In this complex, three chains of the c subunit interact with subunit a to give rise to two distinct and possible binding sites, here named 18a and 87a (according to the chains forming them). Figure 6 Transmembrane F O moiety of the ATP synthase, highlighting the oligomycin A binding sites (between c subunit chains) and the putative sites 18a and 87a formed together with subunit a chain. Chains are labeled as in the deposited structure (PDB ID: 8H9J ). On these sites, compound 6 has been docked via induced-fit docking, selecting residues L123, F115, and L117 of chains 1/8 and 8/7 according to the binding site to describe the boxes where the compound will be docked. IFD allows one to find a binding pose in the same topological position of the binding mode previously provided ( Figure S2 ). Both complexes have been tested by performing 500 ns long MD simulation in 3 replicas. Investigating the binding of compound 6 to binding site 18a, we observed that the complex formed is highly unstable. Remarkably, within just a few nanoseconds of the simulation, the ligand undergoes detachment from the binding site. This phenomenon can be attributed to a fundamental issue: the binding site’s limited spatial capacity. The structural intricacies of compound 6 are such that its benzyl group in position 1 becomes a pivotal player in the instability observed. As the ligand occupies binding site 18a, this particular group tends to intrude between the alpha helices of subunit a, as illustrated in Figure S1 . This intrusion, however, comes at a cost: it distorts the native conformation of these alpha helices. During the course of the MD simulations, it becomes evident that the alpha helices have a propensity to naturally revert to their native, energetically favorable conformation. Unfortunately, this inherent tendency further exacerbates the unfavorable interactions with compound 6 , ultimately leading to its detachment from the binding site. In essence, the limited spatial accommodation within binding site 18a combined with the structural clash induced by the compound 6 benzyl group culminates in the ligand’s instability and detachment during the MD simulations. Notably, a strikingly different outcome is observed when compound 6 is introduced to binding site 87a. In this scenario, the benzyl group encounters a more suitable and larger pocket, and as a result, no detachment occurs. In Figure 7 A and 7 B, the most representative conformation obtained from the simulation is shown as well as the schematic binding ( Figure 7 C) and the interaction histograms obtained by analyzing the last 250 ns of three 500 ns MD simulations, Figure 7 D. Figure 7 Compound 6 binding characterization. (A and B) Most representative conformation of compound 6 (in purple) in 87a shown as surface and zoomed-in views of the complex (PDB ID: 8H9J ). (C) Binding scheme of the complex. (D) Interaction histograms of the compound 6 –87a pocket. Results include hydrophobic and polar contacts, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges as determined by analyzing the last 250 ns of three 500 ns MD simulations. Compared to the binding mode obtained from the IFD ( Figure S1 ), the benzyl group (attached to N, position 1) makes space in a pocket inside subunit a, interacting hydrophobically with a:152Q and a:221Y. With this latter amino acid, a persistent π-stacking interaction is established between aromatic moieties. Then, a:152Q and a:221Y polar hydrogens form hydrogen bonds with the amine nitrogen and the sulfone moiety of the tosyl group. As regards the tosyl group, in position 8, it strongly interacts mostly with T-shape and sandwich π-stacking with 8:124F and 7:115F. The tosyl group, thanks to its sulfone group, can interact via a hydrogen bond with a:159R. Lastly, 8:117L and 8:113L make hydrophobic interactions with both the tosyl group and the core of the spiropiperidine scaffold. This binding mode allows this ligand to completely lose the interaction with the key residue of oligomycin interaction E119, making the binding independent from this residue. This description is in accordance with the latest experimental results obtained by Pedriali et al., 32 where the independence of the spiropiperidine compounds binding mode to the residue E119 was confirmed. Pharmacophore Modeling In order to generate the pharmacophore model, the most representative conformation of compound 6 , Figure 7 B, was used. The binding pose was analyzed using the Phase 33 module in the Schrodinger suite. As shown in Figure 8 A, the key features for efficient binding to pocket 87a are as follows: The aromatic rings Ar1 and Ar2; The hydrophobic cores H1 and H2, respectively, the spiropiperidine scaffold and the methyl group of the tosyl moiety; The H-bond acceptor, A1 to interact with a:159R and a:221Y. Figure 8 (A) Pharmacophore model as calculated onto the binding mode of compound 6 . (B, C, D, E, F, and G) Redocking of compounds 2 , 7 , 8 , 3 , 5, and 4 , respectively, into the 87a binding site (PDB ID: 8H9J ). In Figure 8 B–D, the sulfone-derived spiropiperidines are the ones that meet all conditions. Their geometry allows for simultaneous hydrogen-bond interactions and effective placement of the aromatic group within the hydrophobic pocket between chains 8 and 7. Moreover, both the phenyl and the benzyl groups (position 1) can fit into the hydrophobic pocket in subunit a, with the former ( Figure 8 B, compound 2, in pink) engaging in a T-shaped π-stacking interaction with a:221Y and the latter ( Figure 8 C, compound 7, in green) employing a sandwich π-stacking arrangement. Turning our attention to compound 9 ( Figure 8 D, ligand in orange), which is the least active among the sulfone-derived compounds, it still meets all of the pharmacophore features except for Ar1. The presence of a hydroxyl group in the meta position to the benzyl group causes the moiety to shift away from a:221Y, favoring hydrogen-bond interactions with a:225N instead. In contrast, carbonyl-derived spiropiperidine compounds exhibit lower activity compared to their sulfonic counterparts. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the carbonyl group cannot engage simultaneously in hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions. When the carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with a:159R or a:221Y, the aromatic ring moves farther away from the hydrophobic pocket between chains 8 and 7, as demonstrated in Figure 8 E for compound 3 (ligand in gray). Additionally, the carbonyl oxygen prefers interacting with the tyrosine hydroxyl rather than the a:159R guanidine, reducing the interaction of the aromatic moiety in position 8 with the pocket between chains 7 and 8. Introducing the benzothiophene group in compound 5 ( Figure 8 F, ligand in light blue) enhances interaction with the c subunit because of its hindrance, leading to a correlated increase in activity. However, bulkier groups do not yield improved biological activity. In fact, compound 4 ( Figure 8 G, ligand in black) was found to be inactive on RPTECs. The 5-fluoro indole carbonyl group, fitting into the c-ring groove, pushes the ligand downward, improving interaction between the carbonyl and a:221Y hydroxyl, but it results in the loss of π-stacking interaction between tyrosine and the phenyl moiety in position 1. This rearrangement may be the underlying reason for its loss of inhibitory activity. Conclusions Ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) is a pathological condition that occurs after the restoration of blood flow in an ischemia event. The IRI is related to the opening of a mitochondrial transition pore (mPTP) that disrupt the cell homeostasis with the consequent cell death by apoptosis. Nowadays, all of the molecules tested for cardioprotective or nephroprotective purposes have failed in clinical trials. According to an in silico drug design starting from the X-ray crystal structure of the C ring cocrystallized with oligomycin A, we were able to generate a library of millions compounds. Applying a high-throughput virtual screening protocol and standard precision and extra precision (XP) docking procedures combined with molecular dynamics, we selected 10 final compounds to be synthesized, considering different chemical strategies to explore the chemical space around the spiropiperidine core. Finally, in order to evaluate the biological properties of the selected compounds, two different biological testings have been set up, both in immortalized HeLa cell line and in the more specific renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). Among the spiropiperidine-selected molecules, compounds 2 , 6 , and 7 bearing the N 8 sulfonyl amide moiety showed the best inhibition activity on the mPTP opening. These experimental results were further analyzed computationally considering the interaction of these selected molecules with Human ATP synthase (PDB ID: 8H9J ) 31 containing all of the subunits of the transmembrane F O portion. This final refinement allowed us to identify the pharmacophore structure necessary to maximize the interaction with the human protein target. These encouraging results set the stage for their evaluation in an animal model of ischemic–reperfusion injury as a starting point for a proof of evidence-driven design of specific drugs for the treatment of IRI. Materials and Methods Drug Design and Screening The humanized C-ring model system was prepared via homology modeling using Prime, and all proteins were refined with the Protein Preparation Wizard 34 of the Schrodinger Suite. In order to find the binding pose of compound 1 (with humanized C ring) and compound 6 (with the human F O subunit), induced-fit docking 35 , 36 was performed. As regards ligand library creation, building blocks have been retrieved from the ZINC15 database, 24 selecting compounds with a molecular weight of less than 250. This set of molecules was filtered according to their functional groups; for the R 1 group, anilines and benzylamines were selected as they are reactants of the Strecker reaction (6755 molecules), while for the R 2 group, alkyl, sulfonyl, and acyl halides with an aromatic moiety (phenyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl, imidazolyl, etc.) were selected (690 reactants) to satisfy the structural constraint of forming π-stacking with the two phenylalanine residues F130,B and F124,A. The library was made by combining these building blocks to the spiropiperidine scaffold via the Schrodinger Enumeration Library protocol as represented in Figure 9 . The pool of compounds obtained was refined calculating molecular descriptors with QikProp and removing those molecules that did not satisfy Lipinski’s rule of five. Finally, the pool was filtered for PAINS. 25 Figure 9 Representation of the strategy used to build the library. Every building block of one group (i.e., R 1 : 6755 reactants) is added to the spiropiperidine scaffold and combined with all of the other building blocks of the other group ( R 2 : 690 reactants) giving more than 4.5 million compounds as result. The refined data set was prepared with LigPrep 37 before docking. HTVS, SP, and XP docking have been performed with Glide, 26 selecting the best 10% ligands of every docking procedure to be tested on the next one. Molecular Dynamics Simulations The coordinates of each protein–ligand complex were submitted to the CHARMM-GUI server 38 using the High Throughput Simulator tool 39 for membrane proteins. The topologies were generated using the CHARMM36m force field, 40 with the WYF parameter for cation−π interactions, 41 at the atomistic level using TIP3P as water solvent and the phospholipid bilayer of POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine). The total charge of the system was neutralized by randomly substituting water molecules with K + ions and Cl – ions to obtain neutrality with a 0.15 M salt concentration. For every system default minimization, equilibration and production CHARMM-GUI-supplied parameters have been used. Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Trajectory Molecular dynamics simulations have been analyzed using MDAnalysis 42 and PLIP 43 python libraries. Polar and hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the protein residues were modeled as average coordination numbers via a continuous, differentiable switching function with the i and j indexes running over the interacting atoms within the peptide fragment of interest and those within a chosen protein residue with 0 ≤ strength ≤ n i n j (where n i and n j are the total number of atoms of the ligand fragment and the protein residue, respectively, able to make the chosen type of interaction). For hydrophobic interactions, only carbon atoms are considered; for polar interactions, only oxygens and nitrogens are considered. The same “strength” function was calculated for salt bridges and π–cation and π–π interactions. In this case, n i = n j = 1 because virtual atoms are defined at the center of mass of the aromatic rings or charged groups; hence, 0 ≤ strength ≤ 1. For hydrophobic, salt bridge, π–cation, and π–π interactions, a = 6, b = 12, and r 0 = 6, 5, 4, and 5.5 Å, respectively, while for polar interactions, a = 8, b = 12, and r 0 = 2.5. The chosen values of r 0 account for the typical interaction distance plus thermal motion’s amplitude (e.g., ∼4.5 Å + ∼1.5 Å in the case of hydrophobic interactions). These coordination numbers (one per residue of the binding site) can be calculated on single structures as well as averaged along trajectories. Experimental Section Reaction progress and product mixtures were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel (precoated F254 Macherey-Nagel plates) and visualized with a UV lamp (254 nm light source). The organic solutions from extractions were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Chromatography was performed on Merck 230–400 mesh silica gel or using Isolera One (Biotage Sweden). 1 H, 13 C, DEPT, bidimensional (gCOSY), and heterocorrelated (gHMQC, gHMBC) NMR spectra were recorded on a VARIAN Mercury Plus 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) using the peak of deuterated solvents as an internal standard, and coupling constants ( J ) are reported in Hertz. Splitting patterns are designed as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; b, broad. Melting points for purified products were determined in a glass capillary on a Stuart Scientific electrothermal apparatus SMP3 and are uncorrected. Mass spectra were recorded by an ESI single-quadrupole mass spectrometer Waters ZQ 2000 (Waters Instruments UK). For analytical controls, a Beckmann System Gold 168 HPLC apparatus was used with an LC column Kinetex 5-μm EVO C18 100 Å (250 Å, ∼4.6 mm) and a variable-wavelength UV detector fixed to 220 nm. The analysis was conducted using two solutions, A and B, containing 100:0.1 H 2 O:TFA and 40:60:0.1 H 2 O:CH 3 CN:TFA, respectively, with a gradient elution of 0–50% solution B over 30 min. The purity of all compounds was determined by HPLC and was greater than 95%. Mass spectrometric detection was carried out using an electrospray interface (ESI) operated in positive ionization mode. Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas at a 300 L/h flow rate with the desolvation temperature set at 150 °C and the source temperature set at 130 °C. General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 2 , 6 , and 7 1-Tosylpiperidin-4-one ( 13 ) Commercially available 4-piperidone monohydrate hydrochloride (1 equiv) was suspended in a solution of H 2 O and dioxane (1:2, 20 mL), and then Na 2 CO 3 (2 equiv) was added. After 15 min, p -toluene sulfonyl chloride (1.1 equiv) was slowly put in the mixture. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 8–18 h and monitored by TLC (A1P1) and MS-ESI. When complete, the dioxane was evaporated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with AcOEt (3 × 30 mL). The resulting solid was ground with Et 2 O and then filtered to isolate the desired compound 13 .

After 15 min, the reaction was cooled to 0 °C and a solution of 5-chlorothiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride previously dissolved in DCM was slowly added. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 18 h. Once the reaction was completed, as indicated by TLC, the mixture was treated: the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and resuspended in DCM. The organic layer was extracted three times with water, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated in vacuum. The crude brown oil was purified by flash chromatography (3:7 AcOEt/petroleum ether), obtaining the compound 14 as a yellowish solid (1.3 g, yield = 95%).

Then, 3 equiv of TMSCN was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature until completion of the reaction. The progress of the reaction was monitored via TLC and MS-ESI. The mixture was then basified with NaOH 20% until pH = 10; after that, an extraction of the water phase was performed with DCM (3 × 30 mL). The reaction was then dried, and the organic solvent was evaporated: an amorphous solid was obtained, which was titrated with EtOH, to provide a yellowish/orange powder. 4-((4-Chlorophenyl)amino)-1-tosylpiperidine-4-carbonitrile.

Finally, the solvent was evaporated, obtaining a colorless oil in 65% yield. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform- d ) δ 7.18 (t, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 6.97 (dt, J = 7.6, 1.4 Hz, 1H), 6.87 (s, 1H), 6.76 (ddd, J = 8.1, 2.4, 1.0 Hz, 1H), 4.43 (s, 2H), 0.98 (d, J = 0.9 Hz, 10H), 0.20 (s, 6H). Cells Cultures HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM medium with phenol red containing 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% of l -glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . RPTECs were obtained from ATCC and cultured in renal epithelial cell basal medium from ATCC primary cell solutions enriched with a Renal Epithelial Cell Growth Kit at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . mPTP Activity Assay Staining solution (160 nM, Incucyte MMP Orange Reagent) was added to the cells (both HeLa and RPTEK) (∼6 × 10 3 cells/well) for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atm. Image acquisitions were performed with a Carl Zeiss microscope with a 40×/1.30-N.A. Oligomycin A (1 μM) or drugs (1 μM) were administered 15 min before the beginning of the experiment, while controls remained untreated. To induce mPTP opening, cells were treated with FCCP (20 μM). Imaging was performed for 15 min taking a photo every 5 s. ImageJ Analysis ImageJ (NIH) software was used to analyze the pictures. Some regions of interest (ROIs) were selected randomly from the different images. Mean gray values were calculated, and data was exported to Excel. Once the background value was subtracted for each ROI, the resulting data set was normalized. Finally, values were analyzed using the following python libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy. Calcein–Cobalt Quenching Assay HeLa cells were pretreated with either DMSO (Vehicle) or compounds (1 μM) for 15 min and then loaded with calcein acetoxymethyl ester and Co 2+ as previously described. 28 Staining solution was added to the cells for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atm. Image acquisitions were performed with a motorized Olympus IX81-ZDC inverted microscope with a 40×/1.30-N.A. UPlanFLN oil-immersion objective and Cell MT20E xenon lamp. Ionomycin (1 μM) was administered 30 s after the beginning of the experiment to induce mPTP opening. Values of mPTP activity have been calculated as the slope of the kinetics from ionomycin administration to the first 60 s. Statistical Analysis The statistical method included one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons performed by GraphPad Prism. p values are reported in the figure legends or directly in the figure.

  "plain_text": "Finding a therapy for ischemia–reperfusion injury, which consists of cell death following restoration of blood flowing into the artery affected by ischemia, is a strong medical need. Nowadays, only the use of broad-spectrum molecular therapies has demonstrated a partial efficacy in protecting the organs following reperfusion, while randomized clinical trials focused on more specific drug targets have failed. In order to overcome this problem, we applied a combination of molecular modeling and chemical synthesis to identify novel spiropiperidine-based structures active in mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening inhibition as a key process to enhance cell survival after blood flow restoration. Our results were confirmed by biological assay on an in vitro cell model on HeLa and human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and pave the way to further investigation on an in vivo model system."
