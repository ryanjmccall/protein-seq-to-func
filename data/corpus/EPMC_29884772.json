    "abstract_text": "PEX1 and PEX6 are two members of the <u>A</u>TPases <u>a</u>ssociated with diverse cellular <u>a</u>ctivities (AAA) family and the core components of the receptor export module of the peroxisomal matrix protein import machinery. Their role is to extract monoubiquitinated PEX5, the peroxisomal protein-shuttling receptor, from the peroxisomal membrane docking/translocation module (DTM), so that a new cycle of protein transportation can start. Recent data have shown that PEX1 and PEX6 form a heterohexameric complex that unfolds substrates by processive threading. However, whether the natural substrate of the PEX1-PEX6 complex is monoubiquitinated PEX5 (Ub-PEX5) itself or some Ub-PEX5-interacting component(s) of the DTM remains unknown. In this work, we used an established cell-free <i>in vitro</i> system coupled with photoaffinity cross-linking and protein PEGylation assays to address this problem. We provide evidence suggesting that DTM-embedded Ub-PEX5 interacts directly with both PEX1 and PEX6 through its ubiquitin moiety and that the PEX5 polypeptide chain is globally unfolded during the ATP-dependent extraction event. These findings strongly suggest that DTM-embedded Ub-PEX5 is a <i>bona fide</i> substrate of the PEX1-PEX6 complex.",
