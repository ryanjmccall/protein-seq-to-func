  "abstract_text": "Telomeres are essential for preserving chromosome integrity during the cell cycle and have been specifically implicated in mitotic progression, but little is known about the signaling molecule(s) involved. The human telomeric repeat binding factor protein (TRF1) is shown to be important in regulating telomere length. However, nothing is known about its function and regulation during the cell cycle. The sequence of PIN2, one of three human genes (PIN1-3) we previously cloned whose products interact with the Aspergillus NIMA cell cycle regulatory protein kinase, reveals that it encodes a protein that is identical in sequence to TRF1 apart from an internal deletion of 20 amino acids; Pin2 and TRF1 may be derived from the same gene, PIN2/TRF1. However, in the cell Pin2 was found to be the major expressed product and to form homo- and heterodimers with TRF1; both dimers were localized at telomeres. Pin2 directly bound the human telomeric repeat DNA in vitro, and was localized to all telomeres uniformly in telomerase-positive cells. In contrast, in several cell lines that contain barely detectable telomerase activity, Pin2 was highly concentrated at only a few telomeres. Interestingly, the protein level of Pin2 was highly regulated during the cell cycle, being strikingly increased in G2+M and decreased in G1 cells. Moreover, overexpression of Pin2 resulted in an accumulation of HeLa cells in G2+M. These results indicate that Pin2 is the major human telomeric protein and is highly regulated during the cell cycle, with a possible role in mitosis. The results also suggest that Pin2/TRF1 may connect mitotic control to the telomere regulatory machinery whose deregulation has been implicated in cancer and aging.",
