    "full_text_abstract": "We developed a simple method to detect apolipoprotein E (Apo E) polymorphism distribution in approximately 20 microL of unconcentrated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A combination of isoelectric focusing in 3 M urea gel and immunoblotting was employed. Apo E phenotypes were identified in CSF samples from 45 patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD), 15 with multiple sclerosis (MS), and 25 with other neurological diseases (OND). When the data were compared with a set of matched plasma samples, the results were identical. The method is useful for Apo E phenotyping from fresh or frozen unconcentrated CSF, when blood or plasma is not available.",
