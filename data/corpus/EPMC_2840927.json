    "abstract_text": "A cDNA clone, pHGR81, encoding 358 amino-acid residues of the C-terminal region of human elongation factor 2 (EF-2), was isolated from a human ovarian granulosa cell cDNA library. The deduced amino-acid sequence of pHGR81, when compared with the known identical amino-acid sequences of hamster as well as rat EF-2 revealed a substitution of a glutamine by an alanine residue in the partially determined human sequence. The 15 amino-acid-residue sequence comprising the histidine-715, supposed to be of importance for the biological function of EF-2, is preserved in human EF-2. The coding region of the cDNA insert of pHGR81 displays a homology of 87% to hamster and of 88% to rat EF-2 cDNA. In Northern-transfer analysis, pHGR81 specifically hybridizes with an mRNA species of 3.1 kb.",
