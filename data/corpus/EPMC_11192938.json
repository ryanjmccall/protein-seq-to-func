  "abstract_text": "Aspirin therapy inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis; yet via acetylation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) it leads to bioactive lipoxins epimeric at carbon 15 (15-epi-LX, also termed aspirin-triggered lipoxin or ATL). Here, we review our findings indicating that inflammatory exudates from mice treated with omega-3 PUFA and aspirin (ASA) generate a novel array of bioactive lipid signals. Also, human endothelial cells, both HUVEC and microvascular, with upregulated COX-2 and treated with ASA converted C20:5 omega-3 to 18R-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE) and 15R-HEPE. Human PMN activated with serum treated zymosan (STZ) utilized each of these R-HEPEs to generate novel classes of trihydroxy-containing mediators including 5-series 15R-LX and 5,12,18R-triHEPE. The novel products were potent inhibitors of human PMN transendothelial migration and infiltration of PMN in dorsal air pouches in vivo. In addition to ASA, both acetaminophen and indomethacin also permitted 18R-HEPE and 15R-HEPE generation with recombinant human COX-2 as well as omega-5 and omega-9 oxygenations of other fatty acids that act on leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells. These findings establish new transcellular routes for producing arrays of lipid mediators via COX-2-NSAIDs and cell-cell interactions that impact microinflammation. Moreover, they provide novel mechanism(s) that could underlie the many reported therapeutic benefits of omega-3 dietary supplementation of interest in inflammation, cancer, and vascular disorders.",
