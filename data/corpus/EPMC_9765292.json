  "title": "The Bloom's syndrome helicase unwinds G4 DNA.",
  "year": 1998,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/9765292",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "BLM, the gene that is defective in Bloom's syndrome, encodes a protein homologous to RecQ subfamily helicases that functions as a 3'-5' DNA helicase in vitro. We now report that the BLM helicase can unwind G4 DNA. The BLM G4 DNA unwinding activity is ATP-dependent and requires a short 3' region of single-stranded DNA. Strikingly, G4 DNA is a preferred substrate of the BLM helicase, as measured both by efficiency of unwinding and by competition. These results suggest that G4 DNA may be a natural substrate of BLM in vivo and that the failure to unwind G4 DNA may cause the genomic instability and increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange characteristic of Bloom's syndrome.",
