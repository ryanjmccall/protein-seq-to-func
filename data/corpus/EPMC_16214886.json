  "abstract_text": "In this article, we identify and characterize p600, a unique 600-kDa retinoblastoma protein- and calmodulin-binding protein. In the nucleus, p600 and retinoblastoma protein seem to act as a chromatin scaffold. In the cytoplasm, p600 and clathrin form a meshwork structure, which could contribute to cytoskeletal organization and membrane morphogenesis. Reduced expression of p600 with interference RNA abrogates integrin-mediated ruffled membrane formation and, furthermore, prevents activation of integrin-mediated survival pathways. Consequently, knockdown of p600 sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by cell detachment. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of membrane-proximal events in tumorigenesis.",
