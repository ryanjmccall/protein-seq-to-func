  "abstract_text": "Xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) protein is one of the subunits of TFIIH that is required for nucleotide excision repair and transcription. We found a XPD protein complex containing MMS19 that was assumed to be a regulator of TFIIH. However, the MMS19-XPD complex did not contain any other subunits of TFIIH. Instead, it included FAM96B (now designated MIP18), Ciao1, and ANT2. MMS19, MIP18, and XPD localized to the mitotic spindle during mitosis. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMS19, MIP18, or XPD led to improper chromosome segregation and the accumulation of nuclei with abnormal shapes. In addition, the frequency of abnormal mitosis and nuclei was increased in XP-D and XP-D/CS patients' cells. These results indicate that the MMS19-XPD protein complex, now designated MMXD (MMS19-MIP18-XPD), is required for proper chromosome segregation, an abnormality of which could contribute to the pathogenesis in some cases of XP-D and XP-D/CS.",
