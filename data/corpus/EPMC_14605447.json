  "title": "SATB1 makes a complex with p300 and represses gp91(phox) promoter activity.",

  "abstract_text": "The expression of gp91(phox), the key component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, is regulated by various factors binding to its proximal promoter. Two nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding proteins, special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) and CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), have been reported as rare examples of gp91(phox) gene repressors. However, their individual roles and interactions with other factors in the promoter have not been elucidated in detail. We have focused on these two repressive proteins recognizing the bp -115 to bp -106 segment of the gene and obtained the following results: 1. SATB1 makes a complex, mainly with p300, regardless of the presence of DNA. 2. SATB1/p300 complex binding to the 5' upstream AT-rich region in the bp -115 to bp -106 segment represses the gp91(phox) promoter activity, and the repressed activity is partially released by CDP binding to the CCAAT element directly downstream of the AT-rich region. Our findings imply a novel role for p300 in SATB1-associated global transcription regulation.",
