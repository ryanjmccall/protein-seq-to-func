They would like to correct this error and provide a revised figure below. Figure 2 . The effects of CHX and LMB on GSNO-induced cytosolic translocation of APE1. (A) Effect of CHX. 30 h after transfection, cells were treated with 1 mM GSNO for 4 h in the presence or absence of CHX, and then fixed and immunostained by HA antibody and a Texas-red labeled secondary antibody, counterstained with Hoechst 33 342, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. (B) Effect of LMB. HEK293 cells transfected with HA-APE1 were treated with 5 ng/ml LMB for 4 h, followed by 1 mM GSNO for another 4 h, and then the subcellular distribution of HA-APE1 was determined. (C) Positive control of the effect of LMB on the localization of GFP-I\u03baB expressed in HEK293 cells. This correction does not affect the results, discussion and conclusions presented in the article. These details have been corrected only in this correction notice to preserve the published version of record."
