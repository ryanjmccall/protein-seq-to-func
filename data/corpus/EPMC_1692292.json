    "abstract_text": "Genomic clones containing the exons coding for the bait domain of human pregnancy zone protein and alpha 2 macroglobulin were isolated and fragments containing the bait exons were sequenced. It is shown that the bait domains of both alpha 2 macroglobulin and pregnancy zone protein are encoded by two exons, with conserved exon/intron boundaries. A genetic polymorphism showing either a Met or a Val residue as the sixth amino acid of the pregnancy zone protein bait domain was detected with the rare Met allele showing a gene frequency of 0.065.",
