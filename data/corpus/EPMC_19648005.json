    "abstract_text": "A screening campaign of a diverse collection of approximately 250,000 small molecule compounds was performed to identify inhibitors of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) with potential osteogenic activity in osteoblast cells. Compounds were prioritized based on selectivity following a counter-screen against focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a closely related kinase. 4-Amino and 5-aryl substituted pyridinone series were identified that showed strong biochemical potency against Pyk2 and up to 3700-fold selectivity over FAK. Modeling analysis suggested that structural differences in the substrate binding cleft could explain the high selectivity of these chemical series against FAK. Representative compounds from each series showed inhibition of Pyk2 autophosphorylation in 293T cells (IC(50) approximately 0.11 microM), complete inhibition of endogenous Pyk2 in A7r5 cells and increased levels of osteogenic markers in MC3T3 osteoblast cells (EC(50)'s approximately 0.01 microM). These results revealed a new class of compounds with osteogenic-inducing activity in osteoblast cells and a starting point for the development of more potent and selective Pyk2 inhibitors.",
