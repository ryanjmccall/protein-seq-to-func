    "abstract_text": "The three-dimensional structure of human interleukin (IL)-7 has been predicted based on homology to human IL-2, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and growth hormone. The model has a topology common to other cytokines and displays a unique disulfide pattern. Knowledge of the tertiary structure of IL-7 has implications for analysis of key binding regions, suggestions for mutagenesis experiments and design of (ant)agonists. In this context, the model is discussed and compared with other cytokine structures.",
