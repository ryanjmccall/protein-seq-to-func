    "abstract_text": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and alters cell cycle progression, but the viral protein(s) responsible for these activities is unknown. We previously reported that the VZV open reading frame 12 (ORF12) protein triggers phosphorylation of ERK. Here, we demonstrate that the VZV ORF12 protein also activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate cell cycle progression. Transfection of cells with a plasmid expressing the ORF12 protein induced phosphorylation of Akt, which was dependent on PI3K. Infection of cells with wild-type VZV triggered phosphorylation of Akt, while infection with an ORF12 deletion mutant induced less phosphorylated Akt. The activation of Akt by ORF12 protein was associated with its binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K. Infection of cells with wild-type VZV resulted in increased levels of cyclin B1, cyclin D3, and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), while infection with the ORF12 deletion mutant induced lower levels of these proteins. Wild-type VZV infection reduced the G(1) phase cell population and increased the M phase cell population, while infection with the ORF12 deletion mutant had a reduced effect on the G(1) and M phase populations. Inhibition of Akt activity with LY294002 reduced the G(1) and M phase differences observed in cells infected with wild-type and ORF12 mutant viruses. In conclusion, we have found that the VZV ORF12 protein activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate cell cycle progression. Since VZV replicates in both dividing (e.g., keratinocytes) and nondividing (neurons) cells, the ability of the VZV ORF12 protein to regulate the cell cycle is likely important for VZV replication in various cell types in the body.",
