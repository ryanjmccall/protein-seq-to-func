    "abstract_text": "BRCA1 is a well-established tumor suppressor gene, which is frequently mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers. The gene product of BRCA1 functions in a number of cellular pathways that maintain genomic stability, including DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint activation, DNA damage repair, protein ubiquitination, chromatin remodeling, as well as transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. In this review, we discuss recent advances regarding our understanding of the role of BRCA1 in tumor suppression and DNA damage response, including DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA damage repair.",
