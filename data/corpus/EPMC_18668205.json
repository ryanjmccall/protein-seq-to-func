  "abstract_text": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are known to be involved in various processes of growth, differentiation and cell death. In spite of their ubiquitous presence and seemingly enormous cross-talk with each other, their action is very specific. This review deals with various aspects of the three different MAPK pathways (ERK, p38 and JNK) and how their specificity is brought about.",
