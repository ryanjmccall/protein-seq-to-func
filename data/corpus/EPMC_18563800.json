  "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) acts as a potent mitogen for several tumor types and has been reported to positively influence astrocytoma cell growth and motility. In the central nervous system, IGFII bioavailability is mainly modulated by insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), which sequestrates IGFII and therefore prevents its interaction with the type-1 IGF receptor (IGF-IR). Proteolysis of IGFBP2 is the predominant mechanism recognized to reduce the binding affinity of IGFBP2 for IGFII, thus favoring dissociation of IGFII from the IGFBP2-IGFII complex. It is known that certain proteases involved in astrocytoma malignancy, such as matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), plasmin, and cathepsin D, are able to proteolyze IGFBP2 in vitro. The present study aims to investigate whether other proteases expressed by astrocytomas, specifically MMP-2, MMP-9, and membrane-type 1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP), are able to proteolyze the IGFBP2-IGFII complex. Our results show the following: (i) MMP-9 proteolyzes the IGFBP2-IGFII complex in vitro, while MMP-2 and MT1-MMP do not; (ii) this MMP-9-induced IGFBP2-IGFII complex proteolysis releases free IGFII, which contributes to enhance the motility and the growth of LN229 astrocytoma cells. Furthermore, this study also highlights that the formation of the IGFBP2-IGFII complex inhibits IGFBP2's cell motility promoting effect by reducing the pool of free IGFBP2. In conclusion, MMP-9-induced IGFBP2 proteolysis may be regarded as an important post-translational event involved in astrocytoma aggressiveness. These new findings support drug targeting of MMP-9 as an interesting approach in the treatment of astrocytoma.",
