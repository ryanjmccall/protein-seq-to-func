  "abstract_text": "1. The neuronal cytoskeletal protein tau and the carboxy tails of cytoskeletal proteins neurofilament-M (NF-M) and neurofilament-H (NF-H) are phosphorylated on serine residues by the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk-5. 2. In aggregating neuronal-glial cultures we show that veratridine-mediated cation influx causes dephosphorylation of tau, NF-M and NF-H. Dephosphorylation was blocked specifically by cyclosporine A but not by okadiac acid at concentrations up to 200 nM. 3. These results suggest that veratridine-triggered cation influx causes activation of PP-2B (calcineurin) leading to dephosphorylation of these cytoskeletal proteins.",
