  "abstract_text": "Immediate-early response 5 (IER5) is a growth factor-inducible protein with homology to the N-terminus of IER2. Deletion analysis shows that a large region of IER5, including the N-terminal region, is involved in cell growth and stress resistance. The N-terminal region mediates IER5 oligomerization and binding to the B55 regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). IER5 physically interacts with the PP2A target proteins ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and the interactions are essential for the reduced phosphorylation of S6K and HSF1. Our data indicate that oligomeric IER5 regulates PP2A activity and cell growth.",
