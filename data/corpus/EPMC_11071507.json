    "abstract_text": "The authors report a patient carrying a missense mutation in exon 10 of tau that causes a substitution at codon 301 (P301S). Although the patient shares the rapidly progressive frontotemporal dementia of the other reported pedigrees with P301S, the clinical phenotype is unique in that parkinsonism was a major symptom in the early stage and because behavioral symptoms with dementia became prominent 2 years after the onset of the disease. This study substantiates the notion that tau mutations at codon 301 can show various phenotypes.",
