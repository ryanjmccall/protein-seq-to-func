  "abstract_text": "In higher eukaryotes, DVC1 (SPRTN, Spartan or C1orf124) is implicated in the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway. DVC1 localizes to sites of DNA damage, binds to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) via its conserved PCNA-interacting motif (PIP box), and associates with ubiquitin selective segregase p97 and other factors, thus regulating translesion synthesis polymerases. Here, we report the crystal structure of human PCNA in complex with a peptide ((321)SNSHQNVLSNYFPRVS(336)) derived from human DVC1 that contains a unique YF type PIP box. Structural analysis reveals the detailed PIP box-PCNA interaction. Interestingly, substitution of Y331 with Phe severely reduces its PCNA binding affinity. These findings offer new insights into the determinants of PIP box for PCNA binding.",
