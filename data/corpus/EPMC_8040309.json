  "abstract_text": "We aim to correlate point mutations in the androgen receptor gene with receptor phenotypes and with clinical phenotypes of androgen resistance. In two families, the external genitalia were predominantly female at birth, and sex-of-rearing has been female. Their androgen receptor mutation changed arginine-839 to histidine. In a third family, the external genitalia were predominantly male at birth, and sex-of-rearing has been male: their codon 839 has mutated to cysteine. In genital skin fibroblasts, both mutant receptors have a normal androgen-binding capacity, but they differ in selected indices of decreased affinity for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone or two synthetic androgens. In transiently cotransfected androgen-treated COS-1 cells, both mutant receptors transactivate a reporter gene subnormally. The His-839 mutant is less active than its partner, primarily because its androgen-binding activity is more unstable during prolonged exposure to androgen. Adoption of a nonbinding state explains a part of this instability. In four other steroid receptors, another dibasic amino acid, lysine, occupies the position of arginine-839 in the androgen receptor. Androgen receptors with histidine or cysteine at position 839 are distinctively dysfunctional and appear to cause different clinical degrees of androgen resistance.",
