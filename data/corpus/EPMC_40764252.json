ABSTRACT HLA\u2010E is a non\u2010classical HLA class I gene with limited reported genetic variability and few published studies into full\u2010gene sequencing or population allele frequencies. Two protein variants, HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03 , are very common, accounting for 94%\u2013100% of observed alleles in most studies performed to date. Frequently utilised exon\u2010based sequencing strategies have led to the assumption of HLA\u2010E being a near bi\u2010allelic gene; however, recent full\u2010gene sequencing studies have shown a greater degree of genetic variability than initially imagined. We carried out a literature review of HLA\u2010E genotype and ethnicity data, which suggested HLA\u2010E*01:03 is more common in Asian and, in particular, East Asian populations.

These genes are imperative to the body's immune system in mounting immunological responses against pathogenic threats. Arguably, the most important gene system in the MHC is HLA, with the encoded proteins of HLA class I being expressed on almost all nucleated cells of the body [ 2 , 3 ]. HLA molecules present \u201cself\u201d and foreign peptides to immune cells, allowing for immune tolerance of healthy cells and the recognition and targeted killing of infected, tumorigenic and foreign cells [ 4 ]. The HLA genes are believed to be the most polymorphic in the human genome, with a total of 41,003 alleles currently recorded in the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database (Release 3.59, January 2025) [ 5 , 6 ]. Somewhat extraordinarily, the total estimated number of alleles in the worldwide population has been calculated to be around three million for each HLA class I gene [ 6 ]. The six classical HLA genes ( HLA\u2010A , \u2010B , and \u2010C for class I and HLA\u2010DQB1 , \u2010DRB1 , and \u2010DPB1 for class II) have been extensively studied for years and have been shown to play a vital role in the field of transplantation, disease association, and drug\u2010induced hypersensitivity. HLA class I and class II molecules are distinguishable from each other based on their genetic composition, protein structure, and function. There are, however, many HLA genes studied to a lesser extent, one group being the non\u2010classical HLA class I genes. These genes differ from classical HLA class I by their reduced genetic variability, heterogenous cellular expression patterns, and unique peptide presentation repertoires to different parts of the immune system. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of what is known about the structure and function of the non\u2010classical HLA class I molecule HLA\u2010E, in particular focusing on the genetics of HLA\u2010E , its allelic diversity, and provide a thorough and up\u2010to\u2010date overview of the published associations with haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes. 2 HLA \u2010E Structure and Function The HLA\u2010E gene was identified in 1988 as the first non\u2010 HLA\u2010A , \u2010B , or \u2010C class I gene [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]. The genetic structure of the HLA\u2010E gene is very similar to classical HLA class I genes, at approximately 3.5 kb in length, with eight exons. Exon 1 codes for the leader peptide, exons 2, 3, and 4 code for the \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 domains of the protein respectively, exon 5 codes for the transmembrane region, and exons 6 and 7 code for the cytoplasmic tail [ 7 , 8 ]. Together the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains form the antigen recognition domain (ARD), which is responsible for creating appropriate hydrophobic and polar pockets to which specific residues within a peptide chain can interact and stabilise the molecule upon binding [ 10 ]. These exons encode the heavy chain of HLA\u2010E which, analogously to classical HLA class I heavy chain molecules, associates with a \u03b2 2 \u2010microglobulin light chain to form the complete HLA\u2010E molecule capable of presenting peptides on the cell surface [ 9 ]. The relative expression levels of HLA\u2010E molecules vary between cells and tissues; however, universally across all tissues, the transcriptional expression of HLA\u2010E is significantly reduced compared to classical HLA class I molecules [ 11 , 12 ]. The other main disparity between HLA\u2010E and classical HLA class I molecules is its peptide binding repertoire. In most cases, HLA\u2010E is restricted to presenting peptides derived from the leader sequences of other HLA class I molecules [ 11 , 13 ], whereas classical HLA molecules can present a widespread repertoire of peptides to enable immune recognition of almost any possible pathogenic antigen. HLA\u2010E: peptide complexes also function within the immune system in a different manner to classical HLA class I molecules. HLA\u2010E: peptide complexes bind to the CD94/NKG2 family of C\u2010type lectin heterodimeric receptors found primarily on natural killer (NK) cells, but also on certain subsets of CD8 + T cells [ 14 ]. HLA\u2010E can bind to both the NKG2A and NKG2C members of this family, but with a six\u2010fold higher affinity for the CD94/NKG2A receptor [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]. CD94/NKG2A contains immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2010based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic domain, which upon ligand binding, cause inhibition of NK cells' cytotoxic responses [ 17 ]. Conversely, CD94/NKG2C associates with the DAP\u201012 adapter molecule containing immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2010based activating motifs (ITAMs), leading to NK cell activation [ 18 ]. The higher affinity of HLA\u2010E bound to HLA class I leader peptides for the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptor implies that in normal, homoeostatic conditions, HLA\u2010E binding induces inhibition of cytotoxic cellular responses. In doing so, it is acting as a signal to the immune system that the target cell is expressing classical HLA molecules and therefore is not tumorigenic or virally infected, sparing it from cell death. 3 Genetic Variation at the HLA \u2010E Loci Early published research on HLA\u2010E focused on its basic functions in terms of: HLA class I leader peptide binding [ 11 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 20 ], interaction with NK cell receptors [ 14 , 15 , 17 , 21 ] and genetic variation [ 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ]. The majority of these genetic variation studies used sequencing strategies that only covered partial coding sequences (CDS), often just exon 2 and 3, the ARD of the molecule. As this region of the molecule has direct interactions with the peptide, it has often been thought that these exons contain polymorphisms that have the greatest impact on the function of HLA molecules. However, by sequencing only the CDS or selected exons, all genetic variation outside this region remained undetected. Currently, HLA\u2010E has significantly less documented genetic diversity than the classical HLA class I genes, with 376 alleles described in the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database (Release 3.59, January 2025) [ 5 ]. In comparison, there are 8556, 10,346, and 8657 alleles documented for HLA\u2010A , \u2010B , and \u2010C respectively [ 5 ]. Early HLA\u2010E studies looked at genetic variation in individual exons up to exons 2\u20133 as they encode the extracellular domains of the molecule including the ARD. Initial characterisation of classical HLA class I genes similarly only included these exons and yet significant genetic variation was observed between individuals with over 1500 classical HLA class I alleles reported in the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database in 2005 (Release 2.8). In comparison, by 2005, only five HLA\u2010E alleles had been identified, corresponding to what are now known to be HLA\u2010E*01:01 , HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 , HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 , HLA\u2010E*01:03:03 and HLA\u2010E*01:04 [ 7 , 26 , 29 , 30 ]. Across all studies of HLA\u2010E genetic variation since its identification, two protein variants have been observed with consistent and high frequencies: HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03 . Together these alleles account for between 94% and 100% of alleles observed in cohorts; this combined frequency appears consistent across a significant number of ethnicities studied so far [ 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ]. These two alleles differ by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A>G in exon 3, genomic DNA position (g.) 756 (counting from the first base of exon 1). This causes a non\u2010synonymous substitution in codon 107, changing AGG (Arginine) in HLA\u2010E*01:01 to GGG (Glycine) in HLA\u2010E*01:03 [ 8 , 26 ]. An amino acid change from Arginine, bulky and positively charged, to Glycine, small and non\u2010polar, could be expected to induce significant changes in the protein structure. However in HLA\u2010E, this amino acid substitution only causes minor changes in the local structure around residue 107 and has very little impact on the structure of the peptide binding groove and overall molecule [ 38 ]. Despite these subtle changes in structure, the HLA\u2010E*01:03:peptide molecule has increased thermal stability causing a significant increase in cell surface expression compared to HLA\u2010E*01:01 molecules [ 38 , 39 ]. Throughout the HLA community, the initial belief was that only non\u2010synonymous polymorphisms in the CDS resulted in functional differences, although both synonymous and intronic variations are now known to have an impact on the expression and function of HLA [ 40 , 41 ]. Consequently, many studies investigating the association of HLA\u2010E genotypes with disease prevalence or prognosis simplified HLA\u2010E analysis models to only consider the two most prevalent alleles, HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03 [ 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 ]. While the combined frequency of HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03 is consistent and high between studies, the frequency of each allele differs more noticeably. HLA\u2010E*01:01 has been found at frequencies of 24%\u201372% and similarly, HLA\u2010E*01:03 has been reported at frequencies of 28%\u201376%. This variability is potentially due to the ethnicity of the study cohort, patient disease [ 50 ] and/or regions of the gene covered in the different typing strategies used. There are sufficient HLA\u2010E allele frequency and ethnicity data to be able to highlight trends in global HLA\u2010E variation discovered thus far. It has been well\u2010established for many years that ethnicity is a significant factor in the variation of classical HLA [ 51 ]. Considering the lack of high\u2010resolution genotyping and the near bi\u2010allelic nature of HLA\u2010E , however, this might not be as trivial to observe for HLA\u2010E until more higher\u2010resolution genotyping data is available. 4 Population Differences in HLA \u2010E Allele Frequencies Based on the current available literature, HLA\u2010E*01:03 appears to be present at higher frequencies in East Asian populations ranging from 48% to 76% [ 24 , 26 , 28 , 34 , 35 , 48 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 ] and lower in South American, North American and European populations, ranging from 34% to 53% [ 28 , 29 , 32 , 35 , 37 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 ] respectively (Figure 1 ). Calculating the mean weighted average based on sample sizes and plotting this for each country on a world map allows for visualisation of this pattern across the globe (Figure 2 ). Although many countries have no HLA\u2010E allele frequency data, a pattern is visible where Europe and the Americas generally have a lower HLA\u2010E*01:03 frequency, with the allele frequency increasing towards Asia and reaching a maximum in East Asia (Figures 1 and 2 ). Of the African cohorts of individuals typed for HLA\u2010E so far, the mean frequency of HLA\u2010E *01:03 across the continent appears to be close to 50% but demonstrates greater variation than other geographic regions ranging from Burkina Faso in West Africa (60%) to Tunisia in the north (36%) (Figures 1 and 2 ). This concurs with the generally accepted concept that Africa has greater genetic diversity than other regions; however, given that a large proportion of countries in Africa have no data, and the potential for these data to be skewed by lack of numbers, this data should be interpreted with caution [ 66 ]. A mirrored trend also exists for HLA\u2010E*01:01 , observed at higher frequencies in American and European sample groups and lowest in East Asian groups. The caveat to this data is that sample sizes are small for many groups (60% of groups are smaller than 500 samples), so caution should be used before making inferences about whole populations. FIGURE 1 Worldwide HLA\u2010E*01:03 allele frequency grouped by ethnicity. South American cohorts are shown as grey bubbles, African as red, European as coral, North American as violet, South Asian as green and East Asian as brown. Bubble area represents the cohort size. (Made with Piktochart). FIGURE 2 A world map overlayed with HLA\u2010E*01:03 allele frequency depicted by variation from light green to dark green; low to high allele frequency. Countries with no data are shaded grey. This displays the increasing frequency of HLA\u2010E*01:03 moving from Europe across to Asia and in particular East Asia. (Made with Datawrapper). Within the HLA\u2010E*01:03 allele group, there are two highly prevalent synonymous alleles, HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 and HLA*01:03:02 which differ in exon 2 at g.424C>T. Interestingly, this is not mirrored in the HLA\u2010E*01:01 allele group, where the corresponding synonymous allele with this SNP ( HLA\u2010E*01:01:02 ) has been observed at a maximum frequency of 0.3% [ 35 ]. Comparing the proportion of HLA\u2010E*01:03 alleles that are either HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 or HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 also reveals geographic patterns of frequency differences. The relative frequency of HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 versus HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 clearly differentiates in South American, European, and North American sample groups, where HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 is consistently more frequently observed than HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 in these ethnicities (ranging from 52% to 87% compared to 13%\u201348% respectively) (Figure 3 ). A similar observation can also be made in African populations, although there is more variability and overlap across sample groups ( HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 16%\u201386% and HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 8%\u201360%; Figure 3 ). Asian populations demonstrate opposite patterns of relative frequencies, with HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 being observed more frequently. This is more evident in South Asian ethnicities (ranging from 43% to 67%) than East Asian, where there is greater overlap of the observed frequency of the two alleles (Figure 3 ). FIGURE 3 HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 relative allele frequency grouped by ethnicity. Calculated as the proportion of the total HLA\u2010E*01:03 frequency in each cohort. Violet bubbles represent HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 allele frequency, green bubbles represent HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 allele frequency. Bubble area represents the cohort size. (Made with Piktochart). HLA\u2010E*01:04 was first reported in 1990 and identified as differing from HLA\u2010E*01:03 in exon 3 at g.906A>G, R157G [ 26 ]. It was found once in a small cohort of 11 Japanese unrelated blood donors that were investigated to determine if HLA\u2010E variation existed within this population [ 26 ]. Several studies have actively tried to detect this allele without success, and on occasion potential sequence\u2010specific oligonucleotide (SSO) or sequence\u2010specific primer (SSP) based detection of HLA\u2010E*01:04 was checked by SBT and shown to be erroneous [ 23 , 56 , 64 , 67 ]. It has been proposed that HLA\u2010E*01:04 might be a sequencing artefact and not a real allele; however, without re\u2010sequencing the original sample, this cannot be confirmed [ 68 ]. 5 Non\u2010Coding Variation Identified by Full\u2010Gene HLA \u2010E Sequencing More recently, reports have been published that utilise full\u2010gene sequencing of HLA\u2010E ; however, there are only a few such studies, and typically cohort sizes are small [ 57 , 63 , 69 , 70 , 71 ]. One recent paper describes HLA\u2010E variation in a very large cohort of over 2.5 million volunteer haematopoietic cell donors [ 35 ]. From this work, 345 novel HLA\u2010E alleles were identified, and 170 of those were submitted to the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database, which resulted in a significant increase in the documented variation within HLA\u2010E [ 72 ]. Given the very large cohort size, however, this number of new variants does not appear to be suggestive of a similar extent of genetic variation that has been observed in the classical HLA class I loci. A possible reason for this could be the sequencing strategy used in this study for their routine HLA\u2010E typing, which only included parts of exon 2 to exon 3, covering a total of 535 base pairs including the region that distinguishes the HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03 alleles [ 72 ]. More recently, another large study describing the variation of HLA\u2010E in over 6000 samples was published, which utilised full\u2010gene sequencing [ 73 ]. Compared to the study by Paech et al. [ 72 ], the identification of novel genetic variation reported in this study was over 30 times higher, with a total of 86 novel alleles, suggesting there is more variation in the additional exonic and non\u2010coding regions of the gene identified by using the full gene sequencing strategy than had been previously anticipated [ 73 ]. Additionally, there may be differences in the ethnicity of individuals included in each study that have affected the amount of variation observed, with both under\u2010represented populations and less typing of HLA\u2010E overall both affecting the data quality. We hypothesise that with continued full\u2010gene sequencing in larger and more ethnically diverse cohorts, the genetic diversity of HLA\u2010E will be greater than initially suggested. As there appears to be a stabilising selection on HLA\u2010E, making HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03 account for the majority of protein variants observed, it is possible that HLA\u2010E genetic variation has arisen more frequently in non\u2010coding regions. A limitation of previous typing strategies was that any variation in non\u2010coding regions would likely have been missed. In 2006 Pyo et al. [ 74 ] published the first full\u2010gene HLA\u2010E sequencing data on a cohort of 33 cell lines, in doing so finding the first two intronic HLA\u2010E variants, HLA\u2010E*01:01:01:02 and HLA\u2010E*01:03:01:02 [ 74 ]. Yet it was not until recently that the number of studies using full\u2010gene HLA\u2010E sequencing has started to increase and this is now being reflected in the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database where the last 5 years have seen a significant increase in the number of HLA\u2010E alleles submitted (Figure 4 ). As of 2025, there are a total of 141 intronic variants of HLA\u2010E often differing from their closest allele only by a SNP, highlighting the importance of using full\u2010gene sequencing in uncovering the full extent of genetic diversity. FIGURE 4 Cumulative number of HLA\u2010E alleles in the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database up to 2025 (Release 3.59). Coral bars represent the number of novel HLA\u2010E alleles released per year, green bars represent the cumulative number of HLA\u2010E alleles. The first two large batches of novel HLA\u2010E alleles released by the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database occurred in 2019 with release 3.39 and 2020 with release 3.40 (Figure 4 ). The differences between these two batches highlight how large datasets can skew the apparent genetic variability within a gene. In release 3.39, 39 newly identified novel HLA\u2010E alleles were described, 82% of which were non\u2010coding variants and the remaining 18% differed in exons, all of which were identified in our laboratory using the full\u2010gene HLA\u2010E sequencing method described by Lucas et al. [ 73 ]. In the subsequent release 3.40 of the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database, 107 novel HLA\u2010E alleles were published and in contrast to release 3.39, only 7% of the newly described HLA\u2010E alleles were intronic variants, meaning the remaining 93% differed in exons. Again, all of these novel sequences were submitted by one submitter, DKMS Life Science Lab [ 72 ]. The HLA\u2010E genotyping strategy described by this group for bulk genotyping uses a short amplicon NGS method that sequences part of exons 2 and 3 [ 35 ]. Figure 5 shows the distribution of polymorphisms condensed into exons and introns taken from these two releases of the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database, as well as the more recent release 3.59. There were 53 polymorphic positions in non\u2010coding regions and 25 in exons in release 3.39 compared to release 3.40 with 62 in non\u2010coding regions and 114 in exons. This enrichment of documented polymorphic positions in exons 2 and 3 between these two releases is explained by the short, targeted genotyping method used by this group (Figure 5 ). This is further visualised by Figure 6 which displays the number and position of HLA\u2010E polymorphisms in release 3.59 of the IPD\u2010IMGT/HLA Database. Of note are the high frequency SNPs 424C>T and 756A>G, and exons 2 and 3 containing the greatest total number of polymorphisms (counting every occurrence a position varies from the reference HLA\u2010E*01:01:01:01 ) due to the functional relevance that is likely to be correlated with these differences; but also, this is the region covered by the typing strategy utilised by the DKMS Life Science Lab.

Such typing strategies that target a short region are particularly advantageous for very high\u2010throughput processes and could be sufficient to select donors based on HLA\u2010E in the future, if one SNP is shown to be important in transplant outcomes, for example. The trade\u2010off is that such strategies cannot shed light on the full genomic variation of a gene and could lead to a skewed view of genetic diversity, as highlighted here for HLA\u2010E . Full\u2010gene sequencing has the advantage of capturing all variation within a gene, improving our knowledge of its true genetic diversity and facilitating analyses into genomic variation with the caveat of being more resource intensive. Overall, care should be taken when reviewing HLA\u2010E variation given the relatively small number of documented HLA\u2010E alleles and the potential for it to be skewed by large datasets. Understanding the genetic composition and allele frequencies of HLA\u2010E is important if we want to study its impact in complex immune environments such as transplantation. 6 HLA \u2010E in Haematopoietic Cell Transplants Selecting the most appropriate unrelated donors for patients undergoing HCT requires characterisation of several key factors including their HLA genes, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, age, sex at birth and ABO type, as well as other non\u2010clinical considerations such as donor availability. Historically, patients and their unrelated donors were HLA matched for five classical HLA genes: HLA\u2010A , \u2010B , \u2010C , \u2010DRB1 and \u2010 DQB1 , known as a 10/10 HLA match [ 75 , 76 , 77 ]. This was generally accepted and practised as the'bes' HLA match for many years. In the last decade, however, benefits of matching for a sixth gene, HLA\u2010DPB1 , have been shown in relation to patient outcomes [ 78 , 79 ]. Consequently, a 12/12 HLA match including HLA\u2010DPB1 is now considered the gold standard for HCT unrelated donor selection [ 80 ]. The probability of finding a 12/12 HLA matched donor is often lower than a 10/10 HLA match due to the presence of a recombination hotspot located between HLA\u2010DQB1 and HLA\u2010DPB1 [ 81 ]. For patients with less common HLA types, it can be challenging to identify either a 12/12 or a 10/10 HLA match; in these cases, other selection factors have been shown to possibly compensate for the HLA mismatches, including CMV matching, permissive HLA\u2010DPB1 mismatching, or some studies have even suggested selecting for certain non\u2010 HLA genes [ 77 , 78 , 79 , 82 , 83 ]. To date, non\u2010classical HLA class I genes have not routinely been included in HCT donor selection strategies, although it has been suggested HLA\u2010E could play a role in the successful outcomes of HCT and solid organ transplantation given its function in both innate and adaptive immune responses [ 60 , 84 ]. There are limited numbers of studies looking into the impact of HLA\u2010E matching in HCT outcomes, and currently there is no clear consensus as to if, or how, HLA\u2010E should be included in donor selection strategies. In 2005, the first study investigating the impact of HLA\u2010E on HCT outcome was published [ 84 ]. Since then, a total of 19 studies have been published covering an assortment of donor types, ethnicities, and conditioning regimens; the findings of which are summarised in Table 1 . All studies to date have been retrospective analyses. Despite the current era of widespread next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) HLA typing methods, little has been written about the in\u2010depth nature of HLA\u2010E genetics in the context of HCT, often simplifying allelic diversity to only two protein variants, which appears not to be a true representation of the genetic diversity.

The authors concluded that patients receiving a graft from an HLA\u2010E*01:03 positive donor significantly reduced the risk of non\u2010relapse mortality (NRM) [ 84 ]. It was also found that the presence of HLA\u2010E*01:03 in the donor's genotype ( HLA\u2010E*01:01, 01:03 , or HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 ) reduced the risk of severe bacterial infection post\u2010transplant compared to HLA\u2010E*01:01, 01:01 donors [ 84 ]. A small study on 119 sibling transplant pairs suggested that HLA\u2010E*01:03 was associated with a reduced rate of CMV infection compared to HLA\u2010E*01:01, 01:01 genotypes [ 49 ]. Similarly, a more recent study on 100 paediatric HCT patients and their allogeneic donors (78 MUD, 19 sibling, 3 haploidentical) also found the absence of HLA\u2010E*01:03 in the patient was associated with an increase in CMV infection ( HLA\u2010E*01:01, 01:01 68% vs. HLA\u2010E*01:01, 01:03 or HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 53%) [ 93 ]. Not all studies have been able to confirm the beneficial impact of HLA\u2010E*01:03 on viral infection risk. A subsequent study in 187 HLA identical siblings all receiving T\u2010cell replete transplants failed to verify these findings [ 47 ]. This later study also reported that patients and correspondingly their HLA identical sibling donors that were homozygous for the HLA\u2010E*01:03 allele incurred significantly decreased rates of grade II\u2010IV acute graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease compared to any other genotype combination and also reported possible improved overall survival (OS) probabilities [ 47 ]. In a smaller study of 83 patients receiving a T\u2010cell replete, 10/10 HLA, MUD transplant, Danzer et al. [ 42 ] corroborated the protective associations of patient HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotypes on aGvHD, NRM and OS probabilities but also suggested that the genotype was associated with increased disease\u2010free survival (DFS) risk [ 42 ]. The authors did not include donor HLA\u2010E genotype in their analysis because 89% of pairs in this study were HLA\u2010E matched; therefore, it was assumed, but not statistically proven, that the same observations would be found when analysing the donors' genotypes. Analogously, similar results were seen in another two small studies of 56 related and 10/10 HLA MUD transplants, where all patients were HLA\u2010E matched and 80% received a T\u2010cell replete transplant [ 43 , 89 ]. Here, the patient and donor HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype was also significantly associated with decreased risk of aGvHD, chronic GvHD (cGvHD), and disease relapse, while both DFS and overall survival were improved [ 43 , 89 ]. The protective effect of patient HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype was also reported in two published abstracts from one group. It was reported that in a cohort of 100 10/10 HLA, related and MUD transplants, improved overall survival was observed in patients with the HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype, although it is not clear if these two abstracts are from independent cohorts [ 85 , 86 ]. The effect of the HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype was both beneficial and detrimental in the study by Ludajic et al. [ 45 ]. In this cohort of 124 10/10 and DRB3/4/5 HLA MUD transplants, where 76% received T\u2010cell replete transplants and 53% of pairs were HLA\u2010E matched, donor HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype was similarly associated with decreased risk of aGvHD and cGvHD; however, the probability of relapse and NRM were significantly increased [ 45 ]. Mossallam et al. [ 90 ] reported a statistical trend for reduced relapse risk with the presence of HLA\u2010E*01:03 in the patient or donor in another small cohort of identical sibling T\u2010cell replete transplants [ 90 ]. More recently, in a large cohort of 1629 haploidentical transplants, Petersdorf et al. [ 94 ] described protective associations of the patient genotype HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 on NRM and mortality. Furthermore, they were able to show a link between donor receptor (NKG2A and NKG2C) and patient ligand (HLA\u2010E) genotype pairings, suggesting the precise combinations of these receptor\u2010ligand pairs are important in HCT patient clinical outcomes [ 94 ]. The data from these studies suggest a protective effect of the HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype on several of the common post\u2010transplant complications that can occur (Table 1 ). However, the impact of small and diverse cohort sizes may affect the data reported and contribute to the inconsistent findings observed. Many of these studies included patients and donors with matching HLA\u2010E genotypes; therefore, whether these effects originate from the patient or donor genotype is unclear and needs to be investigated explicitly in MUD transplants and in larger cohorts before conclusions can be drawn. Several hypotheses for why HLA\u2010E*01:03 might be beneficial in the HCT setting have been proposed. Due to the known higher surface expression of HLA\u2010E*01:03 molecules, it is postulated that they are more effective at presenting pathogen\u2010derived peptides to CD8 + T cells, thus improving their ability to clear infections [ 84 ]. Higher expression levels of HLA\u2010E*01:03 are also thought to confer protection against the risk of GvHD due to the increased inhibition of NK cells via NKG2A, reducing their cytotoxicity against host cells [ 42 , 47 ]. This effect could be especially pronounced in endothelial tissues as these cells have considerable HLA\u2010E expression [ 42 , 43 , 97 ]. Higher expression and peptide binding affinity of HLA\u2010E*01:03 were also proposed to be the cause of a reduced probability of relapse, due to the increased efficiency of peptide presentation to CD8 + T cells inducing a stronger graft\u2010versus\u2010leukaemia (GvL) effect [ 90 , 98 ]. Another possible mechanism is through the competition of HLA\u2010E*01:03 with classical HLA class I molecules for peptides that would otherwise induce CD8 + T cell\u2010mediated cytotoxicity. It is proposed that the binding of these peptides by HLA\u2010E molecules reduces the available pool of peptides for classical HLA molecules to bind. In this situation, it is suggested that HLA\u2010E would present these peptides poorly, thus not inducing effective T cell responses [ 47 ]. Such mechanisms remain hypotheses until they can be explicitly shown in the HCT setting. Furthermore, only three studies have been able to show a donor genotype effect in explicitly MUD cohorts (Table 1 ). These are the most informative findings, as donor HLA\u2010E genotype is a variable that could be selected for during the unrelated donor selection process. It is vital to fill this gap in knowledge if HLA\u2010E is to be used in donor selection in the future. 6.2 Detrimental Impact of HLA \u2010E*01:03 In striking contrast to the early reports of a beneficial impact of the presence of HLA\u2010E*01:03 in either patient or donor genotypes in smaller and somewhat heterogeneous cohorts, larger studies failed to confirm these observations, conversely reporting a detrimental effect of this genotype (Table 1 ). In a cohort of 509 10/10 HLA, MUD HCTs where 63% of patients received a T\u2010cell depleted transplant and 63% of pairs were HLA\u2010E matched, patients with the HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype were found to have an increased probability of NRM and decreased DFS and overall survival, compared to patients with other genotypes [ 91 ]. The detrimental impact of HLA\u2010E*01:03 on the probability of DFS was also found by the largest HLA\u2010E study to date published in 2019, consisting of 1840 10/10 HLA, MUD transplant pairs, of which 67.5% were HLA\u2010E matched [ 92 ]. In this study, they reported an increased probability of disease relapse and decreased risk of DFS when donors with HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype were used [ 92 ]. Similar findings were observed in a large cohort of single HLA mismatched unrelated donor transplants primarily investigating the role of the HLA\u2010B leader peptide on transplant outcomes [ 95 ]. Here, the patient genotype HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 was associated with increased relapse and decreased DFS [ 95 ]. Likewise, a similar study of 903 single HLA\u2010B mismatched (9/10) unrelated donor transplants identified a detriment to DFS with the donor HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype and an increase in risk of grade II\u2010IV aGvHD with the donor genotype HLA\u2010E*01:01, 01:03 [ 96 ]. Due to the HLA mismatched setting of these two cohorts, consideration must be taken if comparing results to those from matched transplants. The association of HLA\u2010E*01:03 homozygous donors with increased risk of disease relapse was also reported in a cohort of HLA identical sibling HCT in Mardani et al. [ 46 ]. The large 2019 study also split their cohort by the use of T\u2010cell depletion in the transplant regimen and reported increased risks of NRM and overall survival when patients received a graft from a donor with the HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype in patients undergoing a T\u2010cell replete transplant compared to those receiving T\u2010cell deplete grafts [ 92 ]. These findings were substantiated in a study of 93 related and MUD transplants, where patients receiving a graft from a donor with the HLA\u2010E*01:03, 01:03 genotype were reported to have a three\u2010fold increased risk of death [ 44 ]. Together, these studies suggest the use of related or unrelated donors with HLA\u2010E*01:03 alleles in their genotype could be correlated with worse patient prognosis post\u2010HCT, in contrary to the previously mentioned results (Table 1 ). It has been hypothesised that the same proposed mechanism behind improved patient outcomes associated with the presence of HLA\u2010E*01:03 may also be responsible for detrimental outcomes. With its higher surface expression, HLA\u2010E*01:03 inhibits NK cells via the NKG2A receptor more effectively than HLA\u2010E*01:01 , in doing so reducing NK cell cytotoxicity against the tumour, resulting in increased relapse [ 99 ]. Alternatively, Tsamadou et al. [ 92 ] suggested HLA\u2010E*01:01 may in fact bind tumour peptides more effectively, therefore inducing anti\u2010leukaemia responses of CD8 + T cells. While Tsamadou et al. [ 92 ] observed this effect only held true in patients receiving T cell replete transplants, Kordelas et al. [ 44 , 92 ] reported only transplants using ATG for T cell depletion had an impact of donor HLA\u2010E genotyping on patient outcomes. This suggests that the effect HLA\u2010E genotype has on HCT outcomes could be strongly linked to the specific conditions of the individual transplant. Therefore, to understand in which situations HLA\u2010E genotype can be beneficial to transplant outcomes, future studies should focus on using homogeneous cohorts to give the best chance of being able to validate the findings. 6.3 HLA \u2010E Allele Matching In contrast to classical HLA locus matching for HCT, fewer studies have identified an impact of direct HLA\u2010E allele matching on patient outcome. HLA\u2010E allele mismatching was reported to be a risk factor for increased mortality in a cohort of 460 otherwise HLA\u2010mismatched unrelated donors [ 88 ]. In contrast to all other studies discussed, each patient in this study cohort was mismatched for at least one classical HLA locus, potentially changing the immune environment after transplantation. Conversely, in a cohort of 509 10/10 HLA MUD HCTs, HLA\u2010E mismatching was associated with reduced probability of NRM and increased probability of DFS and OS, possibly suggesting that the single\u2010locus mismatches may be correlated with the observations in the first study and that the true impact of HLA\u2010E allele mismatching may have been masked [ 91 ]. The protective impact of HLA\u2010E mismatching was reported to be much more pronounced in patients with advanced disease stages compared to early/intermediate, in this second study [ 91 ]. HLA\u2010E mismatching has also been correlated with the risk of GvHD and infection. In two published abstracts describing the findings of 100 MUD and related donor HCTs, patients receiving HLA\u2010E mismatched grafts were reported to have increased risks of aGvHD and reduced risk of viral infection in comparison to HLA\u2010E matched patients [ 86 ]. The detrimental impact of HLA\u2010E mismatching on aGvHD risk was also reported more recently (71% vs. 57% for HLA\u2010E mismatched and matched pairs respectively) [ 93 ]. Tsamadou et al. [ 91 ] similarly reported that HLA\u2010E mismatching was associated with reduced risk of bacterial infection post\u2010HCT (9.5% vs. 17.2%); however, conversely to other studies, they found an improvement to both aGvHD (7.7% vs. 12.3%) and cGvHD [ 91 ]. The authors identified that this reduction in cGvHD was significant in patients with advanced disease stages, but no effect was seen in early/intermediate stages [ 91 ]. In contrast to these studies, the large study by Tsamadou et al. [ 92 ] was not able to confirm that HLA\u2010E matching had any significant effect on any of the measured endpoints. In a cohort of HLA\u2010B mismatched transplants, a reduction in the risk of relapse was observed with HLA\u2010E mismatches by Petersdorf et al. [ 96 ], but only if the mismatch was in the host\u2010versus\u2010graft direction. There are fewer studies investigating HLA\u2010E matching compared to patient or donor HLA\u2010E genotype in HCT, and it is obvious that additional, larger, and more homogeneous studies are needed to properly assess the effect of HLA\u2010E matching. The proposed explanations for HLA\u2010E mismatching impacting HCT outcomes are that different HLA\u2010E alleles are able to present different repertoires of non\u2010canonical peptides in stress conditions, and these are proposed to preferentially bind to CD8 + T cells instead of NKG2A receptors [ 100 ]. The presence of mismatched HLA\u2010E alleles means the repertoire of peptides that can be presented by HLA\u2010E is increased, making it more likely for HLA\u2010E: peptide complexes to activate CD8 + T cells [ 91 ]. Tsamadou et al. [ 91 ] suggested this is one possible cause for the reduction in infection and increase in DFS observed, whereby HLA\u2010E mismatching induces a stronger immune response from NK and CD8 + T cells. Interestingly, among all studies that included cohorts of 10/10 HLA MUD transplants, an average of only two thirds of patients and donors had identical HLA\u2010E genotypes (calculated from data in Table 1 ). This shows that even when matching HLA at the five classical loci typically considered for HCT, the inclusion of HLA\u2010E genotyping data would enable different haplotype identification in at least a third of cases. This number would undoubtedly increase by using full\u2010gene HLA\u2010E genotyping instead of exon\u2010based sequencing or other typing techniques, by identifying additional polymorphisms that would reveal different haplotypes. Our data from a cohort of 876 UK MUD HCTs, genotyped for HLA\u2010E using full\u2010gene TGS, corroborates this observation, where 60% of pairs were matched for HLA\u2010E at the CDS level, but decreases to 51% when matching for the whole HLA\u2010E gene is considered [ 73 ]. Classical HLA genes are the most important genes in transplant outcomes; however, there are many other genes in the MHC that could affect HCT outcome. While not necessarily functionally relevant, matching for these additional genes could be a proxy for a haplotype matched donor, which has been shown to reduce GvHD in patients post\u2010HCT [ 101 , 102 ]. HLA\u2010E is located roughly in the middle of a 1.2 M base (Mb) region between HLA\u2010A and HLA\u2010C. This provides a greater possibility for a recombination event to have occurred between the two genes. If this occurred between two haplotypes with a common HLA\u2010A genotype, this could create distinct haplotypes that may not be identified by routine HLA genotyping strategies but differ from the common haplotype upstream of HLA\u2010A to the end of the chromosome. This explains the rationale for including HLA\u2010E in donor matching, helping to distinguish haplotypes that were identical across the classical HLA genes, thereby moving closer to a haplotype match as demonstrated recently by Sayer et al. [ 103 ]. The advantages of matching patients and donors by resolving more of the MHC or to a higher resolution by using ultra\u2010high resolution HLA genotyping have been demonstrated [ 104 , 105 ]. Both of these studies found a reduction in aGvHD, and one found an improvement in overall survival associated with 12/12 ultra\u2010high resolution HLA genotyping [ 104 , 105 ]. Additionally, in our cohort of 876 UK MUD HCTs, 24.7% of pairs that were previously matched at 12/12 HLA loci had mismatched HLA\u2010E alleles, showing HLA\u2010E matching is even able to distinguish haplotypes in this 12/12 ultra\u2010high resolution HLA genotyping setting [ 73 ]. 7 Functional Implications of HLA \u2010E Diversity Beyond the formerly discussed mechanisms, HLA\u2010E genotypes influence NK cell function in part through their involvement in NK cell education. Specifically, HLA\u2010E molecules are central to one of two mechanisms of NK cell education and therefore differences in HLA\u2010E expression levels and peptide repertoire could change the education of these cells [ 98 ]. A well\u2010documented example of this is the HLA\u2010B \u221221 M/T dimorphism: Methionine (\u221221M) leader sequences enhance surface expression and promote effective education of NKG2A + NK cells which have a more potent cytotoxic potential, whereas Threonine (\u221221T) leaders do not [ 106 , 107 ]. Consequently, alongside HLA\u2010B \u221221M/T, differential expression of HLA\u2010E proteins (e.g., HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03) and differential peptide repertoires could also modulate NK cell functionality via this route [ 106 , 108 ]. This HLA\u2010E\u2010dependent axis has been linked to stem cell transplantation outcomes across multiple settings [ 95 , 96 , 109 , 110 ]. Interestingly, peptides that induce high expression of HLA\u2010E do not necessarily confer the strongest binding to NKG2 receptors and peptide variation outside the canonical nonamer also impacts HLA\u2010E presentation, highlighting the nuances of this pathway [ 111 ]. Following CMV reactivation, an expansion of NKG2C + and corresponding reduction of NKG2A + NK cells along with activation of NKG2A + NK cells has been demonstrated [ 112 ]. This further supports an adaptive role of HLA\u2010E in shaping NK cell functionality and thus potentially GvL or GvHD responses. NK education calibrates the potency of NK cells and is crucial for generating effective immune responses, which is especially important in the context of HCT and with HLA\u2010E being central to this. HLA\u2010E also modulates CD8 + T cell responses against infections like CMV and HIV by presenting a more diverse repertoire of viral peptides via TAP\u2010independent pathways that bypass CMV mediated TAP inhibition [ 113 , 114 , 115 ]. CMV enhances HLA\u2010E expression by mimicking the canonical VL9 peptide, evading NK cells but exposing itself to HLA\u2010E\u2010restricted CD8 + T cell responses [ 114 ]. In a cancer setting, these T cells can also recognise tumour\u2010derived peptides, contributing to GvL effects, including through TCR\u2010independent mechanisms [ 116 , 117 ]. Notably, unlike conventional CD8 + T cells, the selection by either thymic epithelial or haematopoietic cells shapes the phenotype and effector functions of HLA\u2010E\u2010restricted CD8 + T cells [ 118 , 119 ]. There are several factors that make establishing a consensus on the impact of HLA\u2010E genotyping data on HCT outcomes difficult: the overall shortage of studies, small cohort sizes, heterogeneity in transplant conditions and limited HLA\u2010E genotyping (Table 1 ). Most cohorts are small and the reported data differences between them are likely indicative of this limitation. Two studies to date have included more than 500 transplant pairs within their study cohorts, which has led to more convincing findings, but that still require confirmation in independent, and possibly larger cohorts, before they could be considered for transplantation into clinical practice. Additionally, as shown in Table 1 , the transplant protocols and conditions vary greatly between each study; therefore, the reported effects may not persist in other settings, which makes understanding the underlying biology difficult. Finally, all studies characterised HLA\u2010E alleles based on limited regions of the gene and in many cases using non\u2010sequencing techniques. Exon 3 was the only region genotyped across all studies and only three studies also included exon 2, likely because when most of these studies were published, few HLA\u2010E alleles had been identified and even less was known about intronic polymorphism within the gene. As such, what is being reported by one study as an HLA\u2010E*01:03 , for example, might not be the same as an HLA\u2010E*01:03 in another study. All of these disparities between studies only muddies the water further and makes identifying the truth beneath more difficult. To summarise, there are two leading avenues for investigating the impact of HLA\u2010E genotypes on HCT patient outcomes. Selecting donor HLA\u2010E alleles for their functional differences, as is presumed to be the case with HLA\u2010E*01:01 versus HLA\u2010E*01:03 , or matching patient and donor HLA\u2010E genotypes for distinguishing otherwise identical haplotypes and reducing incompatibility across other regions of the MHC. Whether one or both of these avenues can be truly impactful on HCT outcomes is not yet known, especially when considering how the nuances of different transplant conditions could alter the relationship of HLA\u2010E with patient outcomes. Evidently, the role of HLA\u2010E genotypes and matching in HCT remains unclear; however, with additional retrospective studies on larger cohorts, a clearer picture into the impact of HLA\u2010E genotype may become evident.

    "full_text_abstract": "ABSTRACT HLA\u2010E is a non\u2010classical HLA class I gene with limited reported genetic variability and few published studies into full\u2010gene sequencing or population allele frequencies. Two protein variants, HLA\u2010E*01:01 and HLA\u2010E*01:03 , are very common, accounting for 94%\u2013100% of observed alleles in most studies performed to date. Frequently utilised exon\u2010based sequencing strategies have led to the assumption of HLA\u2010E being a near bi\u2010allelic gene; however, recent full\u2010gene sequencing studies have shown a greater degree of genetic variability than initially imagined. We carried out a literature review of HLA\u2010E genotype and ethnicity data, which suggested HLA\u2010E*01:03 is more common in Asian and, in particular, East Asian populations. Furthermore, HLA\u2010E*01:03:02 is more frequently observed than HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 in European and American populations, whereas HLA\u2010E*01:03:01 is found at higher frequencies in Asian populations. It has been proposed that HLA\u2010E may have a role in Haematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) due to its interaction with NK and CD8 + T cells and its non\u2010canonical peptide binding repertoire. Here we also review published literature into the effects of HLA\u2010E genetics on HCT outcomes. Heterogeneity between cohorts muddies the waters; hence, studies report confounding effects of HLA\u2010E genotype and matching on HCT outcomes. The need for further HLA\u2010E sequencing of larger cohorts is evident to gain useful insight into the true genetic variability of HLA\u2010E and its impact on HCT."
