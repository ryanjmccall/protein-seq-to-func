    "abstract_text": "Several apolipoproteins are known to be closely associated with amyloid fibrillogenesis. Serum amyloid A, apolipoprotein (apo) AII and apo A1 are each deposited as biochemically distinct forms of amyloid. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease is linked to one isotype of apo E, apo E4. Apo E and apo E4 in particular have been shown to modulate amyloid fibril formation by amyloid-beta peptides in vitro. Furthermore, the carboxy terminus of apo E has been shown to be a constituent of plaque amyloid. We show immunohistochemically and electron microscopically the presence of apo A1 in senile plaques. The intact apo A1 can itself form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro that are Congo Red positive. We propose that some proteins when misfolded can propagate this misfolding to identical units, either autocatalytically or to other proteins that are induced to fold into the same abnormal conformation. This conformational mimicry may initiate and/or augment fibrillogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.",
