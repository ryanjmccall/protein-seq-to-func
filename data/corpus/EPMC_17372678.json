    "abstract_text": "Multiple cellular functions of urokinase and its receptor are associated with the receptor's capability to interact with a number of ligands at the molecular level. The presence of urokinase is generally needed for the urokinase receptor to acquire this capability. Recent X-ray studies of the structure of the urokinase receptor in complex with either its ligand or peptide inhibitors demonstrate the flexibility of the domain organization of the receptor, suggesting that unliganded urokinase receptor may exist in a latent form that has a conformation different from its ligand-binding form.",
