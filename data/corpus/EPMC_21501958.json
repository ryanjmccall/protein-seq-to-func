    "abstract_text": "The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is the core component of nuclear substructures that host more than 70 proteins, termed nuclear domains 10 or PML-nuclear bodies. PML was first identified as the gene participating in the translocation responsible for the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The notion that PML is a tumor suppressor gene was soon extrapolated from leukemia to solid tumors. The last decade has radically changed the view of how this tumor suppressor is regulated, how it can be therapeutically targeted, and how it functions. Notably, one of the most recent and striking features uncovered is how PML regulates cellular homeostasis outside its original niche in the nucleus. These new findings open an exciting new area of research in extra-nuclear PML functions.",
