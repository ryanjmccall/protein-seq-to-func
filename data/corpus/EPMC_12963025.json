    "abstract_text": "The neurotrophin receptor p75NTR can induce signal transduction both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanisms by which p75NTR transduces signals have remained mostly unknown. Using yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the Ran-binding protein (RanBPM) as an interactor with the intracytoplasmic domain of p75NTR (p75ICD). The interaction was then validated by immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells and immunoblotting analysis. The domain in p75ICD interacting with RanBPM was mapped to the death domain.",
