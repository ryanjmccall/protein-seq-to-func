Data were extracted from OSU Endocrine Neoplasia Repository (ENR). Medullary thyroid cancer was excluded. The treating physician determined patient management. Statistical analysis was performed with the chi-square test for categorical values and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous unpaired values. Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Out of 320 patients, 152 patients had a positive mutational profile. Of these, 128 patients had a BRAFV600E mutation and 14 had a RAS mutation.

Local lymph node metastasis was significantly less in RAS mutated cancer (58% vs 16%, p<0.05). Lymph node metastasis was limited to N1a in all RAS group, whereas 38% of BRAFV600E had N1b status. The number of positive lymph nodes were significantly fewer in the RAS group (mean 0.42 vs. 9.1, p=0.003). None of the patients in RAS group developed subsequent local neck recurrence, whereas 19% of BRAFV600E group developed a recurrence (p=0.05). Bone metastasis was more common in RAS compared to BRAFV600E group (21% vs 6%, p=0.04) but there were no differences in other distant metastases. Presence of extrathyroidal extension was significantly higher in BRAFV600E compared to RAS group (58 % vs 8%; p=0.04). Classic variant papillary thyroid cancer was the most common histologic diagnosis with both mutations, however, follicular-variant papillary thyroid cancer was more common in RAS than BRAFV600E group (29% vs 8%, p=0.04) and follicular thyroid cancer was only seen in the RAS group (25% vs 0%, p<0.05). There was no difference in gender, age at diagnosis, disease status after initial therapy, RAI treatment, RAI dosage, and mortality between the groups.

None of the patients in RAS group developed subsequent local neck recurrence, whereas 19% of BRAFV600E group developed a recurrence (p=0.05). Bone metastasis was more common in RAS compared to BRAF V600E group (21% vs 6%, p=0.04) but there were no differences in other distant metastases. Presence of extrathyroidal extension was significantly higher in BRAFV600E compared to RAS group (58 % vs 8%; p=0.04).
