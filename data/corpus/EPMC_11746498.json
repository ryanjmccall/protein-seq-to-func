  "abstract_text": "Human cells with osteogenic capacity were studied for differential gene expression. In the first part of the study we compared gene expression of marrow stroma cells (MSC) in comparison to matured osteoblasts cultured from trabecular bone (TBC) that were analyzed by RT-PCR for series of messages. High expression was detected for PTH-r, TGFb1 and biglycan in TBC compared to MSC's. The messages for c-MYC, IL-6, IL-11, M-CSF, osteonectin, and osteocalcin were expressed at the same level in the two populations of cells. In the second part of the study, we analyzed gene expression within the MSC derived from 25 donors (2.5-49 years old) with respect to donors' age and gender. Increased message levels for M-CSF and biglycan were measured in correlation with age of the donors. Gender differences did not affect the expression of cytokines studied (IL-6, IL-11, MCSF, TGFb1). We investigated the effect of Dexamethasone treatment on MSC and monitored an increased expression of IL-11, M-CSF, biglycan, and osteocalcin messages. This study employs primary cell systems (MSC and TBC) to illustrate differential gene expression by osteoblastic cells. The expression was correlated with maturation status of the cells with respect to differences between donors.",
