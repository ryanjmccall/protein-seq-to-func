    "abstract_text": "Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) are related tyrosine kinases that have important cellular functions, primarily through regulation of the cytoskeleton. Recent studies have identified multiple molecular mechanisms that regulate cytoskeletal responses, and have provided important and exciting insights into how FAK and Pyk2 control cellular processes such as cell migration. Equally exciting are reports of novel and originally unanticipated functions of these kinases, providing the groundwork for future avenues of investigation. This Commentary summarizes some of these recent discoveries that are relevant to the control of biological responses of the cell.",
