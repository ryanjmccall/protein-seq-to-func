  "abstract_text": "LIM domains-containing protein 1 (LIMD1) is encoded at chromosome 3p21.3, a region commonly deleted in many solid malignancies. However, the function of LIMD1 is unknown. Here we show that LIMD1 specifically interacts with retinoblastoma protein (pRB), inhibits E2F-mediated transcription, and suppresses the expression of the majority of genes with E2F1-responsive elements. LIMD1 blocks tumor growth in vitro and in vivo and is down-regulated in the majority of human lung cancer samples tested. Our data indicate that LIMD1 is a tumor-suppressor gene, the protein product of which functionally interacts with pRB and the loss of which promotes lung carcinogenesis.",
