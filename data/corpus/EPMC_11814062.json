  "abstract_text": "The intracellular signaling pathways mediating the nuclear exclusion of the androgen receptor (AR) by melatonin were evaluated in PC3 cells stably transfected with the AR. The melatonin-induced nuclear exclusion of the AR by melatonin (100 nM, 3 h) was blocked by LY 83583 (an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclases). 8-Bromo-cGMP (a cell-permeable cGMP analog), mimicked the effect of melatonin, as did ionomycin (a calcium ionophore) and PMA [an activator of protein kinase C (PKC)], and their effects were blocked by GF- 109203X (a selective PKC inhibitor). BAPTA (an intracellular calcium chelator) blocked the effects of melatonin and 8-bromo-cGMP but not of PMA. Inhibition or activation of the protein kinase A pathway did not affect basal or melatonin-mediated AR localization. We conclude that the melatonin-mediated rise in cGMP elicits AR nuclear exclusion via a pathway involving increased intracellular calcium and PKC activation. These results define a novel signaling pathway that regulates AR localization and androgen responses in target cells.",
