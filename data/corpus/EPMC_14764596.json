    "abstract_text": "The vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) gene locus contains eight exons that span 14 kb. Alternative splicing generates multiple, different mRNAs that in turn translate into at least five protein isoforms. While the canonical AUG start codon is located at position 1039 in exon 1, there also exists an upstream, in-frame CUG initiation codon that drives expression of L-VEGF, containing an additional 180 amino acids. Two separate internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) regulate the activity of each initiation codon. Thus the 5'-UTR of VEGF, which comprises the majority of exon 1, consists of IRES B, the CUG, IRES A, and the AUG, from 5' to 3'. Previously, it has been shown that IRES B regulates initiation at the CUG and IRES A regulates AUG usage. In this study, we have found evidence that the exon content of the VEGF mRNA, determined through alternative splicing, controls IRES A activity. While the CUG is most efficient at initiating translation, transcripts that lack both exons 6 and 7 and therefore contain an exon 5/8 junction lack AUG-initiated translation. The process of splicing is not responsible for this start codon selection since transfection of genomic and cDNA VEGF sequences give the same expression pattern. We hypothesize that long range tertiary interactions in the VEGF mRNA regulate IRES activity and thus control start codon selection. This is the first report describing the influence of alternatively spliced coding sequences on codon selection by modulating IRES activity.",
