    "abstract_text": "The p44 subunit plays a crucial role in the overall activity of the transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH: on the one hand its N-terminal domain interacts with and regulates the XPD helicase (, ); on the other hand, as shown in the present study, it participates with the promoter escape reaction. Mutagenesis along with recombinant technology using the baculovirus/insect cells expression system allowed us to define the function of the two structural motifs of the C-terminal moiety of p44: mutations within the C4 zinc finger motif (residues 291-308) prevent incorporation of the p62 subunit within the core TFIIH. Double mutations in the RING finger motif (residues 345-385) allow the synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond by RNA polymerase II, but prevent its escape from the promoter. This highlights the role of transcription factor IIH in the various steps of the transcription initiation process.",
