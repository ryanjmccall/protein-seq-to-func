    "abstract_text": "Receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is crucial for signal transduction by creating high affinity binding sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing molecules. By expressing the intracellular domain of Flt-1/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 in the baculosystem, we identified two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites at Tyr-1213 and Tyr-1242 and two minor tyrosine phosphorylation sites at Tyr-1327 and Tyr-1333 in this receptor. This pattern of phosphorylation of Flt-1 was also detected in vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated cells expressing intact Flt-1. In vitro protein binding studies using synthetic peptides and immunoblotting showed that phospholipase C-gamma binds to both Y(p)1213 and Y(p)1333, whereas Grb2 and SH2-containing tyrosine protein phosphatase (SHP-2) bind to Y(p)1213, and Nck and Crk bind to Y(p)1333 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. In addition, unidentified proteins with molecular masses around 74 and 27 kDa bound to Y(p)1213 and another of 75 kDa bound to Y(p)1333 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. SHP-2, phospholipase C-gamma, and Grb2 could also be shown to bind to the intact Flt-1 intracellular domain. These results indicate that a spectrum of already known as well as novel phosphotyrosine-binding molecules are involved in signal transduction by Flt-1.",
