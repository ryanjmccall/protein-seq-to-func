  "abstract_text": "The gp130-like receptor (GPL) is a recently cloned member of the family of type I cytokine receptors. The name reflects its close relationship to gp130, the common receptor subunit of the interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokines. Indeed, the recently proposed ligand for GPL, IL-31, is closely related to the IL-6-type cytokines oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor, and cardiotrophin-1. The second signal transducing receptor for IL-31 seems to be the oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRbeta). The present study characterizes in depth the molecular mechanisms underlying GPL-mediated signal transduction. GPL is a strong activator of STAT3 and STAT5, whereas STAT1 is only marginally tyrosine-phosphorylated. We identify tyrosine residues 652 and 721 in the cytoplasmic region of the longest isoform of GPL (GPL(745)) as the major STAT5- and STAT3-activating sites, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate Jak1 binding to GPL and its activation in heteromeric complexes with the OSMRbeta but also in a homomeric receptor complex. Most interesting, unlike OSMRbeta and gp130, GPL is insufficient to mediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We propose that this is due to a lack of recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 or the adaptor protein Shc to the cytoplasmic domain of GPL.",
