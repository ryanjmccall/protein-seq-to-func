  "title": "\"Researching the Research\" in Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Bibliometric Analysis of the Top 100 Cited Articles in the Field of Prostate Cancer.",
  "year": 2017,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC5814779",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "<h4>Background</h4>To perform the first comparative bibliometric analysis of the \"Top 100 (T100) cited articles in prostate cancer (PCa)\".<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A comprehensive search using the Web of Science Database (v 5.21) covering the Web of Science™ Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, Central Contents Connect, KCI-Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE, SciELO Index (February 2016) was performed, for all articles relevant to PCa.<h4>Results</h4>The T100 were cited 582 to 3,387 times, and were published from 1966 to 2012. The top 3 subcategories associated with PCa included: genetics/biomarkers (n = 34), management (n = 25), and physiology (n = 11). T100 contributions from USA (n = 86), were most prominent. If the regional citation was corrected for percentage on research (citation record/percentage gross domestic product on research) a variation in the ranking was noted.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The first bibliometric analysis in the field of PCa is presented. Regions that predominate the T100, include the United States and Europe. Articles published in higher impact factor journals, in English medium and content related to PCa research associated with genetics/bio-markers have the highest citation potential.",
