  "abstract_text": "We have identified the presence of leupaxin (LPXN), which belongs to the paxillin extended family of focal adhesion-associated adaptor proteins, in prostate cancer cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that LPXN is a component of the podosomal signaling complex found in osteoclasts, where LPXN was found to associate with the protein tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and c-Src and the cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase-proline-, glutamate-, serine-, and threonine-rich sequence (PTP-PEST). In the current study, LPXN was detectable as a 50-kDa protein in PC-3 cells, a bone-derived metastatic prostate cancer cell line. In PC-3 cells, LPXN was also found to associate with Pyk2, c-Src, and PTP-PEST. A siRNA-mediated inhibition of LPXN resulted in decreased in vitro PC-3 cell migration. A recombinant adenoviral-mediated overexpression of LPXN resulted in an increased association of Pyk2 with LPXN, whereas a similar adenoviral-mediated overexpression of PTP-PEST resulted in decreased association of Pyk2 and c-Src with LPXN. The overexpression of LPXN in PC-3 cells resulted in increased migration, as assessed by in vitro Transwell migration assays. On the contrary, the overexpression of PTP-PEST in PC-3 cells resulted in decreased migration. The overexpression of LPXN resulted in increased activity of Rho GTPase, which was decreased in PTP-PEST-overexpressing cells. The increase in Rho GTPase activity following overexpression of LPXN was inhibited in the presence of Y27632, a selective inhibitor of Rho GTPase. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LPXN forms a signaling complex with Pyk2, c-Src, and PTP-PEST to regulate migration of prostate cancer cells.",
