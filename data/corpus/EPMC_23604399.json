  "abstract_text": "Genetic recombination is the creation of new gene combinations in a cell or gamete, which differ from those of progenitor cells or parental gametes. In eukaryotes, recombination may occur at mitosis or meiosis. Mitotic recombination plays an indispensable role in DNA repair, which presumably directed its early evolution; the multiplicity of recombination genes and pathways may be best understood in this context, although they have acquired important additional functions in generating diversity, both somatically (increasing the immune repertoire) and in germ line (facilitating evolution). Chromosomal homologous recombination and HsRad51 recombinase expression are increased in both immortal and preimmortal transformed cells, and may favor the occurrence of multiple oncogenic mutations. Tumorigenesis in vivo is frequently associated with karyotypic instability, locus-specific gene rearrangements, and loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor loci - all of which can be recombinationally mediated. Genetic defects which increase the rate of somatic mutation (several of which feature elevated recombination) are associated with early incidence and high risk for a variety of cancers. Moreover, carcinogenic agents appear to quite consistently stimulate homologous recombination. If cells with high recombination arise, either spontaneously or in response to \"recombinogens,\" and predispose to the development of cancer, what selective advantage could favor these cells prior to the occurrence of growth-promoting mutations? We propose that the augmentation of telomere-telomere recombination may provide just such an advantage, to hyper-recombinant cells within a population of telomerase-negative cells nearing their replicative (Hayflick) limit, by extending telomeres in some progeny cells and thus allowing their continued proliferation.",
