  "abstract_text": "The TATA box-binding protein (TBP) is required by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases for correct initiation of transcription of ribosomal, messenger, small nuclear, and transfer RNAs. The cocrystal structure of the C-terminal/core region of human TBP complexed with the TATA element of the adenovirus major late promoter has been determined at 1.9 angstroms resolution. Structural and functional analyses of the protein-DNA complex are presented, with a detailed comparison to our 1.9-angstroms resolution structure of Arabidopsis thaliana TBP2 bound to the same TATA box.",
