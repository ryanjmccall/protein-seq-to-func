    "abstract_text": "Oestrogen receptor (ER) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene methylation was evaluated in neoplastic and perineoplastic breast tissues from 20 patients. In both tissues, ER gene methylation was inversely correlated with protein levels, while EGFR gene methylation was not. A preferential ER gene hypomethylation was found in neoplastic tissues, suggesting a significant role in neoplastic transformation.",
