  "abstract_text": "The major isoenzymes of cytosolic glutathione transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) from rat, mouse, and man are shown to share structural and catalytic properties that can be used for species-independent classification. Rat, mouse, and human isoenzymes were grouped with respect to amino-terminal amino acid sequences, after correlation of seven structures analyzed in the present investigation with structures determined earlier. The isoenzymes were also characterized by substrate specificities and sensitivities to inhibitors, and the data were subjected to pattern recognition analysis. In addition, the various isoenzymes were tested for cross-reactivity by immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against rat and human transferases. The different types of data were clearly correlated and afforded an unambiguous division of the isoenzymes into three classes named alpha, mu, and pi. Each of the three mammalian species studied contains at least one isoenzyme of each class. It is suggested that the similarities of the isoenzymes in a class reflect evolutionary relationships and that the classification applies generally.",
