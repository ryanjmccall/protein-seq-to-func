CCR2 is expressed on monocytes, immature dendritic cells and T cell subpopulations, and mediates their migration towards endogenous CC chemokine ligands such as CCL2 1 . CCR2 and its ligands are implicated in numerous inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases 2 including atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, neuropathic pain, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as cancer 3 . These disease associations have motivated numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials 4 (see ClinicalTrials.gov) in search of therapies that target the CCR2:chemokine axis. To aid drug discovery efforts 5 , we solved a structure of CCR2 in a ternary complex with an orthosteric (BMS-681 6 ) and allosteric (CCR2-RA-[ R ] 7 ) antagonist. BMS-681 inhibits chemokine binding by occupying the orthosteric pocket of the receptor in a previously unseen binding mode. CCR2-RA-[ R ] binds in a novel, highly druggable pocket that is the most intracellular allosteric site observed in Class A GPCRs to date; this site spatially overlaps the G protein-binding site in homologous receptors. CCR2-RA-[ R ] inhibits CCR2 non-competitively by blocking activation-associated conformational changes and formation of the G protein-binding interface. The conformational signature of the conserved microswitch residues observed in double-antagonist-bound CCR2 resembles the most inactive GPCR structures solved to date. Like other protein:protein interactions, receptor:chemokine complexes are considered challenging therapeutic targets for small molecules, and the present structure suggests diverse pocket epitopes that can be exploited to overcome drug design obstacles. Main A ternary complex between an engineered construct of human CCR2 isoform b (further referred to as CCR2-T4L or simply CCR2), an orthosteric antagonist BMS-681 (compound 13d in 6 ), and an allosteric antagonist CCR2-RA-[ R ] 7 was crystallized using the lipidic cubic phase method 8 , and the structure was determined to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution ( Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Simultaneous addition of two compounds dramatically stabilized detergent-solubilized CCR2-T4L in comparison with twice the concentration of each compound individually ( Fig. 1a ), suggesting concurrent binding of CCR2-RA-[ R ] and BMS-681 to the receptor. The presence of both compounds was critical for crystallization. In the structure, CCR2 adopts the canonical fold of class A GPCRs with seven transmembrane (TM) helices connected by three extracellular (EC) and three intracellular (IC) loops ( Fig. 1b ). Both compounds are visible ( Fig. 1b\u2013d ); BMS-681 binds in the extracellular orthosteric pocket ( Fig. 1b, c ) while CCR2-RA-[ R ] is located more than 30\u00c5 away ( Fig. 1b, d ), in a site that is the most intracellular allosteric pocket observed in Class A GPCRs to date ( Fig 1e ). The binding site of CCR2-RA-[ R ] spatially overlaps with the G protein-binding site in homologous receptors ( Fig 1f ). As for other chemokine receptors 9 \u2013 12 , CCR2 is expected to have two conserved disulfide bonds in its extracellular domains, with Cys32-Cys277 connecting the N-terminus (NT) to ECL3, and Cys113-Cys190 connecting TM3 to ECL2. Electron density is apparent for the ECL2-TM3 disulfide bond but not for the NT residues 1\u201336 or the NT-ECL3 disulfide bond ( Fig. 1b, c ). Because the NT-ECL3 disulfide bond has been shown important for CCR2 signaling 13 , its absence is unlikely to be an inherent feature of the receptor; instead, it might be caused by strain of the bond in the ligand-bound state of the receptor 14 , possibly exacerbated by solvent exposure and radiation damage of the crystals 15 . As with other chemokine receptors, the extracellular orthosteric pocket of CCR2 can be divided into a major and a minor subpocket, defined by helices III\u2013VII and helices I\u2013III, VII, respectively, and separated by residues Y120 3.32 and E291 7.39 (superscript indicates residue number as per Ballesteros-Weinstein nomenclature). BMS-681 binds predominantly in the minor subpocket ( Fig. 2a,b ) and buries 366.3 \u00c5 2 of surface area. The 6-trifluoromethyl quinazoline moiety protrudes between helices I and VII towards the lipid bilayer, while the tri-substituted cyclohexane packs against W98 2.60 . The \u03b3-lactam secondary exocyclic amine forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of T292 7.40 , which is critical for binding of chemically related compounds such as BMS-558 (compound 22 in 16 ) and the Teijin lead series 17 , 18 . This amine is also within hydrogen bonding distance from the backbone carbonyl of Q288 7.36 . The carbonyl oxygen of the \u03b3-lactam forms a hydrogen bond with Y49 1.39 , which itself is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of T292 7.40 . The N1 nitrogen of the quinazoline is within 4 \u00c5 of the Q288 7.36 side chain. The protonated tertiary amine on the cyclohexane ring is proximal to a structured water molecule in the binding site. Some CCR2 antagonists, particularly those containing a basic amine, are known to depend on the conserved E291 7.39 in the receptor 19 ; however, no direct interaction is observed between E291 7.39 and BMS-681. The receptor-bound, bioactive conformation of BMS-681 is strikingly similar to the crystallographic conformation of free BMS-681 ( Fig. 2c , Extended Data Table 2 ) suggesting the absence of internal strain in the bound state. BMS-681 engages several residues that are critical for CCL2 binding and/or activation of CCR2 17 , 18 including Y49 1.39 , W98 2.60 , Y120 3.32 , and T292 7.40 . Thus, it seems to directly compete with chemokine binding to the orthosteric pocket. Additionally, by inserting between helices I and VII, BMS-681 may put strain onto residues C32-V37 connecting TM1 to ECL3, destabilize the conserved NT-ECL3 disulfide bond (absent in the structure), and prevent the N-terminus and TM1 from adopting a productive chemokine binding conformation observed in homologous receptor:chemokine structures 11 , 12 ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). On the opposite side of the receptor, CCR2-RA-[ R ] is caged by the intracellular ends of helices I\u2013III and VI\u2013VIII and buries 297.8 \u00c5 2 of surface area. The inner hydrophobic part of the cage is made by V63 1.53 , L67 1.57 , L81 2.43 , L134 3.46 , A241 6.33 , V244 6.36 , I245 6.37 , Y305 7.53 , and F312 8.50 , while the outer (cytosol-facing) polar part consists of T77 2.39 , R138 3.50 , G309 8.47 , K311 8.49 , and Y315 8.53 ( Fig. 2d, e ), as well as the backbones of engineered R237 6.29 and K240 6.32 . The binding pocket of CCR2-RA-[ R ] is highly enclosed and possesses a balanced combination of hydrophobic and polar features, all of which favors pocket \u201cdruggability\u201d 5 . Owing to the lack of a side-chain on G309 8.47 , the hydroxyl and pyrrolone carbonyl groups of CCR2-RA-[ R ] can hydrogen-bond to the exposed backbone amides of E310 8.48 , K311 8.49 , and F312 8.50 ( Fig. 2d, e ). The acetyl group of the compound resides near the terminal amine of K311 8.49 . The critical roles of V244 6.36 , Y305 7.53 , K311 8.49 , and F312 8.50 in CCR2-RA-[ R ] binding were established by an earlier mutagenesis study 20 . Because homologs of several residues in the CCR2-RA-[ R ] binding pocket directly couple to the G protein in bovine rhodopsin 21 and the \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR) 22 structures ( Extended Data Fig. 3 ), CCR2-RA-[ R ] appears to sterically interfere with G protein binding to CCR2. The structure suggests an interesting symmetric mechanism for the concurrent antagonistic action of the two compounds. BMS-681 interferes with chemokine binding directly and with G protein coupling indirectly, by stabilizing an inactive, presumably G protein-incompatible 6 conformation of the receptor. Conversely, CCR2-RA-[ R ] directly prevents G protein coupling and allosterically inhibits binding of the CCL2 chemokine 23 , which, like most GPCR agonists, requires an active, G protein-associated receptor for high affinity binding 23 . Bi-directional allosteric communication between the extra- and intracellular sides of the receptor is reminiscent of that previously observed in adenosine A 2A receptor (AA 2A R) 24 and \u03b2 2 AR 25 using allosteric inverse agonist antibodies/nanobodies that target the same epitope as CCR2-RA-[ R ]. Similar to these antibodies, CCR2-RA-[ R ] was previously shown to allosterically enhance, and to be allosterically enhanced by, binding of orthosteric antagonists 23 , i.e. to demonstrate positive binding cooperativity. We further characterized this cooperativity by studying the binding of BMS-681 to WT CCR2 and the crystallization construct CCR2-T4L using previously characterized radioactive probes [ 3 H]-INCB-3344 23 (orthosteric) and [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA (allosteric). In equilibrium competition binding assays on WT CCR2, both INCB-3344 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] displaced their homologous radioligand with IC 50 values of 17 and 13 nM, respectively ( Extended Data Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Table 3 ), comparable to previously reported values 23 . Compared to WT CCR2, the affinity of both antagonists towards CCR2-T4L was improved by approximately 2-fold, suggesting a slight engineering-related shift towards the inactive state. BMS-681 fully displaced [ 3 H]-INCB-3344 with nanomolar affinities for both constructs, but did not displace [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA. Instead, at 1 \u03bcM concentration it enhanced the binding of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA by >30% ( Extended Data Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Table 3 ). In kinetic radioligand experiments, the presence of BMS-681 also increased total binding of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA to both WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L, with the increase as high as 62% in the case of CCR2-T4L ( Extended Data Fig. 4c\u2013d , and Extended Data Table 4 ). 1\u03bcM BMS-681 decreased the dissociation rate constant of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA, while producing a slight increase (WT CCR2) or no change (CCR2-T4L) in the observed association rate constants. Moreover, in CCR2-T4L, the presence of BMS-681 changed the biphasic dissociation profile of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA to monophasic, suggesting stabilization of the receptor population in a homogenous conformational state ( Extended Data Table 4 ). Along with the stability and equilibrium binding data, these results further corroborate the hypothesis that BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] cooperatively stabilize a preferred inactive conformation of CCR2-T4L. We next analyzed the structure of double-antagonist-bound CCR2-T4L to better understand this conformation. The plethora of existing class A GPCR structures suggests a conserved conformational signature of an active receptor state 26 . This signature involves separation between the intracellular end of helix VI and the rest of the TM bundle, an inward repositioning and rotation of helix VII, and concerted repacking of the highly conserved microswitches R 3.50 (of the DR 3.50 Y motif), Y 5.58 , and Y 7.53 (of the NPxxY 7.53 motif) ( Fig. 3a, b ) to form an intracellular binding interface for G protein. Furthermore, rather than adopting either an \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d state, receptors can occupy an ensemble of intermediate conformations 27 . The active state signature is fully represented in US28, the only agonist-bound chemokine receptor crystallized to date 12 ( Fig. 3a\u2013c ). By contrast, the double-antagonist-bound CCR2 structure appears to occupy the opposite end of the activation spectrum as it shares the conformational microswitch signatures of the most inactive GPCR structures observed thus far ( Fig. 3a\u2013e ). As in the inactive CCR5:Maraviroc complex 10 , the intracellular ends of CCR2 helices III and VI are close together, and the conserved R 3.50 interacts with D 3.49 and T 2.39 , effectively disrupting the G protein binding pocket ( Fig. 3b, d, e ). Similarly, in both CCR2 and CCR5 structures, the intracellular end of helix VII is in the inactive outward-facing conformation with Y 7.53 pointing towards helix II rather than the center of the bundle. However, in CCR5, Y 5.58 is oriented towards the center of the bundle, whereas in the present CCR2 structure, it faces the lipid and is sterically blocked from approaching R 3.50 and Y 7.53 by F 6.38 ( Fig. 3d, e ). The net result of these interactions is that the crystallographically observed conformation of CCR2 appears to be even more inactive than that of CCR5 and most similar to dark rhodopsin 28 and Fab-bound \u03b2 2 AR 29 . Although receptor construct engineering appears to contribute to stabilization of this inactive state, the ligand binding and thermal denaturation data suggest that the concerted action of the two antagonists is also important. By directly interacting with the conserved activation microswitch residues, CCR2-RA-[ R ] is perfectly positioned to stabilize this inactive state: it sterically blocks Y 7.53 from populating the active conformation and is propped against R 3.50 , restricting its orientation away from the G protein interface ( Fig. 3b ). Although located 30 \u00c5 away, BMS-681 appears to cooperate with CCR2-RA-[ R ] through their common interactions with helix VII, which moves outward on the intracellular side (opposite to its movement during activation) and inward on the extracellular side (relative to CCR5 and US28) ( Fig. 3f ). The CCR2 structure has general implications for the design of drugs targeting chemokine receptors as a family. As with most protein:protein interfaces, the orthosteric binding pockets of chemokine receptors are large, wide open, and highly polar. Chemokines explore numerous hotspots within these pockets and their binding is additionally reinforced by the interaction with the flexible N-termini of the receptors 11 , 12 ( Fig. 4a ), collectively making for an extensive and versatile interaction that is conceptually difficult to inhibit with small molecules. The CCR2:BMS-681:CCR2-RA-[ R ] structure extends the repertoire of ideas that can be employed to overcome these obstacles. The binding mode of BMS-681 ( Fig. 4b ) contrasts with both the binding mode of Maraviroc to CCR5 ( Fig. 4c ) where the ligand spans the major and the minor subpocket of the receptor, and that of IT1t to CXCR4 ( Fig. 4d ) where the ligand is entirely accommodated in the minor subpocket. While occupying the minor subpocket of CCR2, BMS-681 protrudes between helices I and VII towards the lipid bilayer ( Fig. 4b ) in an interaction facilitated by the trifluoromethyl group that is often present in CCR2 antagonists 30 . This interaction enables hydrophobic anchoring of BMS-681 to the otherwise polar and open binding site of CCR2; by doing so, it parallels the role of other unique non-polar subpockets exploited by crystallized small molecule antagonists of CCR5 and CXCR4 ( Fig. 4b\u2013d ). The novel subpocket explored by BMS-681 may have an additional advantage of disrupting the chemokine-compatible conformation of the receptor N-terminus ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). CCR2-RA-[ R ] demonstrates a previously unseen binding mode within an allosteric pocket on the intracellular side of CCR2. Although relatively small, this pocket has a desirable balance of polarity and hydrophobicity ( Fig. 2e and 4e ). Homologous pockets may be present in other chemokine receptors, owing to a conserved G 8.47 ; in fact, compound binding in homologous regions has been indirectly demonstrated for CCR1 and CCR5, and directly for CCR4 31 , CXCR1, and CXCR2 32 . In most other receptors that have been crystallized thus far, the non-glycine residue at position 8.47 appears to both reduce the pocket volume and block access to the backbone amides of helix 8; consequently, the homologous pockets in these receptors may not be druggable although negative allosteric modulation with antibodies and nanobodies targeting the same region has been reported 24 , 25 . By simultaneously competing with G protein and blocking activation-related conformational changes, compound binding in the allosteric pocket appears a powerful way to antagonize the receptor. Therefore, for those receptors in which the allosteric pocket is druggable, targeting it with small molecules may open new avenues for GPCR drug discovery. Methods Design and Expression of CCR2-T4L fusion constructs The sequence of human CCR2 isoform b (Uniprot ID P41597-2) was engineered for crystallization by truncation of C-terminal residues 329\u2013360 and by grafting T4 lysozyme (T4L) into the ICL3. In the process of construct optimization, the native CCR2 residues between L226 5.62 and R240 6.32 (L226 5.62 -KTLLRCRNEKKRH-R240 6.32 ) were removed and replaced with corresponding residues from the crystallized structure of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (PDB ID 3UON, resulting amino-acid sequence S226 5.62 -RASKSRI-T4L-PPPSREK-K240 6.32 ). The presence of T4L in ICL3 is expected to prevent receptor activation; however the similar affinities of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] for both WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L ( Extended Data Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Table 3 ) suggest that the fusion construct is a good surrogate of WT CCR2 for understanding ligand recognition. The CCR2-T4L coding sequence was cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) with an HA signal sequence followed by a FLAG tag at the N-terminus and a PreScission protease site followed by a 10xHis tag and another FLAG tag at the C-terminus. The receptor was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf9 ) cells. High-titer recombinant baculovirus (>10 9 viral particles per ml) was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) as previously described 11 . Sf9 cells at a cell density of 2\u20133 \u00d7 10 6 cells ml \u22121 were infected with P1 virus at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 48 h post-infection and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Purification of CCR2-T4L Insect cell membranes were prepared by thawing frozen cell pellets in a hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Extensive washing of the raw membranes was performed by repeated douncing and centrifugation in the same hypotonic buffer (2\u20133 times) and then in a high osmotic buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (3\u20134 times), thereby separating soluble and membrane associated proteins from integral transmembrane proteins. 40 mM stock solutions of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] were made in isopropanol. Washed membranes were resuspended into a buffer containing 50 \u03bcM BMS-681, 2 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h before solubilization. The membranes were then solubilized in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl- \u03b2 -D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 0.2% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS, Sigma) at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h. The supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 50,000g for 30 min, and incubated in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl with TALON IMAC resin (Clontech) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After binding, the resin was washed without addition of ligands with 10 column volumes of Wash I Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) DDM, 0.02% (w/v) CHS, 10 mM imidazole), followed by 4 column volumes of Wash II Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS, 50mM imidazole). The protein was then eluted with 3\u20134 column volumes of Elution Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 \u03bcM BMS-681, 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS, and 250 mM imidazole). PD MiniTrap G-25 columns (GE Healthcare) were used to remove imidazole. The protein was then treated overnight with His-tagged PreScission protease to cleave the C terminal His-tag and Flag-tag. PreScission protease and the cleaved C-terminal fragment were removed by binding to TALON IMAC resin for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The protein was collected as the TALON IMAC column flow-through. The protein was supplemented with 75 \u03bcM each of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[R] before being concentrated to 30mg/ml with a 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off Amicon centrifuge concentrator (Millipore). The estimated final compound concentrations were ~ 1\u20132 mM for both compounds. Protein stability assays The thermostability of CCR2-T4L was analyzed by a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay adapted from previous publications 33 using a RotorGene Q 6-plex RT-PCR machine (Qiagen). Briefly, 1\u20135 \u03bcg of protein was mixed with 3 \u03bcM 7-Diethylamino-3-(4\u2032-Maleimidylphenyl)-4-Methylcoumarin (CPM) dye (2.5 mM stock in DMSO) in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM, 0.004% CHS, 10% glycerol, and indicated concentrations of compounds to a final volume of 20 \u03bcL; samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then heated gradually from 28 \u00b0C to 90 \u00b0C at a rate of 0.8 \u00b0C/min, with CPM fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 460 nm) recorded every 1 \u00b0C. The melting temperature (Tm) was determined from the first derivative of the denaturation curve, using the Rotor-Gene Q \u2013 Pure Detection software (version 2.0.3). Crystallization Purified CCR2 in complex with BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] was reconstituted into lipidic cubic phase (LCP) by mixing with molten lipid using a mechanical syringe mixer 8 . The protein-LCP mixture contained 40% (w/w) receptor solution, 54% (w/w) monoolein and 6% (w/w) cholesterol. Crystallization trials were performed in 96-well glass sandwich plates (Hampton research) using a Mosquito LCP robot (TTP Labtech) by dispensing 45 nL of protein-laden LCP and 800 nL of precipitant solution per well. Plates were incubated and imaged at 20 \u00b0C. Initial crystal hits were found from a precipitant condition containing 100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 30% (v/v) PEG400, 100 mM Li 2 SO 4 . After optimization, diffraction quality crystals were obtained from 100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 30\u201332% (v/v) PEG400, 75\u201385 mM Li 2 SO 4 . Crystals usually grew to a maximum size of 60 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm in one week, and were harvested directly from the LCP matrix using MiTeGen micromounts and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and structure determination X-ray diffraction data were collected using a 10 \u03bcm collimated minibeam at a wavelength of 1.0332 \u00c5 with a Pilatus3 6M direct detector on the 23ID-D beamline (GM/CA CAT) of the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. Crystals were located and aligned by the rastering strategy 34 . Among the several hundred crystal samples screened, most crystals diffracted to 2.8\u20133.5 \u00c5 resolution when exposed to 0.3 s of unattenuated beam using 0.3\u00b0 oscillations. A 93.1% complete data set at 2.80 \u00c5 resolution was obtained by merging data from 17 crystals, using XDS 35 and Aimless 36 . As the data showed anisotropy, the UCLA Diffraction Anisotropy Server ( http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale/ ) was used to truncate the data to 3.0 \u00c5 along both a* and b* axes, and to 2.81 \u00c5 along the c* axis. Initial phase information was obtained by molecular replacement (MR) with the program Phaser 37 using the receptor portion of the CCR5 structure (PDB ID: 4MBS) converted to polyalanines, and the T4L portion of the CXCR4 structure (PDB ID: 3ODU) as search models. The correct MR solution (TFZ=14.8) contained one CCR2-T4L molecule in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was performed with Phenix 38 followed by manual examination and rebuilding of the refined coordinates in the program COOT 39 using both |2F o | - |F c | and |F o | - |F c | maps, as well as omit maps. The final model includes 295 residues (37 to 225 and 241\u2013319) of the 360 residues of CCR2 and residues 2 to 161 of T4L plus 16 residues of two 8-residue linkers. The remaining N- and C-terminal residues are disordered and were not built. Strong electron density for one metal ion was observed. The identity of the ion was determined to be Zn 2+ by X-ray fluorescence scans ( Extended Data Fig. 5 ). The zinc ion is coordinated by a water molecule as well as side chains of H144 3.56 , E238, and E1005. Data collection and refinement statistics is shown in Extended Data Table 1 . Crystallization and structure determination of BMS-681 BMS-681 was dissolved in a minimal amount of CH 3 CN and then 15% water was added. After standing overnight, the resulting crystals were harvested. Data were collected on a Bruker-AXS X8-Proteum Kappa goniometer and APEXII detector. Intensities were measured using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5) with the crystal kept at a constant temperature using an Oxford cryo system during data collection. Indexing and processing of the measured intensity data were carried out with the SAINT-APEX2 (Bruker-AXS) program suite, structure solution with SHELXS-97 and structure refinement with SHELXL-97. The derived atomic parameters (coordinates and temperature factors) were refined through full matrix least-squares. The function minimized in the refinements was \u03a3 w (|Fo| - |Fc|) 2 . R is defined as \u03a3 ||Fo| - |Fc||/\u03a3 |Fo| while R w = [\u03a3 w (|Fo| - |Fc|) 2 / \u03a3 w |Fo| 2 ] 1/2 where w is an appropriate weighting function based on errors in the observed intensities. Hydrogens were introduced in idealized positions with isotropic temperature factors, but no hydrogen parameters were varied. It should be noted that the refinement model illustrates significant disorder and partial occupancy factors of \u2018guest\u2019 solvent/water molecules within the crystalline lattice. The atomic positions of these disordered molecules were taken from the difference map analysis, which showed peaks of electron density of varying intensities at the refined positions representing the disordered solvent/water molecules. Data collection and refinement statistics is shown in Extended Data Table 2 . Cell culture and transfections Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (provided by Hans den Dulk, Leiden University, The Netherlands; originally obtained from and certified by ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium/F-12 Nutrient Mixture (DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin and 50\u03bcg/mL streptomycin; and maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2. Cells were subcultured twice a week at a ratio of 1:30 to 1:50 by trypsinization. Transient transfection of CHO cells with WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L constructs was performed using a polyethylenimine (PEI) method, as described previously 23 . Briefly, CHO cells were grown on 15 cm \u00f8 to around 50% confluence and then transfected with a DNA/PEI mixture containing 10 \u03bcg plasmid DNA \u2013 previously diluted in 150 mM NaCl solution \u2013 mixed with PEI solution (1 mg/mL) at a 1:6 DNA:PEI mass ratio. Before adding 1 mL of the transfection mixture to each plate, the culture medium of the cells was refreshed and the mixture incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 before membrane preparation. 24 h after transfection, sodium butyrate was added to each plate at a final concentration of 3 mM to increase receptor expression. CHO cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination before use, the outcome of which was negative. Membrane preparation Membranes from CHO cells transiently expressing the WT CCR2 or CCR2-T4L were prepared as described previously 23 . Briefly, cells were detached from 15-cm \u00f8 plates using 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000g. The membranes were separated from the cytosolic fractions by several centrifugation and homogenization steps. First, the pellets were resuspended and homogenized in ice-cold membrane buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, supplemented with 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.4) using an Ultra Thurrax Homogenizer (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG; Staufen, Germany). Homogenized membranes were then centrifuged in an Optima LE-80 K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 31,000g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The final membrane pellet was resuspended also in ice-cold membrane buffer and aliquoted before storage. Membrane aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and protein concentrations were measured using a standard BCA protein determination assay (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL USA). Radioligand binding assays [ 3 H]-INCB-3344 (specific activity 32 Ci mmol \u22121 ) and [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA (specific activity 63 Ci mmol \u22121 ) were custom-labeled by Vitrax (Placentia, CA). JNJ-27141491 was synthesized as described previously 40 . INCB-3344 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] were synthesized in-house as described previously 7 , 41 . All radioligand binding assays were performed at 25 \u00b0C in a 100 \u03bcL reaction volume containing assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% CHAPS) and 30 \u03bcg of membrane protein from CHO cells transiently expressing WT CCR2 or CCR2-T4L. For competition binding assays with [ 3 H]INCB-3344, a concentration of 5 nM [ 3 H]INCB-3344 was used, and non-specific binding was determined with 10 \u03bcM of unlabeled INCB-3344. In the case of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA competition binding assays, a radioligand concentration of 3 nM was used and non-specific binding was determined with 10 \u03bcM of JNJ-27141491. In all cases, homologous or competition displacement assays were carried out using six increasing concentrations of competing ligands. Kinetic experiments were also performed at 25 \u00b0C using 7 nM [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA and 30 \u03bcg of membrane protein in a 100 \u03bcL reaction volume. For association experiments, CHO-CCR2 or CHO-CCR2-T4L membranes were added to the reaction at 8 different time points, in the absence or presence of 1\u03bcM BMS-681. For dissociation experiments, membranes were first incubated with radioligand for 90 min, dissociation was then initiated by addition of 10 \u03bcM of CCR2-RA-[ R ] at 12 different time points, in the presence or absence of 1\u03bcM BMS-681. A higher number of time points were used in the dissociation assays, in order to characterize the biphasic profile of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA dissociation. In all cases, total radioligand binding did not exceed 10% of the total radioligand added to avoid ligand depletion. For all experiments, incubation was terminated by dilution with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% CHAPS). Separation of bound from free radioligand was achieved by rapid filtration over a 96-well GF/B filter plate using a Perkin Elmer Filtermate-harvester (Perkin Elmer, Groningen, the Netherlands) and filter-bound radioactivity was determined in a Perkin Elmer 2450 Microbeta2 plate counter after addition of 25 \u03bcL Microscint scintillation cocktail per well (Perkin-Elmer, Groningen, the Netherlands). Statistical Methods All radioligand binding data were analysed using Prism 6.0 and 7.0 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA, USA). The pIC 50 values were obtained by non-linear regression analysis of competition displacement assays. Apparent association rate constants ( k obs ) and maximum binding ( B max , used to calculate %B/B control ) were determined by fitting the association data to a one-phase exponential association function. Dissociation rate constants were determined by fitting the dissociation data to a monophasic ( k off ) or biphasic ( k off,fast and k off,slow ) exponential decay model. All data shown represent means \u00b1 S.E.M of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. An unpaired, two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was used to compare differences in pIC 50 as well as differences in kinetic parameters. Differences in binding enhancement (%Binding) in the absence (set at 100%) or presence of BMS-681 were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test. Significant differences are denoted as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 ****p < 0.0001. Data deposition statement The atomic coordinates and structure factors for CCR2:BMS-681:CCR2-RA-[ R ] complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 5T1A. The structure of free BMS-681 is deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) under accession number 1479580. Extended Data Extended Data Figure 1 CCR2-T4L crystals and crystal packing a\u2013c , Crystal packing of CCR2-T4L. CCR2 is a blue ribbon with ECL2 colored red and T4L yellow. The unit cell is shown as a green box. CCR2-T4L molecules are arranged in a type I packing with hydrophilic stacking mediated by T4L and T4L-ECL2 interactions along axis c. a , Crystal packing in the ac plane. CCR2 makes abundant hydrophobic contacts with its neighbor via an interface mediated by antiparallel helix IV\u2013helix VI interactions related by a screw axis along axis a. b , Crystal packing in the bc plane. Contacts between receptors and T4L involve ECL2 and the intracellular surface of CCR2 including helix VIII. Direct contacts between T4L are along axis b. One layer of CCR2-T4L molecules at the very top of the stacking column are omitted for clarity. c , Crystal packing in the ab plane. There are no direct interactions between T4L along axis a. d , Crystals of CCR2-T4L in the LCP bolus. Average crystals grew to 60 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm before harvesting. Extended Data Figure 2 BMS-681 binding may disrupt a chemokine-recognizing conformation of the CCR2 N-terminus and helix I a , Model of CCR2:CCL2 built by homology from the structure of CXCR4:vMIP-II 11 suggests that a productive chemokine-compatible conformation of the receptor requires re-orientation of the N-terminus from almost parallel to almost perpendicular to the membrane plane, and formation of an extra helical turn in helix I to bring it closer to helix VII and ECL3. b , Binding of BMS-681 may disrupt this chemokine-compatible conformation by inserting between helices I and VII. Extended Data Figure 3 CCR2-RA-[ R ] directly binds to CCR2 residues that are homologous to those involved in G protein coupling in other GPCRs Partial alignment of intracellular regions of CCR2 and homologous regions in bovine Rho (bRho) and \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR), alongside profile of contacts that CCR2-RA-[ R ], the G\u03b1 t C-terminal peptide 21 , and G\u03b1 s C-terminus 22 make with the three respective receptors. Contacts are shown by circles above and below the alignment, with circle area indicative of contact strength. Backbone and side-chain contacts are gray and black, respectively. Assuming structural homology between the CCR2:G protein interface and at least one of the bRho:G\u03b1 t and \u03b2 2 AR:G\u03b1 s interfaces, several residue positions appear to be involved in binding both CCR2-RA-[ R ] and the G protein C-terminus.

Figures represent normalized and combined data from three independent experiments performed in duplicate, with results presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M percentage of specific [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA binding. Extended Data Figure 5 A Zn 2+ binding site was identified by X-ray fluorescence emission (Xfe) analysis of the CCR2-T4L:BMS-681:CCR2-RA-[ R ] crystals a , View of the Zn 2+ ion at an interface formed by CCR2 helices III and VI and the N-terminus of T4L. The Zn 2+ ion is coordinated by side chains of H144 3.56 (from WT receptor), E238 6.30 (from the engineered part of the receptor), and E1005 (from T4L) as well as a structured water. b , The background fluorescence signal of an empty MiTeGen micromount is low, indicating the absence of metal ion. Excitation at 12 keV results in a peak at 11.7 keV (due to the incidence beam). c , Xfe signal from a wide fluorescence scan of the CCR2-T4L crystal. The fluorescence peaks at 8.60 keV and 9.53 keV correspond to X-ray emission lines K \u03b1 (8.64 keV) and K \u03b2 (9.57 keV) and indicate the presence of Zn 2+ bound to CCR2-T4L. d , A zoomed-in view of the Xfe signal from ( c ).

CCR2 is expressed on monocytes, immature dendritic cells and T cell subpopulations, and mediates their migration towards endogenous CC chemokine ligands such as CCL2 1 . CCR2 and its ligands are implicated in numerous inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases 2 including atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, neuropathic pain, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as cancer 3 . These disease associations have motivated numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials 4 (see ClinicalTrials.gov) in search of therapies that target the CCR2:chemokine axis. To aid drug discovery efforts 5 , we solved a structure of CCR2 in a ternary complex with an orthosteric (BMS-681 6 ) and allosteric (CCR2-RA-[ R ] 7 ) antagonist. BMS-681 inhibits chemokine binding by occupying the orthosteric pocket of the receptor in a previously unseen binding mode. CCR2-RA-[ R ] binds in a novel, highly druggable pocket that is the most intracellular allosteric site observed in Class A GPCRs to date; this site spatially overlaps the G protein-binding site in homologous receptors. CCR2-RA-[ R ] inhibits CCR2 non-competitively by blocking activation-associated conformational changes and formation of the G protein-binding interface. The conformational signature of the conserved microswitch residues observed in double-antagonist-bound CCR2 resembles the most inactive GPCR structures solved to date. Like other protein:protein interactions, receptor:chemokine complexes are considered challenging therapeutic targets for small molecules, and the present structure suggests diverse pocket epitopes that can be exploited to overcome drug design obstacles. Main A ternary complex between an engineered construct of human CCR2 isoform b (further referred to as CCR2-T4L or simply CCR2), an orthosteric antagonist BMS-681 (compound 13d in 6 ), and an allosteric antagonist CCR2-RA-[ R ] 7 was crystallized using the lipidic cubic phase method 8 , and the structure was determined to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution ( Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Simultaneous addition of two compounds dramatically stabilized detergent-solubilized CCR2-T4L in comparison with twice the concentration of each compound individually ( Fig. 1a ), suggesting concurrent binding of CCR2-RA-[ R ] and BMS-681 to the receptor. The presence of both compounds was critical for crystallization. In the structure, CCR2 adopts the canonical fold of class A GPCRs with seven transmembrane (TM) helices connected by three extracellular (EC) and three intracellular (IC) loops ( Fig. 1b ). Both compounds are visible ( Fig. 1b\u2013d ); BMS-681 binds in the extracellular orthosteric pocket ( Fig. 1b, c ) while CCR2-RA-[ R ] is located more than 30\u00c5 away ( Fig. 1b, d ), in a site that is the most intracellular allosteric pocket observed in Class A GPCRs to date ( Fig 1e ). The binding site of CCR2-RA-[ R ] spatially overlaps with the G protein-binding site in homologous receptors ( Fig 1f ). As for other chemokine receptors 9 \u2013 12 , CCR2 is expected to have two conserved disulfide bonds in its extracellular domains, with Cys32-Cys277 connecting the N-terminus (NT) to ECL3, and Cys113-Cys190 connecting TM3 to ECL2. Electron density is apparent for the ECL2-TM3 disulfide bond but not for the NT residues 1\u201336 or the NT-ECL3 disulfide bond ( Fig. 1b, c ). Because the NT-ECL3 disulfide bond has been shown important for CCR2 signaling 13 , its absence is unlikely to be an inherent feature of the receptor; instead, it might be caused by strain of the bond in the ligand-bound state of the receptor 14 , possibly exacerbated by solvent exposure and radiation damage of the crystals 15 . As with other chemokine receptors, the extracellular orthosteric pocket of CCR2 can be divided into a major and a minor subpocket, defined by helices III\u2013VII and helices I\u2013III, VII, respectively, and separated by residues Y120 3.32 and E291 7.39 (superscript indicates residue number as per Ballesteros-Weinstein nomenclature). BMS-681 binds predominantly in the minor subpocket ( Fig. 2a,b ) and buries 366.3 \u00c5 2 of surface area. The 6-trifluoromethyl quinazoline moiety protrudes between helices I and VII towards the lipid bilayer, while the tri-substituted cyclohexane packs against W98 2.60 . The \u03b3-lactam secondary exocyclic amine forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of T292 7.40 , which is critical for binding of chemically related compounds such as BMS-558 (compound 22 in 16 ) and the Teijin lead series 17 , 18 . This amine is also within hydrogen bonding distance from the backbone carbonyl of Q288 7.36 . The carbonyl oxygen of the \u03b3-lactam forms a hydrogen bond with Y49 1.39 , which itself is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of T292 7.40 . The N1 nitrogen of the quinazoline is within 4 \u00c5 of the Q288 7.36 side chain. The protonated tertiary amine on the cyclohexane ring is proximal to a structured water molecule in the binding site. Some CCR2 antagonists, particularly those containing a basic amine, are known to depend on the conserved E291 7.39 in the receptor 19 ; however, no direct interaction is observed between E291 7.39 and BMS-681. The receptor-bound, bioactive conformation of BMS-681 is strikingly similar to the crystallographic conformation of free BMS-681 ( Fig. 2c , Extended Data Table 2 ) suggesting the absence of internal strain in the bound state. BMS-681 engages several residues that are critical for CCL2 binding and/or activation of CCR2 17 , 18 including Y49 1.39 , W98 2.60 , Y120 3.32 , and T292 7.40 . Thus, it seems to directly compete with chemokine binding to the orthosteric pocket. Additionally, by inserting between helices I and VII, BMS-681 may put strain onto residues C32-V37 connecting TM1 to ECL3, destabilize the conserved NT-ECL3 disulfide bond (absent in the structure), and prevent the N-terminus and TM1 from adopting a productive chemokine binding conformation observed in homologous receptor:chemokine structures 11 , 12 ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). On the opposite side of the receptor, CCR2-RA-[ R ] is caged by the intracellular ends of helices I\u2013III and VI\u2013VIII and buries 297.8 \u00c5 2 of surface area. The inner hydrophobic part of the cage is made by V63 1.53 , L67 1.57 , L81 2.43 , L134 3.46 , A241 6.33 , V244 6.36 , I245 6.37 , Y305 7.53 , and F312 8.50 , while the outer (cytosol-facing) polar part consists of T77 2.39 , R138 3.50 , G309 8.47 , K311 8.49 , and Y315 8.53 ( Fig. 2d, e ), as well as the backbones of engineered R237 6.29 and K240 6.32 . The binding pocket of CCR2-RA-[ R ] is highly enclosed and possesses a balanced combination of hydrophobic and polar features, all of which favors pocket \u201cdruggability\u201d 5 . Owing to the lack of a side-chain on G309 8.47 , the hydroxyl and pyrrolone carbonyl groups of CCR2-RA-[ R ] can hydrogen-bond to the exposed backbone amides of E310 8.48 , K311 8.49 , and F312 8.50 ( Fig. 2d, e ). The acetyl group of the compound resides near the terminal amine of K311 8.49 . The critical roles of V244 6.36 , Y305 7.53 , K311 8.49 , and F312 8.50 in CCR2-RA-[ R ] binding were established by an earlier mutagenesis study 20 . Because homologs of several residues in the CCR2-RA-[ R ] binding pocket directly couple to the G protein in bovine rhodopsin 21 and the \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR) 22 structures ( Extended Data Fig. 3 ), CCR2-RA-[ R ] appears to sterically interfere with G protein binding to CCR2. The structure suggests an interesting symmetric mechanism for the concurrent antagonistic action of the two compounds. BMS-681 interferes with chemokine binding directly and with G protein coupling indirectly, by stabilizing an inactive, presumably G protein-incompatible 6 conformation of the receptor. Conversely, CCR2-RA-[ R ] directly prevents G protein coupling and allosterically inhibits binding of the CCL2 chemokine 23 , which, like most GPCR agonists, requires an active, G protein-associated receptor for high affinity binding 23 . Bi-directional allosteric communication between the extra- and intracellular sides of the receptor is reminiscent of that previously observed in adenosine A 2A receptor (AA 2A R) 24 and \u03b2 2 AR 25 using allosteric inverse agonist antibodies/nanobodies that target the same epitope as CCR2-RA-[ R ]. Similar to these antibodies, CCR2-RA-[ R ] was previously shown to allosterically enhance, and to be allosterically enhanced by, binding of orthosteric antagonists 23 , i.e. to demonstrate positive binding cooperativity. We further characterized this cooperativity by studying the binding of BMS-681 to WT CCR2 and the crystallization construct CCR2-T4L using previously characterized radioactive probes [ 3 H]-INCB-3344 23 (orthosteric) and [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA (allosteric). In equilibrium competition binding assays on WT CCR2, both INCB-3344 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] displaced their homologous radioligand with IC 50 values of 17 and 13 nM, respectively ( Extended Data Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Table 3 ), comparable to previously reported values 23 . Compared to WT CCR2, the affinity of both antagonists towards CCR2-T4L was improved by approximately 2-fold, suggesting a slight engineering-related shift towards the inactive state. BMS-681 fully displaced [ 3 H]-INCB-3344 with nanomolar affinities for both constructs, but did not displace [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA. Instead, at 1 \u03bcM concentration it enhanced the binding of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA by >30% ( Extended Data Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Table 3 ). In kinetic radioligand experiments, the presence of BMS-681 also increased total binding of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA to both WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L, with the increase as high as 62% in the case of CCR2-T4L ( Extended Data Fig. 4c\u2013d , and Extended Data Table 4 ). 1\u03bcM BMS-681 decreased the dissociation rate constant of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA, while producing a slight increase (WT CCR2) or no change (CCR2-T4L) in the observed association rate constants. Moreover, in CCR2-T4L, the presence of BMS-681 changed the biphasic dissociation profile of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA to monophasic, suggesting stabilization of the receptor population in a homogenous conformational state ( Extended Data Table 4 ). Along with the stability and equilibrium binding data, these results further corroborate the hypothesis that BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] cooperatively stabilize a preferred inactive conformation of CCR2-T4L. We next analyzed the structure of double-antagonist-bound CCR2-T4L to better understand this conformation. The plethora of existing class A GPCR structures suggests a conserved conformational signature of an active receptor state 26 . This signature involves separation between the intracellular end of helix VI and the rest of the TM bundle, an inward repositioning and rotation of helix VII, and concerted repacking of the highly conserved microswitches R 3.50 (of the DR 3.50 Y motif), Y 5.58 , and Y 7.53 (of the NPxxY 7.53 motif) ( Fig. 3a, b ) to form an intracellular binding interface for G protein. Furthermore, rather than adopting either an \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d state, receptors can occupy an ensemble of intermediate conformations 27 . The active state signature is fully represented in US28, the only agonist-bound chemokine receptor crystallized to date 12 ( Fig. 3a\u2013c ). By contrast, the double-antagonist-bound CCR2 structure appears to occupy the opposite end of the activation spectrum as it shares the conformational microswitch signatures of the most inactive GPCR structures observed thus far ( Fig. 3a\u2013e ). As in the inactive CCR5:Maraviroc complex 10 , the intracellular ends of CCR2 helices III and VI are close together, and the conserved R 3.50 interacts with D 3.49 and T 2.39 , effectively disrupting the G protein binding pocket ( Fig. 3b, d, e ). Similarly, in both CCR2 and CCR5 structures, the intracellular end of helix VII is in the inactive outward-facing conformation with Y 7.53 pointing towards helix II rather than the center of the bundle. However, in CCR5, Y 5.58 is oriented towards the center of the bundle, whereas in the present CCR2 structure, it faces the lipid and is sterically blocked from approaching R 3.50 and Y 7.53 by F 6.38 ( Fig. 3d, e ). The net result of these interactions is that the crystallographically observed conformation of CCR2 appears to be even more inactive than that of CCR5 and most similar to dark rhodopsin 28 and Fab-bound \u03b2 2 AR 29 . Although receptor construct engineering appears to contribute to stabilization of this inactive state, the ligand binding and thermal denaturation data suggest that the concerted action of the two antagonists is also important. By directly interacting with the conserved activation microswitch residues, CCR2-RA-[ R ] is perfectly positioned to stabilize this inactive state: it sterically blocks Y 7.53 from populating the active conformation and is propped against R 3.50 , restricting its orientation away from the G protein interface ( Fig. 3b ). Although located 30 \u00c5 away, BMS-681 appears to cooperate with CCR2-RA-[ R ] through their common interactions with helix VII, which moves outward on the intracellular side (opposite to its movement during activation) and inward on the extracellular side (relative to CCR5 and US28) ( Fig. 3f ). The CCR2 structure has general implications for the design of drugs targeting chemokine receptors as a family. As with most protein:protein interfaces, the orthosteric binding pockets of chemokine receptors are large, wide open, and highly polar. Chemokines explore numerous hotspots within these pockets and their binding is additionally reinforced by the interaction with the flexible N-termini of the receptors 11 , 12 ( Fig. 4a ), collectively making for an extensive and versatile interaction that is conceptually difficult to inhibit with small molecules. The CCR2:BMS-681:CCR2-RA-[ R ] structure extends the repertoire of ideas that can be employed to overcome these obstacles. The binding mode of BMS-681 ( Fig. 4b ) contrasts with both the binding mode of Maraviroc to CCR5 ( Fig. 4c ) where the ligand spans the major and the minor subpocket of the receptor, and that of IT1t to CXCR4 ( Fig. 4d ) where the ligand is entirely accommodated in the minor subpocket. While occupying the minor subpocket of CCR2, BMS-681 protrudes between helices I and VII towards the lipid bilayer ( Fig. 4b ) in an interaction facilitated by the trifluoromethyl group that is often present in CCR2 antagonists 30 . This interaction enables hydrophobic anchoring of BMS-681 to the otherwise polar and open binding site of CCR2; by doing so, it parallels the role of other unique non-polar subpockets exploited by crystallized small molecule antagonists of CCR5 and CXCR4 ( Fig. 4b\u2013d ). The novel subpocket explored by BMS-681 may have an additional advantage of disrupting the chemokine-compatible conformation of the receptor N-terminus ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). CCR2-RA-[ R ] demonstrates a previously unseen binding mode within an allosteric pocket on the intracellular side of CCR2. Although relatively small, this pocket has a desirable balance of polarity and hydrophobicity ( Fig. 2e and 4e ). Homologous pockets may be present in other chemokine receptors, owing to a conserved G 8.47 ; in fact, compound binding in homologous regions has been indirectly demonstrated for CCR1 and CCR5, and directly for CCR4 31 , CXCR1, and CXCR2 32 . In most other receptors that have been crystallized thus far, the non-glycine residue at position 8.47 appears to both reduce the pocket volume and block access to the backbone amides of helix 8; consequently, the homologous pockets in these receptors may not be druggable although negative allosteric modulation with antibodies and nanobodies targeting the same region has been reported 24 , 25 . By simultaneously competing with G protein and blocking activation-related conformational changes, compound binding in the allosteric pocket appears a powerful way to antagonize the receptor. Therefore, for those receptors in which the allosteric pocket is druggable, targeting it with small molecules may open new avenues for GPCR drug discovery. Methods Design and Expression of CCR2-T4L fusion constructs The sequence of human CCR2 isoform b (Uniprot ID P41597-2) was engineered for crystallization by truncation of C-terminal residues 329\u2013360 and by grafting T4 lysozyme (T4L) into the ICL3. In the process of construct optimization, the native CCR2 residues between L226 5.62 and R240 6.32 (L226 5.62 -KTLLRCRNEKKRH-R240 6.32 ) were removed and replaced with corresponding residues from the crystallized structure of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (PDB ID 3UON, resulting amino-acid sequence S226 5.62 -RASKSRI-T4L-PPPSREK-K240 6.32 ). The presence of T4L in ICL3 is expected to prevent receptor activation; however the similar affinities of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] for both WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L ( Extended Data Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Table 3 ) suggest that the fusion construct is a good surrogate of WT CCR2 for understanding ligand recognition. The CCR2-T4L coding sequence was cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) with an HA signal sequence followed by a FLAG tag at the N-terminus and a PreScission protease site followed by a 10xHis tag and another FLAG tag at the C-terminus. The receptor was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf9 ) cells. High-titer recombinant baculovirus (>10 9 viral particles per ml) was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) as previously described 11 . Sf9 cells at a cell density of 2\u20133 \u00d7 10 6 cells ml \u22121 were infected with P1 virus at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 48 h post-infection and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Purification of CCR2-T4L Insect cell membranes were prepared by thawing frozen cell pellets in a hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Extensive washing of the raw membranes was performed by repeated douncing and centrifugation in the same hypotonic buffer (2\u20133 times) and then in a high osmotic buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (3\u20134 times), thereby separating soluble and membrane associated proteins from integral transmembrane proteins. 40 mM stock solutions of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] were made in isopropanol. Washed membranes were resuspended into a buffer containing 50 \u03bcM BMS-681, 2 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h before solubilization. The membranes were then solubilized in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl- \u03b2 -D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 0.2% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS, Sigma) at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h. The supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 50,000g for 30 min, and incubated in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl with TALON IMAC resin (Clontech) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After binding, the resin was washed without addition of ligands with 10 column volumes of Wash I Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) DDM, 0.02% (w/v) CHS, 10 mM imidazole), followed by 4 column volumes of Wash II Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS, 50mM imidazole). The protein was then eluted with 3\u20134 column volumes of Elution Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 \u03bcM BMS-681, 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS, and 250 mM imidazole). PD MiniTrap G-25 columns (GE Healthcare) were used to remove imidazole. The protein was then treated overnight with His-tagged PreScission protease to cleave the C terminal His-tag and Flag-tag. PreScission protease and the cleaved C-terminal fragment were removed by binding to TALON IMAC resin for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The protein was collected as the TALON IMAC column flow-through. The protein was supplemented with 75 \u03bcM each of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[R] before being concentrated to 30mg/ml with a 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off Amicon centrifuge concentrator (Millipore). The estimated final compound concentrations were ~ 1\u20132 mM for both compounds. Protein stability assays The thermostability of CCR2-T4L was analyzed by a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay adapted from previous publications 33 using a RotorGene Q 6-plex RT-PCR machine (Qiagen). Briefly, 1\u20135 \u03bcg of protein was mixed with 3 \u03bcM 7-Diethylamino-3-(4\u2032-Maleimidylphenyl)-4-Methylcoumarin (CPM) dye (2.5 mM stock in DMSO) in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM, 0.004% CHS, 10% glycerol, and indicated concentrations of compounds to a final volume of 20 \u03bcL; samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then heated gradually from 28 \u00b0C to 90 \u00b0C at a rate of 0.8 \u00b0C/min, with CPM fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 460 nm) recorded every 1 \u00b0C. The melting temperature (Tm) was determined from the first derivative of the denaturation curve, using the Rotor-Gene Q \u2013 Pure Detection software (version 2.0.3). Crystallization Purified CCR2 in complex with BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] was reconstituted into lipidic cubic phase (LCP) by mixing with molten lipid using a mechanical syringe mixer 8 . The protein-LCP mixture contained 40% (w/w) receptor solution, 54% (w/w) monoolein and 6% (w/w) cholesterol. Crystallization trials were performed in 96-well glass sandwich plates (Hampton research) using a Mosquito LCP robot (TTP Labtech) by dispensing 45 nL of protein-laden LCP and 800 nL of precipitant solution per well. Plates were incubated and imaged at 20 \u00b0C. Initial crystal hits were found from a precipitant condition containing 100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 30% (v/v) PEG400, 100 mM Li 2 SO 4 . After optimization, diffraction quality crystals were obtained from 100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 30\u201332% (v/v) PEG400, 75\u201385 mM Li 2 SO 4 . Crystals usually grew to a maximum size of 60 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm in one week, and were harvested directly from the LCP matrix using MiTeGen micromounts and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and structure determination X-ray diffraction data were collected using a 10 \u03bcm collimated minibeam at a wavelength of 1.0332 \u00c5 with a Pilatus3 6M direct detector on the 23ID-D beamline (GM/CA CAT) of the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. Crystals were located and aligned by the rastering strategy 34 . Among the several hundred crystal samples screened, most crystals diffracted to 2.8\u20133.5 \u00c5 resolution when exposed to 0.3 s of unattenuated beam using 0.3\u00b0 oscillations. A 93.1% complete data set at 2.80 \u00c5 resolution was obtained by merging data from 17 crystals, using XDS 35 and Aimless 36 . As the data showed anisotropy, the UCLA Diffraction Anisotropy Server ( http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale/ ) was used to truncate the data to 3.0 \u00c5 along both a* and b* axes, and to 2.81 \u00c5 along the c* axis. Initial phase information was obtained by molecular replacement (MR) with the program Phaser 37 using the receptor portion of the CCR5 structure (PDB ID: 4MBS) converted to polyalanines, and the T4L portion of the CXCR4 structure (PDB ID: 3ODU) as search models. The correct MR solution (TFZ=14.8) contained one CCR2-T4L molecule in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was performed with Phenix 38 followed by manual examination and rebuilding of the refined coordinates in the program COOT 39 using both |2F o | - |F c | and |F o | - |F c | maps, as well as omit maps. The final model includes 295 residues (37 to 225 and 241\u2013319) of the 360 residues of CCR2 and residues 2 to 161 of T4L plus 16 residues of two 8-residue linkers. The remaining N- and C-terminal residues are disordered and were not built. Strong electron density for one metal ion was observed. The identity of the ion was determined to be Zn 2+ by X-ray fluorescence scans ( Extended Data Fig. 5 ). The zinc ion is coordinated by a water molecule as well as side chains of H144 3.56 , E238, and E1005. Data collection and refinement statistics is shown in Extended Data Table 1 . Crystallization and structure determination of BMS-681 BMS-681 was dissolved in a minimal amount of CH 3 CN and then 15% water was added. After standing overnight, the resulting crystals were harvested. Data were collected on a Bruker-AXS X8-Proteum Kappa goniometer and APEXII detector. Intensities were measured using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5) with the crystal kept at a constant temperature using an Oxford cryo system during data collection. Indexing and processing of the measured intensity data were carried out with the SAINT-APEX2 (Bruker-AXS) program suite, structure solution with SHELXS-97 and structure refinement with SHELXL-97. The derived atomic parameters (coordinates and temperature factors) were refined through full matrix least-squares. The function minimized in the refinements was \u03a3 w (|Fo| - |Fc|) 2 . R is defined as \u03a3 ||Fo| - |Fc||/\u03a3 |Fo| while R w = [\u03a3 w (|Fo| - |Fc|) 2 / \u03a3 w |Fo| 2 ] 1/2 where w is an appropriate weighting function based on errors in the observed intensities. Hydrogens were introduced in idealized positions with isotropic temperature factors, but no hydrogen parameters were varied. It should be noted that the refinement model illustrates significant disorder and partial occupancy factors of \u2018guest\u2019 solvent/water molecules within the crystalline lattice. The atomic positions of these disordered molecules were taken from the difference map analysis, which showed peaks of electron density of varying intensities at the refined positions representing the disordered solvent/water molecules. Data collection and refinement statistics is shown in Extended Data Table 2 . Cell culture and transfections Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (provided by Hans den Dulk, Leiden University, The Netherlands; originally obtained from and certified by ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium/F-12 Nutrient Mixture (DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin and 50\u03bcg/mL streptomycin; and maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2. Cells were subcultured twice a week at a ratio of 1:30 to 1:50 by trypsinization. Transient transfection of CHO cells with WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L constructs was performed using a polyethylenimine (PEI) method, as described previously 23 . Briefly, CHO cells were grown on 15 cm \u00f8 to around 50% confluence and then transfected with a DNA/PEI mixture containing 10 \u03bcg plasmid DNA \u2013 previously diluted in 150 mM NaCl solution \u2013 mixed with PEI solution (1 mg/mL) at a 1:6 DNA:PEI mass ratio. Before adding 1 mL of the transfection mixture to each plate, the culture medium of the cells was refreshed and the mixture incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 before membrane preparation. 24 h after transfection, sodium butyrate was added to each plate at a final concentration of 3 mM to increase receptor expression. CHO cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination before use, the outcome of which was negative. Membrane preparation Membranes from CHO cells transiently expressing the WT CCR2 or CCR2-T4L were prepared as described previously 23 . Briefly, cells were detached from 15-cm \u00f8 plates using 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000g. The membranes were separated from the cytosolic fractions by several centrifugation and homogenization steps. First, the pellets were resuspended and homogenized in ice-cold membrane buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, supplemented with 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.4) using an Ultra Thurrax Homogenizer (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG; Staufen, Germany). Homogenized membranes were then centrifuged in an Optima LE-80 K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 31,000g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The final membrane pellet was resuspended also in ice-cold membrane buffer and aliquoted before storage. Membrane aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and protein concentrations were measured using a standard BCA protein determination assay (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL USA). Radioligand binding assays [ 3 H]-INCB-3344 (specific activity 32 Ci mmol \u22121 ) and [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA (specific activity 63 Ci mmol \u22121 ) were custom-labeled by Vitrax (Placentia, CA). JNJ-27141491 was synthesized as described previously 40 . INCB-3344 and CCR2-RA-[ R ] were synthesized in-house as described previously 7 , 41 . All radioligand binding assays were performed at 25 \u00b0C in a 100 \u03bcL reaction volume containing assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% CHAPS) and 30 \u03bcg of membrane protein from CHO cells transiently expressing WT CCR2 or CCR2-T4L. For competition binding assays with [ 3 H]INCB-3344, a concentration of 5 nM [ 3 H]INCB-3344 was used, and non-specific binding was determined with 10 \u03bcM of unlabeled INCB-3344. In the case of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA competition binding assays, a radioligand concentration of 3 nM was used and non-specific binding was determined with 10 \u03bcM of JNJ-27141491. In all cases, homologous or competition displacement assays were carried out using six increasing concentrations of competing ligands. Kinetic experiments were also performed at 25 \u00b0C using 7 nM [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA and 30 \u03bcg of membrane protein in a 100 \u03bcL reaction volume. For association experiments, CHO-CCR2 or CHO-CCR2-T4L membranes were added to the reaction at 8 different time points, in the absence or presence of 1\u03bcM BMS-681. For dissociation experiments, membranes were first incubated with radioligand for 90 min, dissociation was then initiated by addition of 10 \u03bcM of CCR2-RA-[ R ] at 12 different time points, in the presence or absence of 1\u03bcM BMS-681. A higher number of time points were used in the dissociation assays, in order to characterize the biphasic profile of [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA dissociation. In all cases, total radioligand binding did not exceed 10% of the total radioligand added to avoid ligand depletion. For all experiments, incubation was terminated by dilution with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% CHAPS). Separation of bound from free radioligand was achieved by rapid filtration over a 96-well GF/B filter plate using a Perkin Elmer Filtermate-harvester (Perkin Elmer, Groningen, the Netherlands) and filter-bound radioactivity was determined in a Perkin Elmer 2450 Microbeta2 plate counter after addition of 25 \u03bcL Microscint scintillation cocktail per well (Perkin-Elmer, Groningen, the Netherlands). Statistical Methods All radioligand binding data were analysed using Prism 6.0 and 7.0 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA, USA). The pIC 50 values were obtained by non-linear regression analysis of competition displacement assays. Apparent association rate constants ( k obs ) and maximum binding ( B max , used to calculate %B/B control ) were determined by fitting the association data to a one-phase exponential association function. Dissociation rate constants were determined by fitting the dissociation data to a monophasic ( k off ) or biphasic ( k off,fast and k off,slow ) exponential decay model. All data shown represent means \u00b1 S.E.M of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. An unpaired, two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was used to compare differences in pIC 50 as well as differences in kinetic parameters. Differences in binding enhancement (%Binding) in the absence (set at 100%) or presence of BMS-681 were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test. Significant differences are denoted as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 ****p < 0.0001.

The structure of free BMS-681 is deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) under accession number 1479580. Extended Data Extended Data Figure 1 CCR2-T4L crystals and crystal packing a\u2013c , Crystal packing of CCR2-T4L. CCR2 is a blue ribbon with ECL2 colored red and T4L yellow. The unit cell is shown as a green box. CCR2-T4L molecules are arranged in a type I packing with hydrophilic stacking mediated by T4L and T4L-ECL2 interactions along axis c. a , Crystal packing in the ac plane. CCR2 makes abundant hydrophobic contacts with its neighbor via an interface mediated by antiparallel helix IV\u2013helix VI interactions related by a screw axis along axis a. b , Crystal packing in the bc plane. Contacts between receptors and T4L involve ECL2 and the intracellular surface of CCR2 including helix VIII. Direct contacts between T4L are along axis b. One layer of CCR2-T4L molecules at the very top of the stacking column are omitted for clarity. c , Crystal packing in the ab plane. There are no direct interactions between T4L along axis a. d , Crystals of CCR2-T4L in the LCP bolus. Average crystals grew to 60 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm before harvesting. Extended Data Figure 2 BMS-681 binding may disrupt a chemokine-recognizing conformation of the CCR2 N-terminus and helix I a , Model of CCR2:CCL2 built by homology from the structure of CXCR4:vMIP-II 11 suggests that a productive chemokine-compatible conformation of the receptor requires re-orientation of the N-terminus from almost parallel to almost perpendicular to the membrane plane, and formation of an extra helical turn in helix I to bring it closer to helix VII and ECL3. b , Binding of BMS-681 may disrupt this chemokine-compatible conformation by inserting between helices I and VII. Extended Data Figure 3 CCR2-RA-[ R ] directly binds to CCR2 residues that are homologous to those involved in G protein coupling in other GPCRs Partial alignment of intracellular regions of CCR2 and homologous regions in bovine Rho (bRho) and \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR), alongside profile of contacts that CCR2-RA-[ R ], the G\u03b1 t C-terminal peptide 21 , and G\u03b1 s C-terminus 22 make with the three respective receptors. Contacts are shown by circles above and below the alignment, with circle area indicative of contact strength. Backbone and side-chain contacts are gray and black, respectively. Assuming structural homology between the CCR2:G protein interface and at least one of the bRho:G\u03b1 t and \u03b2 2 AR:G\u03b1 s interfaces, several residue positions appear to be involved in binding both CCR2-RA-[ R ] and the G protein C-terminus.

Figures represent normalized and combined data from three independent experiments performed in duplicate, with results presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M percentage of specific [ 3 H]-CCR2-RA binding.

The fluorescence peaks at 8.60 keV and 9.53 keV correspond to X-ray emission lines K \u03b1 (8.64 keV) and K \u03b2 (9.57 keV) and indicate the presence of Zn 2+ bound to CCR2-T4L. d , A zoomed-in view of the Xfe signal from ( c ).
