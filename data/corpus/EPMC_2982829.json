    "abstract_text": "Type beta transforming growth factor (beta TGF) purified from human platelets to homogeneity as judged by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis has been labeled with 125I to characterize its interaction with cellular receptors. Binding of 125I-beta TGF to target cells is temperature- and time-dependent, specific, saturable, and reversible. About 1.6-1.9 X 10(4) binding sites/cell with high affinity for beta TGF (Kd = 5.6-7.8 X 10(-11) M and 9.1-14 X 10(-11) M, respectively) are found in NRK-49F and BALB/c 3T3 cells. beta TGF receptors do not appear to undergo acute down-regulation by the ligand. Specific binding of 125I-beta TGF has been observed in several human, rat, and mouse fibroblast lines and in some, but not all, tumor-derived cell lines examined. 125I-beta TGF has been cross-linked to intact cells and isolated membrane preparations using disuccinimidyl suberate. Cells and isolated membranes from human, rat, and mouse origin affinity labeled with 125I-beta TGF exhibit a major labeled species of approximately 280 kilodaltons that has the properties of high affinity and specificity expected from a physiologically relevant beta TGF receptor. Minor labeled species of 70-90 kilodaltons are also labeled by 125I-beta TGF, but they correspond to molecular species with low apparent affinity (Kd approximately 10(-8) M) for 125I-beta TGF.",
