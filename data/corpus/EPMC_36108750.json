    "abstract_text": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) drives the formation of extensive membrane-less compartments to regulate various cellular biological activities both physiologically and pathologically. It has been widely accepted that LLPS is closely related to amyloid diseases and increasing reports have linked this phenomenon to cancers. Mutations of tumor suppressor protein p53 exist in more than half of malignant tumors, making the protein vitally important in cancer research. Recently, p53 was reported to undergo phase separation, which may regulate the function of p53. The molecular mechanism of p53 phase separation and how this process relates to cancer remains largely unclear. Herein, we find that the disordered unstructured basic region (UBR) plays a crucial role in p53 LLPS, driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Mutations in the tetramerization domain (TD) disrupt p53 phase separation by preventing the tetramer formation. Furthermore, our results have revealed that, in response to DNA damage in cell, the wild type (WT) p53 undergoes LLPS, while LLPS in oncogenic mutations is diminished or eliminated. The expression of the target gene of p53 decreased significantly with the mutations and cell survival increased with the mutations. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism of p53 carcinogenesis, whereby oncogenic mutations in TD impair the formation of p53 condensates, decreasing the activation of target genes and promoting cancer progression. This study helps to understand the behavior and function of p53 in a different aspect and may provide insights into cancer therapies targeting p53.",
