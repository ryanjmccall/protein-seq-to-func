    "abstract_text": "A major advance in the understanding of the control of appetite, food intake, and energy expenditure came with the discovery of leptin. Leptin concentrations correlate with adipose tissue mass, and leptin acts via the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. A variety of different neurotransmitters have been implicated in mediating the CNS effects of leptin. In humans, leptin deficiency is unlikely to be a major cause of obesity. Most humans are not leptin deficient, but have a leptin concentration raised in proportion to their fat mass. A recent clinical trial looking at the use of recombinant leptin in treating human obesity has resulted in only variable amounts of weight loss. The role of leptin extends beyond the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin reverses many of the physiological responses to starvation. It is suggested that the main role of leptin might be in response to food deprivation and not in obesity.",
