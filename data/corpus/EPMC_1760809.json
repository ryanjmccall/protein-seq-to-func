    "abstract_text": "In this work a new monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated MGR1, which recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) binding site, is described. The main characteristic of this mAb is its ability to discriminate between cells that express normal levels of EGF-R from cells with overexpression, the detectability threshold by immunocytochemical tests being 5 x 10(4) receptors/cell of 10 microns diameter. MGR1 was found to inhibit EGF binding on the relevant target cells, and vice versa its binding was inhibited by EGF, which indicated that MGR1 recognizes the EGF receptor binding site. MGR1 exerted an inhibitory effect on both the in vitro and in vivo growth of cells with EGF-R overexpression, but had no effect on cells with a normal expression of the receptor. Tumour growth inhibition in athymic mice was also obtained on already implanted tumours. MGR1 therefore seems to be an adequate reagent for the development of immunotherapeutical approaches suitable for the treatment of tumours with EGF-R overexpression.",
