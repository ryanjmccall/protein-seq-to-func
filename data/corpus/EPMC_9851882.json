  "abstract_text": "We report the cloning of two variant genes encoding the CII-3 subunit of succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex II. One gene is located within intron 10 of the human sulfonylurea receptor gene. The 3' boundary of this gene ends in a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat. The second gene CII-3b is expressed at a low level and contains a 102-bp internal deletion compared to CII-3 cDNA. These genes should prove valuable in the characterization of Complex II disorders.",
