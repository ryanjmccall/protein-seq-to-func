  "abstract_text": "To identify genes involved in cell growth and/or apoptosis in leukemia, differential display was used to identify mRNAs that showed altered expression levels after cytokine withdrawal from the cytokine-dependent MO7e cell line. Sequence analysis of one transcript that showed a profound decrease in expression after cytokine withdrawal revealed it to be a member of the SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling ATPases. This cDNA had a 2514-nucleotide (838-amino acid) open reading frame and encoded an additional 230 amino acids at the NH2 terminus compared with the murine homologue, lsh, and the human counterpart, Hells. This gene locus has been designated SMARCA6 (SWI/SNF2-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 6). The highest levels of mRNA expression in humans are observed in proliferative tissues such as the thymus, testis, and bone marrow. Whereas cytokine withdrawal in MO7e cells leads to apoptosis and decreased mRNA expression, growth arrest without the induction of apoptosis of MO7e cells also leads to down-regulation of mRNA expression, suggesting an association with cell proliferation and not suppression of apoptosis. Nuclear localization of this SNF2-like putative helicase is dependent on a nuclear localization sequence located in the NH2-terminal region. Based on sequence homology to other SNF2-like helicases, the pattern of tissue expression, and the association of expression with cell proliferation, we refer to the protein product as proliferation-associated SNF2-like gene product [PASG (D. W. Lee et al., Blood, 94: 594a, 1999)]. Examination of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples revealed a high frequency of a PASG transcript containing an in-frame 75-nucleotide deletion, which codes for a conserved motif known to be critical for the transactivation activity of a related yeast SWI/SNF polypeptide. These results extend our knowledge of this SNF2-like family member and suggest a role for PASG in leukemogenesis.",
