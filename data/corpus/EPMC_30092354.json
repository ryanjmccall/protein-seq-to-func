  "abstract_text": "Regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation on insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is essential for insulin signaling. The protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) C1-Ten/Tensin2 has been implicated in the regulation of IRS-1, but the molecular basis of this dephosphorylation is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular phosphatase activity of C1-Ten/Tensin2 on IRS-1 is mediated by the binding of the C1-Ten/Tensin2 Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>). We show that the role of C1-Ten/Tensin2 is dependent on insulin-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. The C1-Ten/Tensin2 SH2 domain showed strong preference and high affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified three basic residues in the C1-Ten/Tensin2 SH2 domain that were critical for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> binding but were not involved in phosphotyrosine binding and PTP activity. Using a PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> binding-deficient mutant, we showed that the specific binding of the C1-Ten/Tensin2 SH2 domain to PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> allowed C1-Ten/Tensin2 to function as a PTP in cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that the interaction between the C1-Ten/Tensin2 SH2 domain and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> produces a negative feedback loop of insulin signaling through IRS-1.",
