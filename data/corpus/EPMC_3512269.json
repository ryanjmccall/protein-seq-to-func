    "abstract_text": "The primary structure of the alpha subunit of elongation factor 1 (EF-1 alpha) from human MOLT 4 cells was determined by cDNA sequencing. The data show that the conservation of the amino acid sequence is more than 80% when compared with yeast and Artemia EF-1 alpha. An inventory of amino acid sequences around the guanine-nucleotide-binding site in elongation factor Tu from Escherichia coli and homologous amino acid sequences in G proteins, initiation and elongation factors and proteins from the RAS family shows two regions containing conserved sequence elements. Region I has the sequence apolar-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Yaa-Xaa-Gly-LYs-Thr(Ser)- -Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-X-apolar. Except for RAS proteins, Yaa is always an acidic amino acid residue. Region II is characterized by the invariant sequence apolar-apolar-Xaa-Xaa-Asn-Lys-Xaa-Asp. In order to facilitate sequence comparison we have used a graphic display, which is based on the hydrophilicity values of individual amino acids in a sequence.",
