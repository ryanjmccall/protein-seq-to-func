  "title": "A mitochondrial DNA mutation linked to colon cancer results in proton leaks in cytochrome c oxidase.",
  "year": 2009,

  "abstract_text": "An increasing number of cancer types have been found to be linked to specific mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which result in specific structural changes of the respiratory enzyme complexes. In this study, we have investigated the effect of 2 such mutations identified in colon cancer patients, leading to the amino acid substitutions Ser458Pro and Gly125Asp in subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) [Greaves et al. (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:714-719]. We introduced these mutations in Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which carries an oxidase that serves as a model of the mitochondrial counterpart. The lack of expression of the former variant indicates that the amino acid substitution results in severely altered overall structure of the enzyme. The latter mutation (Gly171Asp in the bacterial oxidase) resulted in a structurally intact enzyme, but with reduced activity (approximately 30%), mainly due to slowed reduction of the redox site heme a. Furthermore, even though the Gly171Asp CytcO pumps protons, an intrinsic proton leak was identified, which would lead to a decreased overall energy-conversion efficiency of the respiratory chain, and would also perturb transport processes such as protein, ion, and metabolite trafficking. Furthermore, the specific leak may act to alter the balance between the electrical and chemical components of the proton electrochemical gradient.",
