    "abstract_text": "We have analyzed the nature of ligand-induced shift to higher molecular weight forms of the beta-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells. The modification of the beta-receptor was found to be due to polyubiquitination, as judged by immunoblotting using an anti-ubiquitin antiserum. A mutant beta-receptor made kinase negative by a point mutation (K634A mutant) did not undergo ubiquitination in response to ligand stimulation. A mutant in which carboxyl-terminal 98 amino acids were deleted (CT98 mutant) and which retained kinase activity was likewise not ubiquitinated. These data suggest that the kinase activity, as well as the carboxyl-terminal 98 amino acids, is required for ubiquitination of the beta-receptor. Ligand-induced degradation of the receptor-bound ligand, as well as of the receptor itself, was partially impaired in the CT98-receptor-expressing cells, suggesting that the ubiquitination is of importance for efficient degradation of the ligand-receptor complex.",
