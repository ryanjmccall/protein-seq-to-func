  "abstract_text": "The F-box protein FBXO31 is a tumor suppressor that is encoded in 16q24.3, for which there is loss of heterozygosity in various solid tumors. FBXO31 serves as the substrate-recognition component of the SKP/Cullin/F-box protein class of E3 ubiquitin ligases and has been shown to direct degradation of pivotal cell-cycle regulatory proteins including cyclin D1 and the p53 antagonist MDM2. FBXO31 levels are normally low but increase substantially following genotoxic stress through a mechanism that remains to be determined. Here we show that the low levels of FBXO31 are maintained through proteasomal degradation by anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). We find that the APC/C coactivators CDH1 and CDC20 bind to a destruction-box (D-box) motif present in FBXO31 to promote its polyubiquitination and degradation in a cell-cycle-regulated manner, which requires phosphorylation of FBXO31 on serine-33 by the prosurvival kinase AKT. Following genotoxic stress, phosphorylation of FBXO31 on serine-278 by another kinase, the DNA damage kinase ATM, results in disruption of its interaction with CDH1 and CDC20, thereby preventing FBXO31 degradation. Collectively, our results reveal how alterations in FBXO31 phosphorylation, mediated by AKT and ATM, underlie physiological regulation of FBXO31 levels in unstressed and genotoxically stressed cells.",
