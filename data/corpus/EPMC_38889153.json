Significance Aberrant regulation of chromatin modifiers is a hallmark of many cancers. This includes chromosomal rearrangements that cause expression of oncogenic fusion proteins, which are common drivers in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we identify transcriptional targets and small-molecule sensitivities of the MOZ-TIF2 fusion in a mouse model of leukemia. MOZ is an acyltransferase that catalyzes the understudied histone H3 Lys-23 propionylation (H3K23pr) posttranslational modification. Our genomic mapping studies show that H3K23pr correlates with gene expression levels and is sensitive to MOZ/MORF enzymatic inhibition in MOZ-TIF2 cells. We further show that MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 fusions dysregulate largely independent gene sets and exhibit differential enzymatic dependencies. Understanding these distinctions will inform development of targeted therapeutics for treating cancers harboring dysregulated MOZ. Aberrant regulation of chromatin modifiers is a common occurrence across many cancer types, and a key priority is to determine how specific alterations of these proteins, often enzymes, can be targeted therapeutically. MOZ, a histone acyltransferase, is recurrently fused to coactivators CBP, p300, and TIF2 in cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using either pharmacological inhibition or targeted protein degradation in a mouse model for MOZ-TIF2-driven leukemia, we show that KAT6 (MOZ/MORF) enzymatic activity and the MOZ-TIF2 protein are necessary for indefinite proliferation in cell culture. MOZ-TIF2 directly regulates a small subset of genes encoding developmental transcription factors, augmenting their high expression. Furthermore, transcription levels in MOZ-TIF2 cells positively correlate with enrichment of histone H3 propionylation at lysine 23 (H3K23pr), a recently appreciated histone acylation associated with gene activation.

King Trust 100008601 N/A Samuel D Whedon Chromosomal translocations that result in expression of oncogenic fusion proteins are a common occurrence in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These include fusions harboring Monocytic Leukemia Zinc-Finger Protein (MOZ, also known as KAT6A), a MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, and Tip60 (MYST) family acyltransferase that is known to acetylate H3 Lys-9, Lys-14, and Lys-23 in vitro ( 1 ), but mainly Lys-23 in vivo ( 2 , 3 ). In cases of AML, MOZ is recurrently fused to p300, CREB Binding Protein (CBP), and the coactivator Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2 (NCOA2/TIF2) ( 4 – 6 ), likely creating a gain-of-function driver that includes two distinct histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domains or, in the case of MOZ-TIF2, recruits additional HAT-containing proteins ( 7 ). Identification of genetic targets of MOZ fusions and understanding their potential mechanism of action is important for generation of future AML therapies for patients harboring these translocations or possessing increased MOZ activity. MOZ (KAT6A) and its paralog, MOZ-related factor (MORF/KAT6B), function in protein complexes that include BRPF1, ING4/5, and MEAF6 ( 8 , 9 ). The MOZ and MORF (KAT6) complexes are essential for development and are involved in hematopoiesis and neural stem cell maintenance ( 10 – 13 ). The MOZ protein was first identified as part of a fusion protein with CBP, and MOZ-fusion proteins in AML have been correlated with poor patient prognosis ( 14 ). Deletion of either the MYST domain of MOZ or the CBP/p300 binding domain of TIF2 causes loss of in vitro cell colony formation or in vivo leukemogenesis in mouse models of MOZ-TIF2 driven AML ( 7 , 15 ). Dysregulation of MOZ has also been implicated in solid tumors. MOZ is part of a chromosome amplification in a subset of breast cancers where knockdown reduced in vitro proliferation ( 16 ). Additionally, small-molecule inhibition of MOZ has antitumor activity in MOZ overexpressing breast cancer and correlates with decreased gene expression and global H3K23ac ( 17 ). MOZ and MORF target a broad range of unmethylated CpG-rich promoters with high specificity to transcription start sites (TSSs) ( 18 , 19 ). Genetic loss or enzymatic inhibition of MOZ/MORF subunits has been shown to reduce global levels of H3K9ac and H3K23ac ( 17 , 20 , 21 ), as well as H3K23 propionylation (H3K23pr), a recently appreciated histone acylation that associates with active chromatin ( 3 , 22 , 23 ). Histone acylation marks are deposited by HAT proteins but are independently derived from their respective coA molecules ( 22 , 24 ). Defects in H3K23pr have been implicated in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders ( 3 , 22 ). Therefore, global genomic mapping of this histone modification in normal and cancer contexts is an important priority. The role of Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL) rearrangements (MLL-r) and MLL-fusion oncoproteins in AML has been extensively studied ( 25 ). Endogenous MOZ function has been implicated in MLL-r leukemia, as MOZ knock-out prevents the ability of MLL-r cells to induce leukemia in mouse models and abrogates proliferation of human AML patient-derived cell lines in culture ( 18 , 26 ). Cell culture experiments indicate that MOZ and MLL fusion proteins share genetic and enzymatic dependencies during mouse hematopoietic progenitor immortalization and that MLL recruits MOZ and RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) to CpG rich promoters in HEK293T cells ( 15 ). Recent analysis categorizing transcription in pediatric AML revealed that MLL-r and MOZ-r leukemias cluster into a group delineated by high Homeobox A (HOXA) and low Homeobox B (HOXB) expression ( 27 ). Overall, this suggests that MOZ and MLL leukemic fusions may have similar genetic targets and function through a shared mechanism, which we explore here using genome-wide analyses of MOZ-TIF2 binding sites and direct transcriptional defects in a mouse leukemia model. Using both targeted protein degradation and small-molecule inhibition, we show that MOZ/MORF enzymatic activity is required in MOZ-TIF2 leukemic mouse cells and that the continued presence of MOZ-TIF2 is required for cell proliferation. We further identify MOZ-TIF2 direct transcriptional targets and show that high transcription levels are correlated with H3K23pr enrichment. Unexpectedly, we find that MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 degradation in their respective leukemic mouse cell lines transcriptionally down-regulate distinct sets of genes and respond differentially to enzymatic inhibition of key MLL-fusion regulators. We propose that these two-fusion protein-driven models of leukemia may represent highly related cell states but potentially require distinct or combinatorial therapeutic strategies. Results MOZ-TIF2 Perturbation Halts Cell Proliferation and Induces Differentiation. To dissect the transcriptional effects of the MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein, we transduced Lin − Sca-1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cells, which contain a population of hematopoietic stem cells, with a MOZ-TIF2 human cDNA transgene to create a primary leukemia cell line derived from mice ( Fig. 1 A ). We then inhibited MOZ-TIF2, MOZ, and MORF enzymatic activities through treatment with WM-1119, a small-molecule inhibitor that targets MYST acetyltransferase domains with selectivity for KAT6 ( 21 ). MOZ-TIF2 LSKs were treated with WM-1119 for 15 d with a titration between 3 nM and 10 μM. Cells exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation by day 6 with an IC50 of 25 nM. Since WM-1119 inhibits all KAT6 proteins, this phenotype may be due to loss of activity of MOZ-TIF2, MOZ, MORF, or a combination of all three. Notably, WM-1119 treatment had no impact on MLL-AF9 LSK proliferation at this time point ( Fig. 1 B ). Fig. 1. MOZ/MORF enzymatic activity is selectively required in MOZ-TIF2 leukemic LSK cells. ( A ) Schematic of the MOZ-TIF2 cDNA transgene containing the NEMM (N-terminal part of Enok), double PHD fingers, the MYST acetyltransferase domains of MOZ and the CBP/p300 interacting domain (CID) and Activation Domain (AD2) of TIF2 ( Top ).

( D and E ) Cell proliferation assays of MOZ-TIF2 or MLL-AF9 LSKs treated with ( D ) A-485 or ( E ) dCBP for the indicated number of days. Absolute IC50 values calculated for day 6 are reported on each graph. These results were surprising given previous studies of mouse hematopoietic progenitor immortalization ( 15 , 26 ) and our analysis of DepMap CRISPR dropout screens in human cancer cell lines ( https://depmap.org/portal/ ). Shared genetic codependencies between wild-type MOZ and MLL include MOZ/MORF complex members, BRPF1 and ING5. Furthermore, MLL, MOZ, and MORF are also codependent with each other ( Fig. 1 C ). While insensitivity of MLL-AF9 mouse leukemia cells to WM-1119 was unexpected, previous work showed that knock-out of MOZ in MLL-AF9 hematopoietic progenitor cells still allowed colony formation, although at reduced levels relative to the wild type ( 26 ). Furthermore, specific inhibition of MOZ/MORF enzymatic activity might be less disruptive than a complete absence of the MOZ protein. The differential effects of WM-1119 comparing MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 cells correlated with the presence of the MOZ-TIF2 fusion. However, mouse MYC-driven lymphoma cells were previously shown to be sensitive to WM-1119 treatment ( 21 ). Additionally, we found that proliferation of human OCI-AML3 leukemia cells, which contain a DNMT3 and NPM1 mutation but no known chromosomal abnormalities ( 28 ), were also sensitive to WM-1119 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 A ). This indicates that WM-1119 sensitivity is not solely dependent on the MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein. TIF2 contains a p300/CBP interacting domain (CID) that is maintained in the MOZ-TIF2 fusion. Deletion of this domain has been shown to abrogate in vitro colony formation and in vivo leukemogenesis in mouse models ( 7 ). To test whether retention of p300/CBP enzymatic activity is also required in MOZ-TIF2 LSKs, we treated cells with A-485, a small molecule that inhibits p300/CBP activity by competitive acetyl-coA binding ( 29 ). We found that A-485 treatment halted cell proliferation within 6 d of treatment in both cell lines. In contrast to WM-1119 treatment, MLL-AF9 and MOZ-TIF2 LSKs showed similar proliferative responses and comparable IC50 values ( Fig. 1 D ). In parallel, we treated cells with dCBP, a recently developed chemical degrader which selectively targets both p300 and CBP ( 30 ). We found that both MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 cells were sensitive to degradation of p300 and CBP, as proliferation decreased following dCBP treatment in a dose-dependent manner. However, MOZ-TIF2 cells showed greater sensitivity relative to MLL-AF9 (IC 50 = 75 nM vs. 1.4 μM) ( Fig. 1 E ), providing support for a model in which aberrant recruitment of p300/CBP by TIF2 is an important component of MOZ-TIF2 driven oncogenesis. We confirmed that p300 and CBP were degraded in cultured LSK cells by western blot after treatment of MOZ-TIF2 LSKs with a titration of dCBP for 3 h ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 B ). As MOZ/MORF inhibition is selectively deleterious in MOZ-TIF2 cells, we focused our efforts on determining how WM-1119 treatment alters transcription. We performed nascent RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) on both MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 LSKs treated with 70 nM (IC90) WM-1119 for 5 d. We reasoned that these conditions would reveal the transcriptional landscape just prior to inhibitor-induced changes in MOZ-TIF2 cell proliferation. In MOZ-TIF2 cells, 494 and 202 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated (log2 fold change >1/<−1 and FDR < 0.05), respectively, after WM-1119 treatment ( Fig. 2 A and Dataset S1 ). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results suggested that MOZ inhibition in MOZ-TIF2 LSK cells turns on a hematopoietic differentiation program, as differentially expressed genes were enriched in gene sets involved in myeloid development and mature hematopoietic cells ( Fig. 2 B ). Additionally, the cell morphology of MOZ-TIF2 LSKs following WM-1119 treatment was consistent with differentiation ( Fig. 2 C ). Strikingly, no significant changes in gene expression were observed in MLL-AF9 LSK cells following WM-1119 treatment and they retained a blast-like morphology ( Fig. 2 A and C ). These results are consistent with the insensitivity of MLL-AF9 cell proliferation to MOZ/MORF inhibition. Overall, these results show that MOZ-TIF2 cells are selectively dependent on the enzymatic activities of MOZ-TIF2, MOZ, MORF, or a combination of all three proteins and that loss of enzymatic activity over time likely pushes cells toward a differentiated state.

H3K23pr Is Correlated with Gene Expression and Is Sensitive to MOZ/MORF Inhibition. Recent work by XJ Yang et al. reported that both MOZ and MORF catalyze H3K23 propionylation (H3K23pr) in addition to H3K23 and H3K9 acetylation ( 3 ). In their work, deletion of KAT6A or BRPF1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts reduced overall H3K23pr levels. Based on these discoveries, we asked whether H3K23pr was detectable in MOZ-TIF2 LSK cells, and if so, whether levels were sensitive to MOZ/MORF inhibition through WM-1119 treatment. Western blots of whole cell lysates of MOZ-TIF2 LSKs revealed the presence of H3K23pr and its sensitivity to WM-1119 treatment, as global levels were reduced following WM-1119 treatment in a time and dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 3 A ). As expected, WM-1119 treatment also reduced overall H3K23ac levels ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A and B ). Fig. 3. H3K23pr is enriched on expressed genes and is sensitive to MOZ/MORF enzymatic inhibition. ( A ) Western blot of H3K23pr levels in MOZ-TIF2 cell lysates treated with 0.5 μM, 1 μM, or 10 μM WM-1119 for 1, 3, or 6 h. GAPDH was utilized as a loading control.

Rows are ordered by decreasing H3K23pr. Heatmaps are separated by MOZ-TIF2 direct ( Top ) or nontranscriptional ( Bottom ) targets. ( F ) Genome browser tracks showing representative MOZ-TIF2 transcriptional targets with their H3K23ac profiles and H3K23pr profiles in DMSO and WM-1119 treated samples. Scales represent IP enrichment scaled to Drosophila spike-in DNA with input signal subtracted. Acetyl and propionyl groups are highly related and differ by only one methylene group ( 31 ). We used antibodies that were previously validated for their specificity by Yan et al. to rule out cross-reactivity ( 3 ). We further validated the specificity of the H3K23ac and H3K23pr antibodies by performing peptide competition assays ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 C ). The connection between MOZ and MORF activity and H3K23 propionylation was further supported by RNAi knockdown of enok , the Drosophila MOZ/MORF ortholog, in salivary glands, where H3K23pr levels were dependent on enok expression ( Fig. 3 B ). This shows that H3K23pr is conserved in a distant species and is catalyzed by an orthologous KAT6 protein. Taken together, our work strongly supports a role for KAT6 proteins in H3K23pr. Based on the striking regulation of cellular H3K23pr by WM-1119 and paucity of information on the distribution of this chromatin mark, we proceeded to map H3K23pr at the genomic level. We performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) against H3K23pr in MOZ-TIF2 LSKs treated with DMSO or 1 μM WM-1119 for 1 h. We reasoned that these conditions would reflect relatively immediate effects of MOZ/MORF inhibition while limiting indirect effects on downstream genes. Exogenous chromatin from Drosophila S2 cells was added to each sample as a spike-in normalization control to allow comparison of overall H3K23pr levels between treated and untreated samples ( 32 ). While H3K23pr signal showed low amplitude compared to input, typical of broad histone marks ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 D ), we found that overall signal decreased following WM-1119 treatment at the 8,614 significant peaks shared between two biological replicates, providing validation for our genomic mapping ( Fig. 3 C ). Peak annotation indicated that a majority of H3K23pr enrichment overlaps with annotated mouse genes (75%, n = 6,497) and the overall genomic distribution did not change following WM-1119 treatment ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 E ). This suggests that WM-1119 treatment results in a uniform loss of H3K23pr, rather than a redistribution or biased loss at genic vs. intergenic regions. Immunoprecipitation with an H3K23pr antibody followed by immunoblotting for additional histone PTMs previously revealed association with active chromatin marks, such as H3K14ac, which is known to stimulate MORF-mediated H3K23ac ( 3 , 33 ). To address whether H3K23pr associates with active chromatin at the genomic level, we binned annotated mouse genes into quartiles by their baseline RNA expression levels measured in our nascent RNA-seq analysis. Genes were categorized as either having no, low, mid, or high expression levels based on normalized RNA-seq read counts over genes in DMSO-treated MOZ-TIF2 LSK cells. We found that H3K23pr positively correlates with gene expression, as the highest enrichment occurred over highly expressed genes, just downstream of the TSS. In contrast, genes with low or no expression had minimal signal. ChIP-seq of H3K23ac in untreated MOZ-TIF2 cells showed a similar correlation of enrichment to gene expression ( Fig. 3 D ). Taken together, our analysis supports an association of H3K23pr with active chromatin regions and its sensitivity to MOZ/MORF inhibition. MOZ-TIF2 Targets Genes Encoding Highly Expressed Developmental Transcription Factors. To directly assay how loss of MOZ-TIF2 impacts leukemic cell growth, we took advantage of the dTAG degradation system, in which treatment of cells with dTAG13 induces dimerization of FKBP12 F36V with the CRBN E3 ligase complex, triggering rapid proteasomal degradation ( 34 ). To utilize this system, we generated an additional primary leukemia cell line with the MOZ-TIF2 transgene containing an FKBPV12 F36V -hemagluttinin epitope tag (FKBPV12-HA-MT2). The FKBPV12-HA-MT2 fusion protein was undetectable in leukemic FKBPV12-HA-MT2 LSK cells after 2 h treatment with 500 nM dTAG13 and remained absent after 24 h ( Fig. 4 A ). We found that MOZ-TIF2 cells were dependent on the continued presence of the fusion protein, as degradation exhausted cell proliferation after 6 d. Importantly, proliferation of untagged MOZ-TIF2 cells was unaffected by dTAG13 treatment ( Fig. 4 B ). Fig. 4. MOZ-TIF2 binds to and transcriptionally regulates developmental genes.

( K ) Pie charts of MOZ-TIF2 direct or nontranscriptional targets indicating the percentage of genes in each category that fall into their defined RNA-expression quartile. We next asked which genes may be direct transcriptional targets of MOZ-TIF2 by performing nascent RNA-seq followed by differential gene expression analysis on FKBPV12-HA-MOZ-TIF2 cells treated with dTAG13 for 2 h. Almost all significantly altered genes were down-regulated after 2 h of MOZ-TIF2 degradation (n = 145, log 2 fold change < −1 and FDR < 0.05), consistent with MOZ-TIF2 acting as a transcriptional activator ( Fig. 4 C and Dataset S2 ). In parallel, we also treated MOZ-TIF2 cells with WM-1119 (1 μM for 1 h) to compare direct transcriptional effects following MOZ/MORF inhibition. Nascent RNA-seq followed by differential gene expression analysis identified 154 and 885 significantly down- and up-regulated genes, respectively ( Fig. 4 C and Dataset S3 ). Although most differentially expressed genes were transcriptionally up-regulated, these genes exhibited low expression levels and less significant P -values ( Fig. 4 C and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 A ). Comparison of dTAG13 and WM-1119 treated datasets showed a high degree of overlap between significantly down-regulated genes (n = 105) ( Fig. 4 D and Dataset S4 ). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed this list to be highly enriched for genes involved in transcription factor activity and DNA binding with RNA PolII ( Fig. 4 D and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 B ). Many of these genes have known involvement in AML and play important roles in hematopoiesis, including HoxA9, Gfi1, and Six1 ( 35 – 37 ). These results suggest that the presence of MOZ-TIF2 correlates with aberrant overexpression of developmental transcription factors. The significant overlap between down-regulated genes following WM-1119 or dTAG13 treatment further suggests that transcriptional dysregulation in MOZ-TIF2 LSKs is mainly driven by the presence of the fusion protein. We next identified MOZ-TIF2 genomic binding sites by performing Cut and Run analysis targeting the HA epitope of the FKBPV12-HA-MOZ-TIF2 transgene. Peak calling analysis and genome annotation revealed that almost all peaks (98%, n = 2,310) were annotated to promoter regions, defined as within 2 kilobases 5′ and 3′ of the TSS ( Fig. 4 E ). This is consistent with previously published ChIP-seq experiments showing that wild-type MOZ binds with high specificity to promoter regions in human MOLM-13 cells ( 18 ). MOZ-TIF2 signal was depleted at these sites after 2 h dTAG13 treatment, supporting the validity of called peaks ( Fig. 4 F and G ). To define direct MOZ-TIF2 transcriptional targets, we integrated our Cut and Run and nascent RNA-seq datasets. Genes bound by MOZ-TIF2 and significantly down-regulated after 2 h of dTAG13 treatment were identified as MOZ-TIF2 direct targets (n = 73). We defined the remaining 1,779 MOZ-TIF2 bound promoters that had no significant change in gene expression following MOZ-TIF2 degradation as MOZ-TIF2 nontranscriptional targets ( Fig. 4 G and H and Dataset S5 ). While only a small fraction of bound genes were significantly affected within 2 h of MOZ-TIF2 degradation, it is not uncommon for transcription factors to exhibit widespread binding without evidence of direct gene regulation ( 38 ). Furthermore, nontranscriptional targets did not have significant changes in gene expression but did trend slightly downward following MOZ-TIF2 degradation and MOZ/MORF inhibition ( Fig. 4 G ). Nontranscriptional targets showed enrichment for housekeeping functions, such as regulation of histone modification and mRNA metabolism. This contrasts with MOZ-TIF2 direct targets, which had enrichment for GO biological processes related to developmental organ and tissue morphogenesis ( Fig. 4 I ). While it would be informative to compare MOZ-TIF2 with endogenous MOZ binding patterns, our attempts to tag and map wild-type MOZ were unsuccessful. Overall, our results suggest that MOZ-TIF2 directly contributes to aberrant expression of genes that are normally regulated by a developmental program. Of note, MOZ-TIF2 direct targets had, on average, high baseline gene expression levels relative to nontranscriptional targets ( Fig. 4 J ). When binned into RNA expression quartiles, 73% and 23% of direct targets exhibited high or mid-level baseline gene expression, respectively. Only a fraction of direct targets had low expression levels (4%) ( Fig. 4 K ). Furthermore, most direct targets displayed reduced expression rather than becoming transcriptionally inactive following dTAG13 or WM-1119 treatment ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 C ). In contrast, nontranscriptional targets exhibited a range of expression levels ( Fig. 3 K and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 C ). Consistent with the transcriptional status of MOZ-TIF2 targets, H3K23pr and H3K23ac were enriched at these genes, positively correlated with RNA expression, and colocalized with MOZ-TIF2 in regions surrounding the TSS ( Fig. 3 E and F ). MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 Fusion Proteins Have Distinct Small-Molecule Sensitivities and Share Few Transcriptional Targets. The disparate phenotypes we observed in MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 leukemic LSKs following WM-1119 treatment led us to ask whether the fusion proteins might create additional distinct dependencies. In addition to MOZ/MORF complex members, wild-type MOZ and MLL share many genetic codependencies, including DOT1L and Menin (MEN1) ( Fig. 1 C ). The dependency of cells harboring MLL-fusion proteins on DOT1L enzymatic activity and MEN1-MLL protein interactions has been extensively studied ( 39 – 41 ). In agreement, we confirmed that treatment of MLL-AF9 LSKs with VTP-50469 or EPZ-5676 to inhibit Menin-MLL and Dot1L, respectively, reduced cell proliferation. However, MOZ-TIF2 cells were clearly less sensitive to the same treatments with these compounds ( Fig. 5 A and B ). Fig. 5. MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 regulate independent sets of genes.

Rows are ordered by decreasing RNA expression in MLL-AF9 LSKs. ( F ) Model of transcriptional dysregulation and associated H3K23pr by MOZ-TIF2 and KAT6 proteins. To compare overall gene expression profiles, we performed differential expression analysis on our DMSO-treated MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 LSK nascent RNA-seq datasets. We found that cells carrying each fusion differed broadly in their transcriptional landscapes, with 727 and 1,173 being significantly up- or down-regulated in MOZ-TIF2 relative to MLL-AF9 cells ( Fig. 5 C and Dataset S6 ). Strikingly, genes whose transcription is sensitive to MOZ-TIF2 (this study) or MLL-AF9 degradation ( 42 ) showed significantly higher levels of transcription in their respective cell type (MOZ-TIF2: n = 91/145, MLL-AF9 n = 85/163), while anticorrelations were rare (MOZ-TIF2: n = 1/145, MLL-AF9: n = 2/163) ( Fig. 5 C ). Examples of differentially expressed genes include MOZ-TIF2 direct targets Six1 and Gfi1, as well as MLL-AF9 highly sensitive genes, Pbx3 and Mecom ( Fig. 5 D ). Furthermore, we found that MOZ-TIF2 did not bind MLL-AF9 sensitive genes in MOZ-TIF2 cells ( Fig. 5 E ), despite binding ~2,000 promoter regions across the genome ( Fig. 4 G ). Many MLL-AF9 sensitive genes also showed little to no transcription in MOZ-TIF2 cells ( Fig. 5 E ). While unexpected, these data show that MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 cause transcriptional dysregulation of distinct sets of genes. Intriguingly, we noted that expression of the HoxA locus, a transcriptional target in both cell types, differs in MLL-AF9 and MOZ-TIF2 cells. HoxA1-6 showed high nascent RNA expression in MLL-AF9 LSKs, whereas MOZ-TIF2 cells exhibited higher expression over HoxA9-13, correlating with MOZ-TIF2 binding ( Fig. 5 D ). Since HoxA9 is considered to be a critical target of MLL fusions ( 43 , 44 ), but our nascent RNA analysis differed from published mRNA seq profiles of MLL-AF9 cells ( 42 ), we performed mRNA-seq to confirm the stable RNA expression profile of the HoxA locus in our MLL-AF9 LSKs. This confirmed that our MLL-AF9 LSK cells express the highest levels of HoxA9 and HoxA10 mRNA. MOZ-TIF2 cells express higher levels of HoxA10 and HoxA11 ( Fig. 5 D ). Taken together, our results suggest that MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 drive the adoption or persistence of distinct cell states. Discussion Recurrent fusion proteins are highly prevalent in AML but only a small fraction have been extensively studied. Here, we add to overall knowledge of leukemic fusion proteins by identifying MOZ-TIF2 transcriptional targets in a mouse model of leukemia. We find that MOZ-TIF2 directly binds to and augments transcription of a set of developmental genes known to be implicated in AML. Small-molecule inhibition of MOZ/MORF or targeted degradation of MOZ-TIF2 reduces aberrant expression of these genes. Additionally, we provide genomic binding profiles for H3K23pr, demonstrate its sensitivity to MOZ/MORF inhibition through WM-1119 treatment, and show positive correlation with gene expression. Genes with high H3K23pr include MOZ-TIF2 transcriptional targets, implicating MOZ acyltransferase activity in H3K23pr deposition and aberrant gene expression ( Fig. 5 F ). Through a combination of enzymatic inhibition, targeted protein degradation, RNA-seq, and global profiling of MOZ-TIF2 genomic binding, we identify genes that are directly regulated by MOZ-TIF2. Of note, we observed that MOZ/MORF inhibition or MOZ-TIF2 degradation did not turn off transcription of MOZ-TIF2 targets. Rather, expression levels were dampened by perturbation of MOZ-TIF2 activity. It is possible that, instead of turning on transcription of oncogenes, MOZ-TIF2 prevents repression of a key set of HSC genes. This may prevent correct entry into hematopoietic differentiation pathways, resulting in leukemogenesis. The HAT domain of MOZ, the p300/CBP binding domain of TIF2, and endogenous MOZ have been shown to be required for MOZ-TIF2 leukemogenesis ( 7 , 15 , 45 ). Through small-molecule inhibition and targeted protein degradation, we report that the acyl/acetyl-transferase activities of MOZ/MORF and p300/CBP, as well as the continued presence of p300 and/or CBP, are required for MOZ-TIF2 cell proliferation. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that MOZ/MORF inhibition through WM-1119 treatment results in a hematopoietic differentiation genetic profile, likely contributing to decreased proliferation. Overall, these results support targeting MOZ/MORF enzymatic activity through small-molecule drugs to reduce leukemic phenotypes in MOZ-r leukemias and possibly in additional tumors dependent upon MOZ activity. In comparing transcriptional profiles of MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 LSK cells, we unexpectedly found evidence that the fusions directly regulate disparate sets of genes and are not equally sensitive to the inhibition of additional chromatin regulators. These results were surprising, as recent reports provide evidence that MOZ-r and MLL-r leukemias have similar targets and genetic dependencies. Engineered fusions of the N termini of MOZ and MLL to various partners in mouse hematopoietic cells resulted in increased colony formation and HoxA9 expression, suggesting that MLL and MOZ are interchangeable ( 15 ). These fusion proteins were also equally sensitive to MLL, DOT1L, and p300/CBP inhibition when assayed for the ability of mouse hematopoietic progenitors to form colonies in semisolid media. Furthermore, MLL-r mouse cells were dependent on endogenous MOZ in gene knockdown studies, especially in the induction of leukemia in vivo ( 26 ). One important difference between the prior work and our current analysis is that we utilized cells that were already established as a primary leukemia in the mouse prior to any experimentation. Thus, differences in inhibitor sensitivities could be due to higher requirements for induction of immortalized progenitors in cell culture or leukemia in mice compared to the maintenance and growth of already established leukemia cells. Importantly, AML patients will present with established leukemia, so investigation of effective strategies to perturb maintenance, in addition to understanding induction, is of clear clinical relevance. Multiple approaches, including the use of patient-derived xenografts, combinations of small molecules with improved selectivity and pharmacokinetics, and ongoing clinical trials will clearly be necessary to understand and treat AML subtypes and other diseases involving MOZ-induced transcriptional dysregulation. Materials and Methods Small-Molecule Inhibitor and Degrader Cell Proliferation Assays. For WM-1119 (MedChemExpress Cat #HY-102058), A-485 ( 46 ), JQAD1 (MedChemExpress Cat #HY-145765), and dCBP (MedChemExpress Cat #HY-134582) proliferation studies, cells were plated at 2.5 x 10 5 cells/mL in a 96-well format (50,000 cells per well) and treated with limiting dilutions of drug or 0.1% DMSO. The cells were replated every 3 d, and fresh drug/DMSO was added. Cell viability was assayed based on DNA content, as measured by the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen P11496). PicoGreen fluorescent signal was measured using the BioTek Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Reader (Agilent). Ratios of fluorescence in drug relative to DMSO control were plotted. For VTP-50496 and EPZ-5675 proliferation studies, cells were plated at 1 x 10 5 cells/mL in a 96-well format (20,000 cells per well) and treated as described above. Viable (DAPI-, Santa Cruz) cells were counted in 30 mL of media plus 120 μL PBS/DAPI using an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Ratios of cell numbers in drug to DMSO control were then plotted. GraphPad Prism software was used to generate graphs and calculate IC50 values. Nascent RNA and mRNA-seq. For MOZ/MORF inhibition transcriptional analysis, MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 LSKs were treated with DMSO or WM-1119 (70 nM for 5 d or 1 μM for 1 h). For MOZ-TIF2 degradation studies, FKBPV12-HA-MOZ-TIF2 cells were treated with 500 nM dTAG13 (MedChem Express HY-114421) for 2 h. To extract nascent RNA, approximately 10 million cells were harvested, and nuclei were extracted with nuclear extraction buffer (10% sucrose, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with SUPERaseIN (Invitrogen AM2696). Nuclei were resuspended in 160 μL CF buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, and 25 mM EDTA) supplemented with SUPERaseIN. 1 mL fresh NUN buffer (1.5 M urea, 20 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM EDTA, and 1% NP-40) was immediately added to lyse nuclei. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min to precipitate genomic DNA, histones, engaged RNA PolII, and nascent transcripts. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min, and pellets were washed twice with NUN buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 700 μL CF buffer supplemented with 1 mg/mL Proteinase K and 1% SDS and incubated for 1 h at 55 °C to remove protein. Nucleic acids were isolated with phenol–chloroform extraction. DNA was removed with Turbo DNAse (Invitrogen AM2238). RNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. To remove residual DNA, a second DNAse treatment was performed, and RNA was purified and measured on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. To extract mRNA, approximately 2.5 million MOZ-TIF2 or MLL-AF9 LSK cells were harvested. Total mRNA was extracted using the NEB Total RNA Extraction and Purification Kit (New England Biolabs T2010S). Ribosomal RNA was removed through PolyA enrichment (New England Biolabs E7490S). All sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Preparation Kit (New England Biolabs E7760). Library concentration and fragment sizes were analyzed with the Agilent Tape Station. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using the Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Facility. RNA-seq Analysis. Adapter contamination was removed from fastq with cutadapt 4.1 ( 47 ). Reads were then aligned to the mouse mm10 genome using bowtie 2.5.1 ( 48 ), and sequences that aligned to ribosomal RNA were removed. Reads aligning to annotated mouse transcripts were counted using SummarizeOverlaps in the GenomicAlignments Bioconductor package ( 49 ), and differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package ( 50 ). BigWig files were generated using Deeptools BamCoverage 3.5.0 ( 51 ). PANTHER Classification System ( 52 ) and clusterProfiler ( 53 ) were used for GO analysis. ChIP-seq. For ChIP-seq, approximately 10 million MOZ-TIF2 LSK cells per ChIP reaction were harvested and spiked-in with 5 x 10 5 (5%) Drosophila S2 cells. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 8 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were washed two times in PBS and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.2% NaN 3 , and 0.5% SDS). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 10 min and resuspended in IP buffer [2 parts SDS buffer plus 1 part Triton dilution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% NaN 3 , and 5% Triton X-100)]. Chromatin was sheared using a QSonica probe sonicator for 16 cycles with 15 s on and 45 s off with an amplitude of 40%. 1% of sheared chromatin was removed for input. For immunoprecipitation, 6 μg of H3K23pr (PTM Biolabs PTM-205) and H3K23ac (Millipore 07-355) antibodies were bound to Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen 10001D) by incubating 2 h at 4 °C. Sheared chromatin was diluted with 9x volume of ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and 167 mM NaCl). Chromatin was then added to antibody-bound beads and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Next, beads were sequentially washed 2x each with low-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and 150 mM NaCl), high-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and 500 mM NaCl), LiCl buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CH 630, 1% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and 1 mM EDTA), and 1x TE buffer. Chromatin was then eluted with fresh elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1M sodium bicarbonate). To reverse cross-link, Proteinase K and RNase A were added to chromatin and incubated overnight at 65 °C. DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR clean-up columns and protocol (Qiagen Cat #28104). Sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB Cat #E7645S). Library concentration and fragment sizes were analyzed with the Agilent Tape Station. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at the Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Facility. ChIP-seq Analysis. Adaptor contamination and low-quality reads were removed from fastq files with Trimmomatic 0.36 ( 54 ). Reads were aligned to both the mouse mm10 or Drosophila dm6 genome using bowtie 2.5.1 ( 48 ). Duplicate reads were removed with samtools 1.14 using the markdup command ( 55 ). Aligned mouse bam files were normalized to Counts per Million (CPM) and input reads were subtracted from IP reads using deepTools bamCompare ( 51 ). To normalize to Drosophila spike-in DNA, we first reversed the CPM normalization of mouse reads by scaling to the original number of uniquely aligned mouse IP reads in each sample using deepTools bigwigCompare with the–scaleFactors setting. Next, a scaling factor for each sample was calculated based on Orlando et al. ( 32 ) using the number of S2 reads that uniquely aligned to the Drosophila genome. Mouse reads were then normalized to their appropriate scaling factor using deepTools bigwigCompare with the–scaleFactors setting to generate bigwig files that were normalized to both the input and spike-in control. Significant peaks across two biological replicates were called using epic2 ( 56 ) with a 1,000 bp bin size and bin gap of 3. BEDTools intersect ( 57 ) was used to assign peaks to gene bodies, promoters, or intergenic regions. Cut and Run. FKBPV12-HA-MOZ-TIF2 LSK cells were treated with DMSO or 500 nM dTAG13 (MedChem Express HY-114421) for 2 h. Cut and Run was performed based on EpiCypher’s CUTANA CUT&RUN protocol. In summary, CUTANA Concanavalin A (ConA) beads (Epicypher 21-1401) were activated in bead activation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 1 mM MnCl 2 ). FKBPV12-HA-MOZ-TIF2 LSK cells (5 x 10 5 per sample) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, and protease inhibitor). Cells were then added to 10 μL/sample activated ConA beads. Cell-bound ConA beads were resuspended in antibody buffer (wash buffer, 0.01% digitonin, and 2 mM EDTA) with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling 3724S) at a 1:50 dilution and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The cell+antibody bound beads were washed and resuspended in cell permeabilization buffer (wash buffer + 0.1% digitonin). CUTANA pAG-Mnase (Epicypher 15-1016) was added to 1x final concentration and incubated at room temperature for 10 min to bind pAG-Mnase to the primary antibody. Cells were washed and resuspended in cell permeabilization buffer. To activate pAG-Mnase, CaCl 2 was added to 0.5 mM final concentration. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Stop buffer (340 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 4 mM EGTA, 50 μg/mL RNase A, and 50 μg/mL glycogen) was added, and digested chromatin was released by mixing tubes at 37 °C for 10 min at 500 rpm. DNA was purified using the QIAGEN PCR cleanup kit and protocol. (Qiagen Cat #28104). Sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB Cat #E7645S). Library concentration and fragment sizes were analyzed with the Agilent Tape Station. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at the Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Facility. Cut and Run Analysis. Adaptor read contamination was removed from fastq files with cutadapt 4.1 ( 47 ). Reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 genome using bowtie 2.5.1 ( 48 ). Duplicate reads were removed with samtools 1.14 using the markdup command ( 55 ). Deeptools ( 51 ) was used to create bigwig files normalized to 1x genome coverage and sample matched IgG signal was subtracted. Significant peaks across two biological replicates were called using SEACR ( 58 ). ChIPPeakAnno (Bioconductor R) was used to assign peaks to genomic regions. BEDTools intersect ( 57 ) was used to assign peaks to promoter regions. Data Visualization and Figure Generation. Deeptools, Integrative genomics browser (IGV), GraphPad Prism, and ggplot2 (Rstudio) were utilized for data visualization ( 51 , 59 ). Adobe Illustrator and BioRender were used for figure generation.

  "plain_text": "Significance Aberrant regulation of chromatin modifiers is a hallmark of many cancers. This includes chromosomal rearrangements that cause expression of oncogenic fusion proteins, which are common drivers in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we identify transcriptional targets and small-molecule sensitivities of the MOZ-TIF2 fusion in a mouse model of leukemia. MOZ is an acyltransferase that catalyzes the understudied histone H3 Lys-23 propionylation (H3K23pr) posttranslational modification. Our genomic mapping studies show that H3K23pr correlates with gene expression levels and is sensitive to MOZ/MORF enzymatic inhibition in MOZ-TIF2 cells. We further show that MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 fusions dysregulate largely independent gene sets and exhibit differential enzymatic dependencies. Understanding these distinctions will inform development of targeted therapeutics for treating cancers harboring dysregulated MOZ.\n\nAberrant regulation of chromatin modifiers is a common occurrence across many cancer types, and a key priority is to determine how specific alterations of these proteins, often enzymes, can be targeted therapeutically. MOZ, a histone acyltransferase, is recurrently fused to coactivators CBP, p300, and TIF2 in cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using either pharmacological inhibition or targeted protein degradation in a mouse model for MOZ-TIF2-driven leukemia, we show that KAT6 (MOZ/MORF) enzymatic activity and the MOZ-TIF2 protein are necessary for indefinite proliferation in cell culture. MOZ-TIF2 directly regulates a small subset of genes encoding developmental transcription factors, augmenting their high expression. Furthermore, transcription levels in MOZ-TIF2 cells positively correlate with enrichment of histone H3 propionylation at lysine 23 (H3K23pr), a recently appreciated histone acylation associated with gene activation. Unexpectedly, we also show that MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AF9 regulate transcription of unique gene sets, and their cellular models exhibit distinct sensitivities to multiple small-molecule inhibitors directed against AML pathways. This is despite the shared genetic pathways of wild-type MOZ and MLL. Overall, our data provide insight into how aberrant regulation of MOZ contributes to leukemogenesis. We anticipate that these experiments will inform future work identifying targeted therapies in the treatment of AML and other diseases involving MOZ-induced transcriptional dysregulation."
