  "abstract_text": "The apolipoprotein E (apoE) type 4 allele (APOE4) is a susceptibility gene for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer disease. ApoE is found in some neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons, one of the major pathologic hallmarks of the disease. Neurofibrillary tangles contain paired helical filaments formed from hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. In vitro, tau binds avidly to apoE3, but not to apoE4, forming a bimolecular complex. Tau phosphorylated with a brain extract does not bind either isoform. ApoE3 binds to the microtubule-binding repeat region of tau, which is also the region that is thought to cause self-assembly into the paired helical filament. Binding studies with fragments of ApoE demonstrate that the tau-binding region of apoE3 corresponds to its receptor-binding domain and is distinct from the region that binds lipoprotein particles or beta/A4 peptide. Isoform-specific interactions of apoE with tau may regulate intraneuronal tau metabolism in Alzheimer disease and alter the rate of formation of paired helical filaments and neurofibrillary tangles.",
