    "abstract_text": "<h4>Objective</h4>Partial androgen insensitivity syndromes are the cause of genital ambiguity that is at times quite severe; there is, therefore, a high demand for prenatal diagnosis in families already afflicted with this syndrome. When the mutation has not been identified, the diagnosis can be made by the study of the polymorphisms of the androgen receptor gene. To perform molecular prenatal diagnosis in a family with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, we studied the Hind III polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene on the trophoblastic DNA. The use of this restriction fragment length polymorphism tracked maternal X chromosome segregation and established prenatal diagnosis although the mutation had not yet been identified in this family. FAMILY: The mother had been previously described as heterozygous for the Hind III polymorphism and chromosomal segregation analysis showed that the affected allele was associated with the 6.7-kb Hind III fragment.<h4>Measurements</h4>Hind III RFLP with an androgen receptor gene cDNA probe was realized on the trophoblastic DNA, along with measurement of androgen binding activity on the trophoblastic cells.<h4>Results</h4>We detected the presence of the 6.7-kb fragment in the DNA of the trophoblastic cells suggesting the fetus was affected. Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome was confirmed by a considerable decrease in androgen binding activity on the trophoblastic cells and by sonography of the fetus. After a therapeutic abortion requested by the parents, the diagnosis was confirmed by clinical examination of the fetus, biochemical analyses of the fetal androgen receptor, and molecular studies of the fetal DNA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>When the mutation of the androgen receptor gene has not been identified, Hind III polymorphism of the trophoblastic DNA is useful in the prenatal diagnosis of androgen insensitivity syndrome in high-risk families.",
