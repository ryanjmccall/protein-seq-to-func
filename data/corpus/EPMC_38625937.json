Significance Insulin maintains glucose homeostasis, and the insulin-resistant condition is when the cells have impaired insulin response, which can further progress to type 2 diabetes. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR) to trigger phosphorylations on multiple IR and IRS-1 tyrosines for myriad of cellular responses. However, serine and threonine phosphorylations in insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) are well known in the insulin-resistant state. In this study, we demonstrate how a certain IRS-1 region encompassing four serines in its unphosphorylated state enhances insulin signaling by binding to the IRK, and by inhibiting the phosphatase mediating the IR dephosphorylation. We suggest that the serines in the phosphorylated state reverse these effects, which would in turn desensitize insulin signaling and confer insulin resistance. Serine phosphorylations on insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) by diverse kinases aoccur widely during obesity-, stress-, and inflammation-induced conditions in models of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we define a region within the human IRS-1, which is directly C-terminal to the PTB domain encompassing numerous serine phosphorylation sites including Ser307 (mouse Ser302) and Ser312 (mouse 307) creating a phosphorylation insulin resistance (PIR) domain. We demonstrate that the IRS-1 PTB-PIR with its unphosphorylated serine residues interacts with the insulin receptor (IR) but loses the IR-binding when they are phosphorylated. Surface plasmon resonance studies further confirm that the PTB-PIR binds stronger to IR than just the PTB domain, and that phosphorylations at Ser307, Ser312, Ser315, and Ser323 within the PIR domain result in abrogating the binding. Insulin-responsive cells containing the mutant IRS-1 with all these four serines changed into glutamates to mimic phosphorylations show decreased levels of phosphorylations in IR, IRS-1, and AKT compared to the wild-type IRS-1. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments indicating the PIR domain interacting with the N-terminal lobe and the hinge regions of the IR kinase domain further suggest the possibility that the IRS-1 PIR domain protects the IR from the PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation. serine phosphorylation IRS-1 insulin receptor insulin resistance diabetes National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) 501100003725 RS-2023-00243435 SangYoun Park National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) 501100003725 2021R1A6A1A10044154 SangYoun Park Insulin signaling is the pathway for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and insulin resistance is a condition typified by desensitization to insulin and the impairment in insulin-mediated regulation. Insulin resistance is a critical state in the development of type 2 diabetes and is also associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, and other chronic diseases ( 1 , 2 ). Numerous inducers of insulin resistance include hyperinsulinemia, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) ( 3 – 5 ), FFAs ( 6 ), ER- and oxidative-stress ( 7 , 8 ), as well as obesity ( 9 ), and in all these cases, Ser/Thr phosphorylations in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) have been pointed out as the common cause resulting in the negatively regulated signaling ( 10 ). The IRS family proteins share the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, and the multiple tyrosine residues C-terminal to the two domains, which are phosphorylated by the insulin receptor (IR) ( 11 ). Direct interaction between the IRS PTB domain and the NPXpY motif of the IR juxtamembrane region (pY stands for phosphorylated tyrosine; pY960 for mouse IR and pY972 for human IR) facilities the insulin-triggered action of IR kinase to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on IRS ( 12 , 13 ), and the phosphotyrosine residues subsequently propagate the insulin signal by recruiting further downstream protein such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) for phosphorylation. In contrast to the tyrosine phosphorylations, Ser/Thr phosphorylations of IRS-1 (which is mostly studied among the IRS family proteins) are involved in the negative feedback regulation of the insulin action. For example, the negative regulation of the insulin signaling pathway by JNK1 is observed both in the hepatocytes of calorie-restricted Ob/Ob mice which have decreased JNK1-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation ( 14 ), and in the adipose tissue–specific JNK1 deficient mice which showed suppressed insulin resistance and decreased adiposity upon high fat diet (HFD) ( 15 ). Moreover, ER stress resulting from obesity has been correlated with the induction of IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and the decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation ( 16 ), and treatment of JNK1 inhibitor reversed these effects ( 17 ). One of the known insulin resistance mechanisms mediated by serine phosphorylation is that near the IRS-1 pYMPM motif (SH2 domain docking site), which results in blocking the interaction between IRS-1 and the SH2 domain-containing PI3K p85 regulatory subunit ( 18 ). Another established mechanism is through the targeted degradation of IRS-1 by proteasome, where CUL7 or SOCS1/3 E3 ligase complex recognizes the IRS-1 phosphoserine to consequently recruit the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome complex for degradation ( 19 , 20 ). Especially, phosphoserine in IRS-1 regions of 386 to 430 is reported to be responsible for insulin-induced proteasomal degradation of IRS-1 ( 21 ). As the IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylations are highly increased in obese or insulin-resistant models, various Ser/Thr kinases and phosphatases have been associated to mediate insulin signaling by disrupting the IR and IRS-1 interaction ( 22 , 23 ). For example, PKCζ, a downstream effector of PI3K, prevents the interaction of IR and IRS-1 via phosphorylation of mouse IRS-1 Ser318 in response to a prolonged insulin stimulus ( 24 , 25 ). In another report, an increased activity of S6K1 and the resulting phosphorylations of mouse Ser302 and Ser632/635 were highly elevated in high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin-resistant model ( 26 ). Also, phosphorylations of IRS-1 Ser302 and Ser307 are significantly increased in the hepatocytes of both HFD-induced and Ob/Ob mice ( 26 ), and the yeast trihybrid (Y3H) studies show that JNK1 directly phosphorylates Ser302 or Ser307 to result in the blocking of IRS-1 and IR interaction ( 27 ). It is worthwhile at this moment to note that the multiple serine residues such as the aforementioned Ser302, Ser307, and Ser318 sites, all known to undergo for phosphorylation, are clustered together in the IRS-1 sequence. Apart from the JNK1, elevated plasma TNF-α levels also activate IKKβ which has been linked to the obesity-mediated insulin resistance ( 28 ), and IKKβ has been shown to phosphorylate the IRS-1 Ser307 when in complex with other required components such as the IKKγ and Myo1c ( 29 ). As expected, muscle-specific IRS-1 transgenic mice of all Ser302, Ser307, and Ser612 to Ala residues show increased glucose uptake in muscle and have improved fat-induced insulin resistance ( 30 ). Again, many studies have demonstrated that the serine phosphorylations at the proximal sites C-terminal to the PTB domain are necessary to negatively regulate the insulin signaling pathway and that the phosphorylations are performed in a combinatorial fashion by multiple Ser/Thr kinases ( 31 – 33 ), but it is still unclear which of these phosphorylated serine residues are critical and how they are involved in the inhibition of insulin signaling at the molecular level. Historically, the stably folding PTB domain (human IRS-1 residues 160 to 263) of IRS-1 has been identified to be essential for the interaction with IR ( 34 – 36 ). In this paper, we define the region C-terminal to this PTB domain as the P hosphorylation I nsulin R esistance (PIR) domain (IRS-1 residues 264 to 340) which contains the multiple serine residues known to undergo phosphorylation. In vitro pull-down experiments as well as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments show that the PIR domain enhances the IRS-1 interaction with IR, and that the phosphorylations at human IRS-1 residues of Ser307 (mouse Ser302), Ser312 (mouse Ser307), Ser315 (mouse Ser310), and Ser323 (mouse Ser318) weaken the IR affinity. Of note, all sequence numbers of IR and IRS-1 in this paper hereafter are written for that of humans. Additionally, the PIR domain prevents the IR from undergoing PTB1B-mediated dephosphorylation, while serine phosphorylations at the PIR domain abrogate the protective effect. Finally, the binding mode analysis using the hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) specifies the region within the IR kinase domain that interacts with the PIR domain. Results IRS-1 Serine Phosphorylation within the PIR Domain Does Not Alter the IR pY972 and IRS-1 PTB Domain Interaction. To identify the role of IRS-1 serine phosphorylations within the IRS-1 PIR domain, we first tested whether the serine phosphorylated PIR domain impedes the direct interaction between the IRS-1 PTB domain and the IR juxtamembrane phosphotyrosine (pY972). By using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we measured and compared the binding affinities (K D ) between the IR juxtamembrane pY972 peptide (LYASSNPApYLSASDV, note that the sequence NPAY972 instead of the wild-type NPEY972 is for enhanced PTB-binding) and the various Escherichia coli -expressed PTB domain containing constructs of IRS-1 (PTB domain by itself and PTB-PIR domain including the phosphoserine (pSer) version of the protein as well as the serine-to-glutamate mutant proteins to mimic serine phosphorylations) ( SI Appendix , Figs. S1 and S2 ). Since it has been reported that human Ser307 (mouse Ser302) and Ser312 (mouse Ser307) sites are not sufficient to disrupt the IR and IRS-1 interaction, and that additional serine phosphorylations are required to disrupt their interaction ( 27 ), we have also included the human Ser323 (mouse Ser318) phosphorylated by PKCζ as part of the phosphoserine set tested. Furthermore, we have added the in-between human Ser315 (mouse Ser310) to this set as well in order to test the cumulative phosphorylation effect. Although never been reported, studies in our lab using the phosphoserine-specific antibody suggest that this serine is indeed phosphorylated in various Ser/Thr kinase activator-treated CHO cells as well as in an obese model mouse. Expressed protein ligation (EPL) was used to generate the multiple pSer extension C-terminal to the PTB domain (as listed in SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). The interaction between the PTB domain and the IR pY972 peptide has been already reported with a K D ~μM affinity measured by ITC ( 37 ). Our measured affinity between the PTB domain and the IR pY972 peptide had a similar binding (K D ~ 3.0 μm) as previously reported ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). Also, the binding affinity between PTB-PIR and IR pY972 peptide was similar to that of the PTB domain alone. Further ITC results indicated that the IR pY972 peptide bound to all the EPL-generated phosphoserine proteins—even to the multiple pSer version of PTB-PIR with pSer307/312/315/323—with similar affinities as for the unphosphorylated PTB-PIR (K D ~ 2 μm). Moreover, all serine-to-glutamate mutants of PTB-PIR designed to mimic the serine phosphorylations had similar overall affinities as well. Hence, the overall ITC results suggest that the IRS-1 PIR domain does not have any effect on the interaction between the IR pY972 peptide and the PTB domain, and that the serine phosphorylations of the PIR domain do not interfere with the pY972-mediated IR and IRS-1 PTB domain interaction. Extension of the IRS-1 PIR Domain to PTB Domain Enhances Interaction to IR while the Serine Phosphorylations Critically Reduce the Interaction. Knowing that the IRS-1 PIR domain does not directly affect the IR juxtamembrane pY972 and the IRS-1 PTB domain binding, we next tested to see whether the PIR domain has any role in the interaction between the IRS-1 PTB domain and the IR pY972-extended with the IR kinase domain (IR residues 962−1283, the juxtamembrane sequence in this case is also of NPAY972 for enhanced PTB-binding). The IRK protein expressed using SF9 insect cells was purified and was auto-phosphorylated on four tyrosine residues (IR juxtamembrane Y972 and Y1158/Y1162/Y1163 on the activation loop of IRK; pY972-IRK) followed by incubation with either the PTB domain alone or PTB-PIR. The complexed proteins were purified on an anion exchanger (MonoQ) and were further analyzed by a native gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 1 A ). Both complexes had two major MonoQ elution peaks indicative of the two different phosphorylated states of pY972-IRK (4pY and 3pY, see below), and the electrophoresis result further confirmed the four tyrosine phosphorylated state (4pY of Peak 2) and the three tyrosine phosphorylated state (3pY of Peak 1) ( Fig. 1 A ) with 4pY showing faster mobility than 3pY (Of note, the phosphotyrosine contents of 3pY is not yet clear.). As judged from the peak heights of 4pY (Peak 2) and 3pY (Peak 1) in the MonoQ chromatograms, the pY972-IRK in complex with the PTB domain alone showed more relative amount of 3pY vs. 4pY in comparison to the PTB-PIR complex suggesting more spontaneous dephosphorylation ( Fig. 1 A ). Therefore, the results led us to suppose that the IRS-1 PIR domain interacts with the IR to protect against dephosphorylation, and that perhaps the serine phosphorylation attenuates effect. Fig. 1. The binding affinity of the PTB-PIR domain to IR disappeared upon multiserine phosphorylation of the PIR domain. ( A ) MonoQ chromatography profiles of pY972-IRK in complex either with PTB domain alone (red) or with PTB-PIR domain (blue) are shown. “Peak 1” and “Peak 2” correspond to the three tyrosine phosphorylated (3pY) and four tyrosine phosphorylated (4pY) states of pY972-IRK, respectively, which were confirmed using native gel electrophoresis on the pY972-IRK:PTB complex. The elution fractions corresponding to the gel lanes are indicated on the chromatogram. ( B ) Pull-down experiments were performed with various IRS-1 PTB domain-containing proteins on the lysates of the insulin-stimulated full-length IR-expressing CHO (CHO IR ) cell. The purified IRS-1 PTB-PIR, PTB-PIR 4E, PTB-4pSer, and PTB protein with His-tag were immobilized using anti-His antibody bead, mixed with the cell lysates, washed, and the contents detected with anti-His and anti-IR antibodies ( Left ). After quantification of the blotting for three individual experiments with normalization over the strongest bound IR result for the PTB-PIR domain set to 1, the mean binding fold differences are plotted ( Right ). Error bars indicate +SEM, and statistical analysis was calculated with a one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni’s test. All PTB-PIR vs. PTB-PIR 4E, PTB-4pSer, and PTB have * P < 0.0001. ( C ) The effects of glutamate mutant in PIR domain on the IR pull-down experiment are shown. Similar to ( B ), the IR expressed in the CHO IR cells were immunoprecipitated with purified PTB-PIR domain (144 to 340) containing various serine-to-glutamate mutants of S307E, S312E, S315E and 4E (S307/312/315/323E). The purified PIR domain proteins all had a Flag-tag which was used to mobilize to the beads using an anti-Flag antibody. The proteins were detected with anti-IR and anti-Flag antibodies ( Left ). After quantification of the blotting for three individual experiments with normalization over the bound IR of wild-type PTB-PIR domain used as positive control, the mean binding fold differences are plotted ( Right ). The error bars indicate +SEM, and statistical analysis was calculated with a one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni’s test where PTB-PIR domain WT vs. 4E shows * P < 0.0001. To further test this hypothesis at the level of the activated full-length wild-type IR, we performed experiments using the E. coli -expressed IRS-1 PTB-containing proteins to pull down the IR from the insulin-stimulated CHO IR cells (Unlike the previously used recombinant pY972-IRK containing the NPAY972 juxtamembrane sequence, IR of the insulin-stimulated CHO IR cells have the native NPEY972 IR sequence.). As expected, the IRS-1 PTB-PIR domain only pulled down the insulin-stimulated wild-type IR and not the Y972F IR ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 A ). However, the IRS-1 PTB domain alone was not able to pull down the activated IR as efficiently as the PTB-PIR domain ( Fig. 1 B ). The IRS-1 PTB domain alone not being able to pull down IR may result from the phosphorylated IR juxtamembrane region with the wild-type NPEpY972 sequence having a lower binding (K D ~ 87 μm, ref. 37 ) to the IRS-1 PTB domain than the IR juxtamembrane peptide of NPApY972 used in our ITC study. In any case, because the K D values from the ITC data showed that the PTB domain alone and the PTB-PIR had no significant difference in their binding affinity to the IR pY972 peptide ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ), it can be concluded that the PIR domain must be contributing to the overall effective IR interaction. Additionally, the PIR domain alone was not able to pull down the IR ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 B ). At the same time, we examined whether serine phosphorylation in the PTB-PIR would disrupt the IR and IRS-1 interaction. When tested with the EPL-generated phosphoserine protein (PTB-4pSer) or the multiphosphoserine mimicking PTB-PIR 4E (S307/312/315/323E) for the pull-down, it was evident that the affinity of PTB-PIR to the IR gets abrogated upon phosphorylation ( Fig. 1 B ). Moreover, such abrogation in binding to IR was not observed in the single serine-to-glutamate PTB-PIR mutants ( Fig. 1 C ). All single mutants S307E, S312E, and S315E of PTB-PIR showed no difference in binding to IR when compared with the wild-type PTB-PIR domain (Of note, the S323E PTB-PIR mutant was not tested due to low expression level and instability.). These data indicate that a single serine phosphorylation at the IRS-1 PIR domain is insufficient to block the IRS-1 and IR binding, which is consistent with the previous Y3H results ( 27 ). Taken together, our data suggest that 1) in conjunction with the IRS-1 PTB domain, the PIR domain is also an IR interaction domain which is necessary for high IR affinity, and 2) multisite rather than single serine site phosphorylation in the IRS-1 PIR domain disrupts the IR and IRS-1 interaction. The IRS-1 PIR Domain Interacts with IR Cooperatively with the IRS-1 PTB Domain. Having qualitative evidence that the PIR domain enhances the overall IRS-1 interaction to IR, we further tested to confirm this by carrying out immunoblot competition assays. In this experiment, we utilized the Flag-tag to immobilize the E. coli -expressed IRS-1 PTB-PIR-Flag protein with the IR obtained from the insulin-stimulated CHO IR cells (IR:PTB-PIR-Flag). For competitors, PTB-PIR without the Flag-tag, IR pY972 peptide, PTB domain alone, and PIR domain alone have been used, and their IC 50 quantified ( Fig. 2 ). When the competitor PTB-PIR without the Flag-tag was added to the IR:PTB-PIR-Flag mixture, the bound IR decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner (55 nM ~ 1.9 μm) ( Fig. 2 A ). For example, the presence of 1 μm PTB-PIR resulted in a decreased PTB-PIR-Flag and IR binding to only 20% of their original binding ( Fig. 2 B ), and the calculated IC 50 was 0.23 μm ( Fig. 2 C ). Likewise, both the IR pY972 peptide and the PTB domain alone reduced the PTB-PIR-Flag and IR binding with concentration dependence (3.3 ~ 333 μm). However, inferred from the IC 50 values, the PTB-PIR was 170-fold and 80-fold more effective in binding to IR compared to the IR pY972 peptide and PTB domain alone, respectively ( Fig. 2 B and C ). Consistent with the PIR domain alone not pulling-down IR ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 B ), the PIR domain alone did not show any inhibitory effects on the IR:PTB-PIR-Flag interaction even at ~mM concentration ( Fig. 2 A ). Hence, it is reasonable to believe that the IRS-1 PIR domain alone is not as efficient as the PTB domain for interacting with IR, and that it works cooperatively with the PTB domain for IR interaction. Fig. 2. The PTB-PIR domain bound to the IR was subjected to competition using various proteins. ( A ) The purified Flag-tagged PTB-PIR domain was mixed with the insulin-stimulated CHO IR cell lysates. At the same time, the PTB-PIR, PTB, PIR proteins (all without the Flag-tag) and the IR pY972 peptide (LYASSNPApYLSASDV) were added into the mix. The binding IR was immunoprecipitated on anti-Flag antibody and immunoblotted with anti-IR and anti-Flag antibodies. The anti-Flag immunoblot below indicates the equal amount of Flag-PTB-PIR protein in the mixture. The bound-IR immunoprecipitated with PTB-PIR-Flag without any added competitor was set as the positive control ( Far Left lane ) which was used to compare with every competition conditions. Concentrations of the competitors used are indicated above. ( B ) Four separate sets of competition experiments were performed and the bound-IRs quantified for each concentration. Inhibition plots for the different competitors [PTB-PIR (♦), pY972 (▲), PTB (◻), and PIR (◻)] are drawn with the x-axis in Log-scaled molar concentration. Error bars indicate ±SEM. ( C ) The IC 50 (the competitor concentration where 50% of bound-IR occurs) values were estimated from the plot ( B ) of bound-IR (%) vs. Log (competitor concentration). Taken together, the higher concentrations of both IR pY972 peptide and PTB domain alone necessary to inhibit the IR:PTB-PIR-Flag interaction when compared to the PTB-PIR as a competitor, again suggest that the PIR domain enhances the PTB domain interaction to IR. Moreover, the IC 50 of PTB-PIR being 80-fold lower than the PTB domain alone suggests that the PIR domain contributes toward the stronger overall IRS-1 and IR interaction in conjunction with the PTB domain and the IR pY972 interaction. The Direct Binding of PTB-PIR to pTyr972 IRK Is Measured Using SPR. Having found that the IRS-1 PIR domain binds to IR together with the PTB domain, we sought out to determine the quantitative binding affinities between the various PIR domain-containing proteins and the pY972-IRK. To measure the binding affinities between the two recombinantly expressed proteins, we have exploited the method of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) rather than the previously used ITC ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). For the SPR experiments, various PIR domain-containing proteins expressed from the E. coli were used as the analytes and the activated pY972-IRK (IR residues 962 to 1283) generated from the insect cell–expressed protein was used as the ligand. Note again that the pY972-IRK contains the NPAY972 juxtamembrane sequence intended for enhanced PTB domain binding. The interaction between pY972-IRK and the PTB domain showed an affinity (K D = 1.6 μm) ( Fig. 3 ) which was very similar to the ITC-measured value of 3.0 μm using the IR pY972 peptide ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). However, the PTB-PIR binds to the pY972-IRK with 40-fold higher binding affinity (K D = 0.04 μm) than the PTB domain alone. (Of note, reverse experiments which used pY972-IRK as an analyte and the PTB domain and the PTB-PIR as ligands gave consistent K D values). When the pY972-IRK binding sensorgrams of the PTB domain and PTB-PIR were compared, they had different association and dissociation patterns ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 A and B ). The PTB domain had both fast on-rate (k a ) and off-rate (k d ) compared to that of PTB-PIR. Although both k a and k d values were decreased in the case of PTB-PIR, the substantially slow off-rate resulted in the overall lower K D (=k d /k a ) value of 0.04 μm. Moreover, the multiserine phosphorylation forms of the PTB-PIR – namely the PTB-4pSer and the PTB-PIR 4E—had eightfold and fivefold decreased pY972-IRK binding affinities than the PTB-PIR, respectively. However, the binding affinities of the PTB-4pSer and the PTB-PIR 4E domain to pY972-IRK were still fivefold and eightfold respectively stronger than the PTB domain alone. It is interesting that the PIR domain alone even bound to the pY972-IRK with a K D of 1.3 μm which was comparable to the binding of PTB domain alone. This was surprising given that the PIR domain alone was not able to pull down IR ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 B ) and that the PIR domain alone did not show any inhibitory effects to compete for the preexisting IR:PTB–PIR interaction ( Fig. 2 ). In contrast to the wild-type PIR domain alone, the serine phosphorylation mimic (serine-to-glutamate mutant) of the PIR domain had relatively no pY972-IRK binding (~mM K D ). From these results, we conclude that the PTB domain and the PIR domain are able to interact with the IR in a cooperative fashion to enhance the total binding between the IR and IRS-1. The overall results also indicate that the serine phosphorylation on the PIR domain abrogates the IR and IRS-1 interaction. Fig. 3. Binding affinities between various IRS-1 PTB or PIR protein and pY972-IRK were measured using SPR. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) was used to measure the affinities (K D ) between various IRS-1 PTB domain (or PIR domain) proteins and the phosphorylated pY972-IRK (962 to 1283) expressed using insect cells. The IRS-1 proteins used for the experiment are indicated with residue boundaries. The representative SPR sensorgrams in each case are shown in SI Appendix , Fig. S4 . The IRS-1 PIR Domain Protects IR against the PTP1B-Mediated Dephosphorylation. The enhanced IRS-1 binding to IR through both the PTB and PIR domains would be expected to promote the IRK-mediated multisite tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 further propagating the downstream effect of insulin. Additionally, we tested whether the cooperative IR-binding by PTB-PIR protects the IR from dephosphorylation especially since we had already seen evidence for this protective effect previously during the purification of the PTB-PIR:pY972-IRK complex on MonoQ ( Fig. 1 A ). To quantitatively address the protective role of the PIR domain on IR against a phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation, we performed a time-dependent in vitro dephosphorylation experiment by adding PTP1B into the mixtures of IR obtained from the insulin-stimulated CHO IR cells and the various IRS-1 PTB domain-containing proteins. The fact that the dephosphorylation of IR takes place only upon the added PTP1B in the short time scale of our experiment was verified by using PTP1B and the PTP1B-specific inhibitor ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 A ). The phosphorylation states of the IR tyrosine residues (pY972, pY1162/1163, and pY1334) were then monitored using immunoblot ( Fig. 4 A ). Fig. 4. The IRS-1 PIR domain protected IR from PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation. ( A ) Purified IR from the insulin-stimulated CHO IR cells was incubated with either PTB, PTB-PIR, or PTB-PIR 4E (10 min) in the presence of 5 ng/μL PTP1B. At the indicated times (0, 5, 20, and 40 min), aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture to perform immunoblotting with anti-pY1162/1163, anti-pY972, and anti-pY antibodies. ( B ) Quantifications of the immunoblot were performed for three independent experiments to monitor the time-dependent change in the IR phosphorylation state with time 0 set to the 100% initial phosphorylation level. Asterisks indicate * P < 0.001 calculated by the two-way ANOVA method. ( C ) The mean half-life ( τ ½ ) of phosphorylation was estimated from the plot ( B ), which is shown with +SEM (error bar). Statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed, unpaired method. When compared to the PTB alone, the PTB-PIR value had * P < 0.0001. The two phosphotyrosines, pY1162/1163, in the activation loop of the IRK domain is a well-known substrate of PTP1B. In the IR:PTB complex, the two residues were rapidly dephosphorylated to retain 20% (in 5 min) and 5% (in 20 min) of the initial pY level. However, the phosphorylation states of pY1162/1163 in the IR:PTB-PIR complex were relatively protected with 65% (in 5 min) and 15% (in 20 min) of the pY still remaining ( Fig. 4 A and B ). The dephosphorylation rate of pY1162/1163 in the IR:PTB-PIR 4E complex was very similar to the IR:PTB complex, which again may result from the loss of the IR interaction from the phosphoserine-mimicking serine-to-glutamate mutation in the PIR domain. Hence, from these experiments, it can be concluded that the PIR domain binding to the IR can somewhat delay the rapid dephosphorylation of pY1162/1163 by PTP1B. Interestingly, the presence of PTB-PIR domain with IR also caused a retardation in the pY972 dephosphorylation ( Fig. 4 A and B ). Indeed, the dephosphorylation of pY972 was slower in all complexes compared to that of pY1162/1163 likely reflecting that the preferred target of PTB1B is pY1162/1163. Nevertheless, the phosphorylation level of pY972 in the IR:PTB-PIR complex was retained up to 75% (in 5 min) and 35% (in 20 min) of the initial level. However, in both IR complexes of either PTB domain or PTB-PIR 4E, the pY972 was dephosphorylated faster only to retain 45% (in 5 min) and 30% (in 20 min) of the initial pY level. Also, the total pY detection in IR reflected that the IRS-1 PIR domain somewhat protects IR against dephosphorylation ( Fig. 4 A and B ). Interestingly, the dephosphorylation of pY1334 (located at the C-terminal end of IRK) by PTP1B was happening at a faster time-scale than the other phosphotyrosine residues ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 B − D ). Nevertheless, the IR:PTB-PIR complex also had a similar tendency to delay the IR dephosphorylation on the pY1334 as in other phosphotyrosines. When the relative half-life (τ ½ ) values of the experiments were compared ( Fig. 4 C ), it became more evident that the PTB-PIR markedly delays the PTP1B-mediated IR dephosphorylations of pY1162/1163 and pY972 compared to the PTB or the PTB-PIR 4E. These results together suggest that the PIR domain binding to IR acts to sustain and increase the overall phosphotyrosines necessary for the activation of IR and the subsequent propagation of downstream insulin action. Again, the results indicate that the serine phosphorylations on the PIR domain would negatively affect the ongoing insulin signal by abolishing the protective role on IR against dephosphorylation. The serine phosphorylations mimicked by changing all four serines of the PIR domain into glutamates in full-length IRS-1 had a negatively effect on insulin signal pathway in cell-based studies as well ( Fig. 5 ). Upon insulin stimulation of CHO IR cells transfected with IRS-1 WT and 4E mutant, the 4E mutant showed significantly low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in IR (pY972, pY1162/1163, and Total pY) ( Fig. 5 A ) compared to the WT IRS-1 (65 to 76% of the WT level). Also for the IRS-1 4E mutant transfected cell, the total tyrosine phosphorylation level of IRS-1 (56% of the WT level) ( Fig. 5 B ) and the further downstream phospho-AKT (43% of the WT level) ( Fig. 5 C ) decreased significantly compared to the WT IRS-1 attesting to the fact that the phosphorylation of the PIR domain negatively affects insulin signaling even at the cell level. Fig. 5. The full-length IRS-1 4E mutant of the PIR domain has negative insulin signaling effects in CHO IR cells. ( A ) Upon insulin stimulation in IRS-1 WT and 4E mutant transfected CHO IR cells, 4E mutant showed decreased levels of phosphorylation in IR (pY972, pY1162/1163, and Total pY) compared to the WT. The levels of phospho-IR were normalized using the amount of total input protein. ( B ) When the FLAG-tagged IRS-1 was immuno-precipitated using anti-FLAG antibody in WT or 4E mutant IRS-1 transfected cells, the total pY level of IRS-1 was also low for the 4E mutant IRS-1 cells. The levels of the pY for IRS-1 were normalized using the amount of FLAG detected. ( C ) The level of phospho-AKT over AKT also dropped in the 4E mutant compared to the WT. All quantified values in the graph represent means ± SD from three independent experiments with P -values (*** P < 0.001; ** P < 0.01; * P < 0.05). The IRS-1 PIR Domain Interacts with the N-terminal Lobe and the Hinge Region of IRK. HDX-MS is a powerful and a well-established method for characterizing protein–protein interactions in a protein complex. As the previous SPR experiments suggested that the PIR domain interacts directly with the pY972-IRK, we performed the HDX-MS experiment in order to examine the interacting region within the pY972-IRK. Since previous results ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 A and B and Fig. 2 ) indicated that the PTB-PIR rather than PIR alone interacts most efficiently with the IRK, hydrogen to deuterium exchange levels of pY972-IRK (962 to 1283) in the pY972-IRK:PTB-PIR complex were compared against that of the pY972-IRK by itself. As in a typical HDX-MS experiment, decreased deuterium levels would result from the PIR domain protecting the interacting surface of pY972-IRK conferring less accessibility to the added D 2 O. The entire MS signal covered 84% of total residues of pY972-IRK, and five pY972-IRK regions had significantly reduced deuterium levels in the pY972-IRK:PTB-PIR complex when compared to the pY972-IRK alone ( Fig. 6 A ). As expected, one of the significantly low deuterium regions was near the NPXpY motif of the pY972-IRK (residues 985 to 989), which interacts with the PTB domain. Unfortunately, peptide encompassing pY972 was not detected in the study. The other four significantly low deuterium regions corresponded to the IRK regions of β2 (residues 1008 to 1025), β3 (residues 1024 to 1038), the hinge region of αC-β4 (residues 1045 to 1073), and the helix αJ (residues 1269 to 1273) at the C-terminus, suggesting that these regions interact with the IRS-1 PIR domain. Fig. 6. The HDX-MS identified the PIR domain-interacting regions in the IRK domain. ( A ) Each plot shows the deuterium exchange levels for a representative peptide fragment detected (with noted boundary) at different time points (10 s, 10 min, 1 h, and 3 h) after D 2 O mixing. The y - axis maximum corresponds to the theoretical maximum amount of deuterium that could be incorporated into the region. When all the other detected peptide fragments were analyzed, only five pY972-IRK regions with significant hydrogen-to-deuterium differences between pY972-IRK alone (blue) and in complex with PTB-PIR domain (red) were found. These five regions corresponded to the C-terminal proximity of the NPXpY972 motif, β2, β3, the hinge region of αC-β4, and the helix αJ. ( B ) The suggested PIR domain-interacting regions in IRK are shown (red) over the crystal structure of human IRK (PDB code 1IR3). When these four regions were identified on the crystal structure of human IRK (PDB code 1IR3) (red in Fig. 6 B ), they form a concave surface enclosed by the N-lobe (β2, β3, and β4), the hinge (αC-β4) and the helix αJ, which is located opposite to the activation loop. It is interesting to note that the complex crystal structure of IRK and the PTP1B catalytic domain have revealed that the PTP1B also binds to the IRK away from the activation loop ( 38 ) by using the IRK interface composed of the β2-β3 loop and the helix αJ. Discussion The insulin signaling cascade controls glucose intake into cells, and insulin resistance is a condition when cells do not respond to insulin. Insulin resistance is involved in many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes and even in neurodegenerative diseases ( 1 ). Considering the population of obese and elderly people increasing, modern men are more likely to suffer from insulin resistance in one way or another. Among the various pathways leading to insulin resistance, the serine phosphorylations in IRS-1 are well known, and because some notable serine phosphorylation sites (human IRS-1 Ser307/312/323) are clustered at the C-terminal region of the PTB domain (IRS-1 residues 160−263), a common belief was that phosphorylations in these serines may directly block the IR juxtamembrane pY972 from interacting with the IRS-1 PTB domain. However, our ITC data clearly disproved this notion that the serine phosphorylations disturb the interaction between the IRS-1 PTB domain and the IR pY972 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). In the subsequent results, we have learned that another IR-binding site in IRS-1 other than the well-known PTB domain – here named the PIR domain (IRS-1 residues 264 to 340)—provides an insight for understanding the serine phosphorylation-mediated insulin resistance. Since we believe that the clustered serines and their phosphorylations are important in desensitizing insulin signaling, we have limited our definition of the PIR domain to include the most classically known phosphorylation sites of mouse IRS-1 Ser302/307/318 (human IRS-1 Ser307/312/323). However, since other nearby phosphorylation undergoing serines such as the mouse IRS-1 Ser332/336 (human IRS-1 Ser337/341, ref. 39 ) and mouse IRS-1 Ser357 (human IRS-1 Ser362, ref. 40 ) are known to exist, the boundary of the PIR domain may extend farther C-terminal to our defined region. Our data suggest that the PIR domain attached to the PTB domain enhances the overall affinity of IRS-1 to IR. Surprisingly in the SPR experiment, the PIR alone bound to pY972-IRK with ~μM K D affinity which was similar to as PTB did ( Fig. 3 ). This was contradictory to the observation that the PIR alone was not able to impede the interaction between the full-length IR (from whole cell lysate) and PTB-PIR unlike in the case for the PTB ( Fig. 2 ). This discrepancy between the SPR measurement and the competition assay may result from using only the partial IR (pY972-IRK) in the SPR experiment. Hence, it is likely that in the context of full-length IR in the cell, the PIR would not have such high affinity to the IR as observed in the SPR experiment. Most importantly, the serine phosphorylations in the PIR domain resulted in lessening the overall interaction between IR and IRS-1 ( Figs. 1 – 3 ). Even at the cell level, cells with serine phosphorylations of the IRS-1 PIR domain mimicked by switching them to glutamates showed overall decreases in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of both IR and IRS-1, and also in phospho-AKT with insulin stimulation ( Fig. 5 ). These results clearly give a glimpse on the molecular mechanism behind the insulin resistance which occurs from the serine phosphorylation within the PIR domain of IRS-1. It is worthwhile to note that the IRS-1 PIR domain sequences are largely conserved in the IRS-2 with the two serines corresponding to the human IRS-1 Ser307/323 being present. Moreover, the aligned IRS-2 region also contains clustered serine and threonine residues which are known to undergo phosphorylation (mouse IRS-2 Ser338/343/Thr347 where Ser343 aligns to the human IRS-1 Ser307, ref. 31 ). Hence, the PIR domain may also exist in the IRS-2 with the similar function as in IRS-1. The role of PTP1B has been well studied as a negative regulator of insulin action. For instance, in obese and insulin-resistant mice, the PTP1B expression level and mouse Ser307 phosphorylation in IRS-1 were significantly elevated ( 41 , 42 ). However, the PTP1B inhibitor-treated mice or PTP1B-deficient mice had markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 with greatly improved insulin sensitivity ( 43 ). In our following experiment, the IR in the presence of the PIR domain showed a delay in the rapid PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation of IR phosphotyrosines. The HDX-MS results further provided information that the IRK regions of the N-lobe (especially β2–β4), the hinge, and the helix αJ—all opposite to the IR activation loop—are directly involved in the IRS-1 PIR domain interaction. In fact, the IRK β2-β3 loop and the helix αJ were shown to be the interfacial region of IRK for binding to PTP1B as shown in the structure of the IRK:PTP1B complex ( 38 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). Hence, the fact that the IRS-1 PIR domain and PTP1B interacting with IR using a similar region, taken together with the result that the PIR domain protects IR from the PTB1B-mediated dephosphorylation, strongly supports that the PIR domain promotes the insulin action by not only enhancing the binding affinity between IRS-1 and IRK, but also by protecting dephosphorylation of IR phosphotyrosines possibly via blocking the PTP1B and IR interaction. Therefore, based on our data accumulated on the IRS-1 PIR domain, we propose a likely mechanism of serine phosphorylation-mediated insulin resistance ( Fig. 7 ). At the beginning of insulin signaling, insulin binding to IR leads to the auto-phosphorylations in its own tyrosines for the necessary activation. Subsequently, the IRS-1 is recruited to IR by using the cooperative binding of both the IRS-1 PTB domain and the PIR domain for multityrosine phosphorylations on the IRS-1. Because the wild-type IR pY972 juxtamembrane region (with the NPEY972 sequence instead of the NPAY972 designed for tighter PTB-binding in our ITC and SPR studies) is known to have a lower binding affinity (K D ~ 87 μm) to the PTB domain ( 37 ), the PIR domain would enhance the overall IRS-1 binding to IR for elevated downstream insulin signaling. PTP1B, a negative insulin signaling regulator, also interacts with the activated IR ( 44 ), but the affinity between the PTP1B and the phosphorylated IR is weaker (K D > 100 nM) ( 38 ) in comparison to that between IR and the PTB-PIR (K D = 40 nM, this study) ( Fig. 3 ). Thus, at the initial state, the IRS-1 would outcompete PTP1B in binding to the activated IR to accelerate multityrosine phosphorylation in IRS-1 and to protect the IR against dephosphorylation from PTP1B. However, the elevation of serine phosphorylations in the PIR domain through JNK1 and other Ser/Thr kinases would decrease the affinity of IRS-1 with the IR (K D = 320 nM, this study) ( Fig. 3 ) to result in the preferable PTP1B binding to the IR. In turn, the binding of PTP1B to IR would curtail the IR phosphotyrosine levels which are critical for the kinase activity, and hence would downregulate the insulin signaling process. Hence, the phosphorylations at the serine residues of the IRS-1 PIR domain resulting from an abnormally upregulated Ser/Thr kinases can potentially counteract the effect of insulin leading to insulin resistance. Fig. 7. Proposed mechanism of IRS-1 PIR domain phosphoserine-mediated insulin resistance. Under the normal condition, the insulin binding to the IR triggers auto-phosphorylations on multiple tyrosine residues (of which only three on the activation loop and the human IR Y972 on the juxtamembrane region are shown). The PTB domain and the PIR domain of IRS-1 respectively bind to pY972 and N-lobe/hinge region of IRK. The IRS-1 PIR domain outcompetes the PTP1B phosphatase, a negative regulator of insulin signaling, for IR-binding using the similar region for the interaction. The resulting strong IRS-1 binding to the IR as well as the protection of IR against the PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation lead to the increased tyrosine phosphorylation at the C-terminal regions of IRS-1 and promote the insulin signaling. In an insulin-resistant state, various Ser kinases abnormally increase the level of phosphoserines in the PIR domain. The phosphoserines in the PIR domain not only decrease the overall IRS-1 affinity to IRK but also allow the PTP1B access to IR. PTP1B binding to IRK promotes dephosphorylations of IR phosphotyrosine residues which is necessary for its kinase activity. The inactivation of IR consequently decreases the overall IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels to cut off the downstream insulin signaling. (The proteins and the domains are not in scale.) Materials and Methods Recombinant IR and IRS-1 Protein Preparation. A gene encoding the human IR (residues 962 to 1283, juxtamembrane region, and the kinase domain) was cloned into a pFastBac (HTa) vector, and was transformed into DH10™ Bac strain (Invitrogen). Baculovirus was generated and further amplified according to the Bac-to-Bac protocol (Invitrogen). After transfecting the baculovirus into the Sf9 insect cell-line, the expression of proteins was confirmed on SDS-PAGE. The overexpressed IR recombinant protein was purified with Ni(II)-affinity agarose (Qiagen), His 6 -tag removed by TEV treatment, and further purified using gel-filtration chromatography (AKTA FPLC). The auto-phosphorylation reaction was performed as described previously ( 45 ), and the phosphorylated IR protein (herein called the pY972-IRK) was further purified on a MonoQ anion-exchanger column (GE healthcare). There were two major peaks on the chromatogram, and the phosphorylation states of the peaks were confirmed by using native gel electrophoresis. Only the peak corresponding to the 4pY state was used for the following SPR and HDX-MS experiments. It is also important to note that this insect cell expressed IR protein had a NPAY972 instead of the wild-type NPEY972 sequence as part of the juxtamembrane region for enhanced PTB domain binding. Human IRS-1 PTB−PIR (residues 144 to 340), PTB (residues 144 to 267), and PIR (residues 264 to 340) were generated by subcloning the encoding genes into a pET28a vector modified with an addition of a TEV cleavage site. Mutants of IRS-1 (S307E, S312E, S315E, and S307/312/315/323E) were generated by using site-direct mutagenesis (Stratagene). For pull-down experiments, Flag-tag was added at the C-terminus of PTB-PIR and the His-tag was not removed. Due to not having any tyrosine or tryptophan residues, the PIR domain was introduced with one tyrosine residue at the C-terminus for protein quantification purpose: i.e., UV detection for chromatography and concentration determination. The proteins were expressed in E. coli using conventional methods and were purified on a Ni(II)-affinity agarose. The His 6 -tags were removed with TEV protease and the proteins were further purified by using gel-filtration chromatography. To obtain the IR:PTB or IR:PTB-PIR complex (exclusively for results of Fig. 1 A ), the insect cell expressed IR recombinant protein (see above) was purified to the step of gel-filtration chromatography and auto-phosphorylated to obtain the pY972-IRK (same as above). Subsequently, the pY972-IRK was incubated with either PTB or PTB-PIR domain for 30 min at 4 °C, and the complexed form purified by further gel-filtration. After concentration, the two protein complexes were subjected to MonoQ chromatography. Of note, no phosphatase inhibitor (such as sodium orthovanadate added to the IRK protein for its structural study, ref. 38 ) was used during these steps. Generation of Phosphorylated IRS-1 Protein by Chemical Ligation. IRS-1 phosphoprotein with the extended C-terminal region containing the pSer307, pSer312, pSer315, and pSer323 was generated by expressed protein ligation (EPL). Briefly, the IRS-1 construct (144 to 302) with the N-terminal His 6 -tag was subcloned into an IMPACT™-TWIN (Invitrogen) vector. The protein was expressed using E. coli , and the purified protein was reacted with 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid to induce self-cleavage of the intein that renders the target protein with a reactive C-terminal thioester. This protein was further reacted with a synthetic peptide containing the pSer307 (303 to 316, CRTEpSITAISPASM), pSer312 (303 to 316, CRTESITAIpSPASM), and pSer307/312/315/323 (303 to 327, CRTEpSITAIpSPApSMVGGKPGpSERVR). The peptides were synthesized at the Advanced Protein Technology Centre at Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada). All peptides had an N-terminal cysteine in place of the native IRS-1 Ser303 for the ligation reaction. The final ligated phosphoprotein was confirmed on SDS-PAGE by changes in molecular weights, by further immunoblotting with a phosphoserine antibody, and also by mass spectrometry analysis. Affinity Measurement by ITC and SPR. Calorimetric measurements were carried out by using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (GE Healthcare) at 22 °C. Before the titration, protein samples were dialyzed against a gel filtration buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with 10 mM DTT. The IR juxtamembrane pY972 peptide (LYASSNPApYLSASDV) was ordered from Quality Controlled Biochemicals (QCB). The lyophilized peptide was dissolved in the same gel filtration buffer used for dialysis. The ITC measurements were carried out using 30 to 120 μm of the protein concentrations and 0.5 to 2.0 mM peptide concentrations. Binding affinities (K D ) were calculated by fitting the data using the ITC data analysis module of Origin 7.0 (OriginLab). The SPR experiments to measure the K D value between the two proteins were carried out by using BIAcore3000 (GE Healthcare). The purified and auto-phosphorylated IR (pY972-IRK) was immobilized by amine-coupling onto a CM-5 chip (GE Healthcare) as a ligand, and all of the processes were followed using the general protocol for BIAcore 3000. The optimal condition for the IR immobilization was at pH 4.0. One blank was used as a negative control channel. The K D values were calculated by performing the kinetic experiments with varying analyte concentrations. The fitting of the sensorgrams for k a and k d were made by a nonlinear curve fitting on the subtracted curves using the Langmuir 1:1 binding model with the BIAevaluation program (version 3.2). In Vitro Pull-Down Experiments. The stabilized CHO IR (wild-type and full-length) and CHO Y972F IR cell-lines were maintained in an F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After the cells were depleted with FBS (16 h), they were treated with insulin (100 nM, 5 min), harvested, and lysed with RIPA buffer. The cell lysates were used for the following in vitro pull-down experiments, binding competition experiments, and dephosphorylation experiments. For the pull-down experiments, the anti-Flag (Stratagene) [or anti-His (Cell signaling)] antibody was incubated with the mixture of the Flag-tagged (or His-tagged) IRS-1 proteins and CHO IR cell lysates (4 h, 4 °C) before immunoprecipitation on a Protein G bead. After western blotting, the proteins on the PVDF membrane were detected with anti-IR, anti-Flag (or anti-His), and phospho-specific pY1162/1163 (Invitrogen) antibodies. The amount of input IRS-1 proteins was checked by the signal of either anti-Flag or anti-His antibody. The amount of the IR protein signal was quantified by using GeneTools (Syngene), and the data were evaluated by GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). IR:PTB-PIR Binding Competition. The Flag-tagged IRS-1 PTB-PIR protein was incubated with CHO IR cell lysates according to the method explained above with various concentrations of PTB-PIR, PTB, and PIR proteins (all removed of Flag-tag), and also the IR pY972 peptide (LYASSNPApYLSASDV). Different protein concentration ranges as shown in Fig. 2 were used due to different inhibitory effect in each case. The inhibitory effects of each protein were examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody and by further immunoblotting with anti-Flag and anti-IR antibodies. The signals were quantified using GeneTools. The amount of the Flag-tagged IRS-1 PTB-PIR was detected with the anti-Flag antibody. The IC 50 values were calculated by plotting of the bound IR (%) vs. Log (competitor concentration) using GraphPad Prism 5. PTP1B-Mediated IR Dephosphorylation Experiment. CHO IR cells were lysed as previously described and further purified by using WGA (Sigma-Aldrich) equilibrated with 30 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% NaN 3 and by subsequent elution with 0.3 M N-acetyl glucosamine (Sigma-Aldrich). Purified phosphorylated IR proteins were stored at −80 °C before using them for dephosphorylation experiments. Purified phosphorylated IR (approximately 1 μm) was incubated with 10 μm PTB or PTB- PIR in the dephosphorylation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM MES pH 7.2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% NP-40) for 10 min at room temperature. The dephosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding 1 µL of 5 ng/μL PTP1B (Calbiochem) to the mixture. At indicated time points (0, 5, 20, and 40 min), aliquots were removed from the reaction solution and the reactions were quenched by adding Laemmli loading buffer. For control experiments, only the PTB1B was added to the purified IR with or without the PTP1B inhibitor (EMD Millipore) (1.7 μg) and the total pY levels monitored at 0, 5, and 20 min. Dephosphorylations of IR at each time point were detected by using anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate and BD Science) and phospho-specific antibodies for pY1162/1163, pY972, and pY1334 (Invitrogen). Also during the pY1334 detection, the total IR input amount was assessed by immunoblotting using anti-IR antibody, and the total IRS-1 protein amount assessed by Coomassie blue staining. CHO IR/IRS-1 Cell-Based Insulin Activation Studies. Full-length IRS-1 WT and 4E mutants were cloned into pCMV-Tag2B vector which allowed expression of IRS-1 with an N-terminal FLAG. Over 80% confluent CHO IR cells were transfected with either IRS-1 WT or 4E mutant by using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Thermo Fisher). One day after the transfection, cells were incubated 24 h with serum-free media, and treated with 100 nM insulin (10 min). Cells were washed with cold PBS, harvested, and lysed in 30 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 5.0 mM glycerol phosphate, 100 mM NaF, 1.0 mM ammonium molybdate, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 5 mM EGTA augmented with a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (genDEPOT). Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to western blot analyses for the detections of IR (pY972, pY1162/1163, and pY) and AKT. For the detection of IRS-1, immunoprecipitation was done using the anti-FLAG antibody. The same antibodies for detection of proteins were used as above in addition to antibodies for AKT and phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling), and IRS-1 (Merck). GraphPad Prism 5 was used to carry out the Student t test. Hydrogen–Deuterium Exchange Reactions and MS Analysis (HDX-MS). First, 2 µL of pY972-IRK (described as above) (45 pmol/μL) in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl in H 2 O was prepared. The deuterium exchange in this sample was initiated by 15-fold dilution of the stock solution containing 20 mM Tris pD 7.5 and 100 mM NaCl in D 2 O at 22 °C. At each indicated deuterium exchange time point (10 s, 10 min, 1 h, and 3 h), the deuterium labeling was quenched by adjusting the pH to 2.6 with an equal volume of quench buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate pH 2.5, H 2 O). Immediately, the reaction mixture was incubated with pepsin at a 1:1 ( w / w ) ratio for 5 min at 0 °C. The resulting peptides were injected into a custom Waters nanoACQUITY UPLC system and analyzed. The injected peptides were trapped, desalted for 3 min with 100 µL/min flow, and then separated by an 8 to 92% acetonitrile:water gradient at 40 µL/min flow in 13 min. The separation column was a 1.0 × 100.0 mm ACQUITY UPLC BEH C8 (Waters) containing 1.7 μm particles. Mass spectra were processed with the software HX-Express, where the deuteration levels were calculated by subtracting the centroid of the isotopic distribution for peptide ions of undeuterated protein from the centroid of the isotopic distribution for peptide ions from the deuterium-labeled sample. The deuteration levels of some data were manually calculated using MagTran software ( 46 ). Supplementary Material Appendix 01 (PDF) We would like to thank Steven E.

  "plain_text": "Significance Insulin maintains glucose homeostasis, and the insulin-resistant condition is when the cells have impaired insulin response, which can further progress to type 2 diabetes. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR) to trigger phosphorylations on multiple IR and IRS-1 tyrosines for myriad of cellular responses. However, serine and threonine phosphorylations in insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) are well known in the insulin-resistant state. In this study, we demonstrate how a certain IRS-1 region encompassing four serines in its unphosphorylated state enhances insulin signaling by binding to the IRK, and by inhibiting the phosphatase mediating the IR dephosphorylation. We suggest that the serines in the phosphorylated state reverse these effects, which would in turn desensitize insulin signaling and confer insulin resistance.\n\nSerine phosphorylations on insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) by diverse kinases aoccur widely during obesity-, stress-, and inflammation-induced conditions in models of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we define a region within the human IRS-1, which is directly C-terminal to the PTB domain encompassing numerous serine phosphorylation sites including Ser307 (mouse Ser302) and Ser312 (mouse 307) creating a phosphorylation insulin resistance (PIR) domain. We demonstrate that the IRS-1 PTB-PIR with its unphosphorylated serine residues interacts with the insulin receptor (IR) but loses the IR-binding when they are phosphorylated. Surface plasmon resonance studies further confirm that the PTB-PIR binds stronger to IR than just the PTB domain, and that phosphorylations at Ser307, Ser312, Ser315, and Ser323 within the PIR domain result in abrogating the binding. Insulin-responsive cells containing the mutant IRS-1 with all these four serines changed into glutamates to mimic phosphorylations show decreased levels of phosphorylations in IR, IRS-1, and AKT compared to the wild-type IRS-1. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments indicating the PIR domain interacting with the N-terminal lobe and the hinge regions of the IR kinase domain further suggest the possibility that the IRS-1 PIR domain protects the IR from the PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation."
