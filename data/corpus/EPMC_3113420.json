    "abstract_text": "Human placental poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was purified and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of 16 KDa and 40 KDa chymotryptic peptides were determined. Screening of a lambda gt11 cDNA library of normal human placenta with a 51-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide yielded one clone with a 1.8 Kb insert and two clones with 2.1 Kb inserts. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the 1.8 Kb insert exactly matched the determined amino acid sequences. From a Northern blot analysis, a single 3.6 Kb mRNA was detected in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, the RNA expression of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase gene was shown to decrease during the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells upon induction by retinoic acid.",
