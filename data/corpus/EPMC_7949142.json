    "abstract_text": "The NFKB2(lyt-10) gene codes for a protein that is a member of the NK-kappa B/rel family of transcription factors containing a DNA-binding rel domain and a carboxy-terminal ankyrin-like domain. The NFKB2 gene represents a candidate proto-oncogene, since it has been found to be involved in a chromosomal translocation t(10;14)(q24;q32) in one case of B-cell lymphoma and in gene rearrangements in various types of lymphoid malignancies. To elucidate the structural and functional consequences of NFKB2 rearrangements, we report the molecular characterization of three novel rearranged NFKB2 genes in lymphoid tumors. In one case of multiple myeloma (MM), cloning and sequencing analysis of reciprocal breakpoint sites showed that they occurred within intron 15 of the NFKB2 gene and led to the complete deletion of the 3' portion of the gene coding for the ankyrin domain. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that the novel regions involved in the NFKB2 rearrangement originated from chromosome 7q34, thus implying the occurrence of a t(7;10)(q34;q24) reciprocal chromosomal translocation. In one case of T-cell cutaneous lymphoma (CTCL) and in one of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), NFKB2 rearrangements occurred, respectively, within exons 18 and 20 of the gene and involved recombinations with distinct regions of chromosome 10q24. Molecular analysis suggested that these rearrangements may occur as a consequence of small internal chromosomal deletions. In both of these cases, the rearrangements led to specific carboxy-terminal truncations of NFKB2 generating abnormal transcripts that coded for proteins lacking portions of the ankyrin domain. These proteins localize in the nucleus, suggesting their constitutive activation in vivo. Overall, our results indicate that NFKB2 rearrangements in lymphoid neoplasia may occur by heterogeneous mechanisms, including internal chromosomal deletion or chromosomal translocation. The common consequence of these rearrangements appears to be the deletion of 3' sequences of NFKB2 leading to the production of carboxy-truncated constitutively nuclear proteins that may be involved in tumorigenesis.",
