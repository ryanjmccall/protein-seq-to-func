  "abstract_text": "E2F transcription factors play an essential role in cell proliferation and apoptosis and their activity is frequently deregulated in human cancers. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified a novel E2F-binding protein. Due to its strong phosphorylation we named it EAPP (e2F-associated phosphoprotein). EAPP is localized in the nucleus and interacts with E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3, but not with E2F-4. Examination of a number of human cell lines revealed that EAPP levels are elevated in most transformed cells. Moreover, EAPP mRNA was detected in all investigated human tissues in varying amounts. EAPP is present throughout the cell cycle but disappears during mitosis. In transfection assays with reporters controlled by either an artificial E2F-dependent promoter or the murine thymidine kinase promoter, EAPP increased the activation caused by E2F-1 but not by E2F-4. Surprisingly, the promoter of the p14(ARF) gene, which was also activated by E2F-1, became repressed by EAPP. Overexpression of EAPP in U2OS cells resulted in a significant increase of cells in S-phase, whereas RNAi-mediated knock down of EAPP reduced the fraction of cells in S-phase. Taken together, these data suggest that EAPP modulates E2F-regulated transcription, stimulates proliferation, and may be involved in the malignant transformation of cells.",
