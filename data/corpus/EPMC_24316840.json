    "abstract_text": "The BRCA1 holoenzyme complex plays an important role in DNA damage repair. ABRAXAS is a newly discovered component of this complex and its C-terminal region directly binds to the BRCA1 BRCT domain. Single crystals of the BRCA1 BRCT-ABRAXAS complex grown by co-crystallization belonged to space group P4(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 187.18, c = 85.31 \u00c5. Diffraction data were collected on the BM-14 beamline at the ESRF. Molecular-replacement calculations using Phaser led to three molecules in the asymmetric unit and a high solvent content of 76%.",
