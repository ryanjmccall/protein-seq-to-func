O- GlcNAcylation is a dynamic post-translational modification that diversifies the proteome. Its dysregulation is associated with neurological disorders that impair cognitive function, and yet identification of phenotype-relevant candidate substrates in a brain-region specific manner remains unfeasible. By combining an O- GlcNAc binding activity derived from Clostridium perfringens OGA ( Cp OGA) with TurboID proximity labeling in Drosophila , we developed an O- GlcNAcylation profiling tool that translates O- GlcNAc modification into biotin conjugation for tissue-specific candidate substrates enrichment. We mapped the O- GlcNAc interactome in major brain regions of Drosophila and found that components of the translational machinery, particularly ribosomal subunits, were abundantly O- GlcNAcylated in the mushroom body of Drosophila brain. Hypo- O- GlcNAcylation induced by ectopic expression of active Cp OGA in the mushroom body decreased local translational activity, leading to olfactory learning deficits that could be rescued by dMyc overexpression-induced increase of protein synthesis. Our study provides a useful tool for future dissection of tissue-specific functions of O- GlcNAcylation in Drosophila , and suggests a possibility that O- GlcNAcylation impacts cognitive function via regulating regional translational activity in the brain. eLife digest Newly synthesized proteins often receive further chemical modifications that change their structure and role in the cell. O -GlcNAcylation, for instance, consists in a certain type of sugar molecule being added onto dedicated protein segments. It is required for the central nervous system to develop and work properly; in fact, several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington\u2019s disease are linked to disruptions in O -GlcNAcylation. However, scientists are currently lacking approaches that would allow them to reliably identify which proteins require O -GlcNAcylation in specific regions of the brain to ensure proper cognitive health. To address this gap, Yu et al. developed a profiling tool that allowed them to probe O -GlcNAcylation protein targets in different tissues of fruit flies. Their approach relies on genetically manipulating the animals so that a certain brain area overproduces two enzymes that work in tandem; the first binds specifically to O -GlcNAcylated proteins, which allows the second to add a small \u2018biotin\u2019 tag to them. Tagged proteins can then be captured and identified. Using this tool helped Yu et al. map out which proteins go through O -GlcNAcylation in various brain regions. This revealed, for example, that in the mushroom body \u2013 the \u2018learning center\u2019 of the fly brain \u2013 O -GlcNAcylation occurred predominantly in the protein-building machinery. To investigate the role of O -GlcNAcylation in protein synthesis and learning, Yu et al. used an approach that allowed them to decrease the levels of O -GlcNAcylation in the mushroom body. This resulted in reduced local protein production and the flies performing poorly in olfactory learning tasks. However, artificially increasing protein synthesis reversed these deficits. Overall, the work by Yu et al. provides a useful tool for studying the tissue-specific effects of O -GlcNAcylation in fruit flies, and its role in learning. Further studies should explore how this process may be linked to cognitive function by altering protein synthesis in the brain.

Author impact statement Brain region-specific profiling of O- GlcNAcylation interactome in Drosophila mushroom body suggests that hypo- O- GlcNAcylation impacts cognitive function by regulating translational activity. Introduction Protein O- GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification that occurs on thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, conveying various stimuli or stressors such as fluctuating nutrient levels to distinct cellular processes ( Yang and Qian, 2017 ; Olivier-Van Stichelen and Hanover, 2015 ; Davie et al., 2018 ). It involves reversible attachment of \u03b2- N -acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues of protein substrates, catalyzed by a pair of evolutionarily conserved enzymes, O- GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O- GlcNAcase (OGA) ( Vocadlo, 2012 ). As a monosaccharide modification, the addition and removal of O- GlcNAc moiety are dynamic, with cycling rates ranging from several minutes to the lifetime of a protein ( Miller et al., 1999 ; Roquemore et al., 1996 ). By modifying different protein substrates, O- GlcNAcylation exerts critical regulatory functions in a wide range of basic cellular processes, including transcription, translation, and protein homeostasis ( Yang and Qian, 2017 ; Uygar and Lagerl\u00f6f, 2023 ; Wang et al., 2023 ). O- GlcNAcylation is ubiquitously distributed but more abundant in some tissues, such as the brain ( Fehl and Hanover, 2022 ; Wulff-Fuentes et al., 2021 ). Given its enrichment in brain tissues and essential biological functions, it is not surprising that O- GlcNAc cycling is required for the development and functions of central nervous system ( Olivier-Van Stichelen and Hanover, 2015 ; Lagerl\u00f6f, 2018 ; Akan et al., 2018 ), and its dysregulation is linked to numerous neurological disorders ( Uygar and Lagerl\u00f6f, 2023 ; Lagerl\u00f6f, 2018 ; Lee et al., 2021 ; Banerjee et al., 2016 ). O- GlcNAc homeostasis appears to be required for proper cognitive function, although the molecular connections between the dysregulated O- GlcNAcome and cognitive impairment are not fully understood. Hypomorphic mutations of OGT are implicated in an X-linked intellectual disability syndrome ( Pravata et al., 2020a ; Pravata et al., 2019 ; Selvan et al., 2018 ; Willems et al., 2017 ; Vaidyanathan et al., 2017 ), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder now termed OGT -associated Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (OGT-CDG) ( Pravata et al., 2020b ). Drosophila models of OGT-CDG that carry the equivalent human disease-related OGT missense mutations manifest deficits in sleep and habituation, an evolutionarily conserved form of non-associative learning ( Fenckova et al., 2022 ). Our recent work has shown that decreased O- GlcNAcylation level in Drosophila , induced through overexpression of a bacterial OGA from Clostridium perfringens ( Cp OGA), leads to a deficit of associative olfactory learning. More interestingly, ectopic expression of Cp OGA during early embryogenesis results in reduced brain size and learning defects in adult flies, likely due to interference of the sog-Dpp signaling required for neuroectoderm specification ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). These studies reveal that disturbed O- GlcNAc homeostasis can impact cognitive function by compromising neuronal development. On the other hand, a number of studies have revealed that impaired O- GlcNAcylation is implicated in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD ) ( Uygar and Lagerl\u00f6f, 2023 ; Lagerl\u00f6f, 2018 ; Lee et al., 2021 ; Banerjee et al., 2016 ; Balana and Pratt, 2021 ; Quan et al., 2023 ). In the cerebrum of AD patients, O- GlcNAcylation levels are significantly lower than that of healthy controls ( Liu et al., 2009 ). Upregulation of O- GlcNAcylation levels by limiting OGA activity recovers the impaired cognitive function in AD mice models ( Park et al., 2021 ; Kim et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, during normal aging in mice, reduction of O- GlcNAcylation levels also occurs in the hippocampus, and elevation of neuronal O- GlcNAc modification ameliorates associative learning and memory ( Wheatley et al., 2019 ). These results indicate that, in addition to its involvement in neurodevelopment, O- GlcNAc homeostasis is also required for normal neuronal activity and cognitive function. However, the identity of key O- GlcNAc protein substrates supporting the cognitive abilities in adult brain and their spatial distribution remain largely unknown. An obstacle to comprehensively identifying the O- GlcNAc conveyors of various cognitive functions is the lack of an effective tissue-specific O- GlcNAc profiling method. Given the structural diversity and relatively low abundance, enrichment of O- GlcNAc-modified proteins is required for mass spectrometry (MS)-based profiling of O- GlcNAcylation ( Yin et al., 2021 ). The enrichment strategies roughly fall into two categories. One category involves direct capture of O- GlcNAcylated proteins by antibodies or lectins that recognize the GlcNAc moiety ( Yin et al., 2021 ; Hu et al., 2022 ; Dupas et al., 2022 ; Saha et al., 2021 ; Maynard and Chalkley, 2021 ; Ma et al., 2021a ; Ma et al., 2021b ). O- GlcNAc antibodies including RL2 and CTD110.6, as well as O- GlcNAc-binding lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), are commonly used for enrichment. In addition, the catalytic-dead mutant of Cp OGA that retains the ability to recognize O- GlcNAcylated substrates was successfully repurposed to concentrate many developmental regulators from Drosophila embryo lysates ( Selvan et al., 2017 ). Another category of enrichment strategies relies on chemoenzymatic or metabolic labeling ( Yin et al., 2021 ; Hu et al., 2022 ; Dupas et al., 2022 ; Saha et al., 2021 ; Maynard and Chalkley, 2021 ; Ma et al., 2021a ; Ma et al., 2021b ). Azido-modified intermediates, such as N -azidoacetylglucosamine (GlcNAz) and N -azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz), are used to introduce specific tags (e.g. biotin) to protein substrates via Staudinger ligation or click chemistry, allowing for capture and enrichment of O- GlcNAcylated proteins. A recent study coupled the O- GlcNAc-binding lectin GafD to the proximity labeling TurboID yielding the GlycoID tool ( Liu et al., 2022 ), in which GafD domain recognizes O- GlcNAcylated substrates and the TurboID enzyme attaches nonhydrolyzable biotin tags to proximal proteins within approximately 10 nm radius ( Branon et al., 2018 ). The GlycoID tool was used to profile O- GlcNAcylation in different subcellular spaces including the nucleus and cytosol ( Liu et al., 2022 ). It is noteworthy that the O -GlcNAcylated proteins identified by different O- GlcNAcylation profiling strategies are quite diverse, probably due to the dynamic nature of O -GlcNAc cycling as well as the potential bias in substrates preference intrinsic to the methods ( Zachara et al., 2004 ; Ma and Hart, 2014 ). Nonetheless, these advancements have greatly expanded the pan- O- GlcNAcome over the past 30 years ( Wulff-Fuentes et al., 2021 Ma et al., 2021a ). However, none of them has been adopted for tissue-specific identification of O- GlcNAcylated proteins. Here, we generated transgenic Drosophila lines that allow specific expression of Cp OGA in different brain regions. Ectopic expression of Cp OGA in the major learning center of Drosophila brain, the mushroom body, reduced local O- GlcNAcylation levels and impaired olfactory learning. We further combined a catalytically incompetent Cp OGA mutant ( Cp OGA CD ) with the proximity labeling enzyme TurboID to develop an O- GlcNAcylation profiling tool. By conditional expression of this tool to translate O- GlcNAc modification into biotin conjugation in specific brain structures, we mapped the O- GlcNAc interactome and generated an O- GlcNAc atlas for different brain regions of Drosophila (tsOGA, https://www.kyuanlab.com/tsOGA ). Particularly, we detected abundant O- GlcNAc modifications associated with protein components of the translational machinery in the mushroom body. Lowering the mushroom body O- GlcNAcylation levels reduced the synthesis of new proteins, interfering with olfactory learning, which could be reversed by increasing ribosomal biogenesis via overexpression of dMyc. We propose that compromised translational activity in the brain learning center contributes to the cognitive deficits of O- GlcNAcylation insufficiency-associated neurological diseases. Results Perturbation of the mushroom body O -GlcNAcylation leads to olfactory learning deficits We previously reported that ubiquitous expression of Cp OGA in Drosophila reduced global O- GlcNAcylation levels and resulted in impaired olfactory learning ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). To determine which brain region was responsible for this hypo- O- GlcNAcylation induced learning defect, we conditionally expressed wild-type Cp OGA ( Cp OGA WT ) in different brain structures of Drosophila ( Figure 1A ). Cp OGA DM , which carries two point-mutations (D298N and D401A) that inactivate both the catalytic and binding activities toward O- GlcNAc modification, was used as a control. We dissected brains from the adult flies and validated tissue-specific expression patterns via immunostaining. As expected, Elav-Gal4 induced Cp OGA WT expression in the whole brain ( Figure 1B ), leading to decreased O- GlcNAcylation levels compared to the Cp OGA DM ( Figure 1C ). Similarly, other tissue-specific Gal4 drivers activated Cp OGA expression in different brain structures and perturbed local O- GlcNAc modifications. For instance, OK107-Gal4 drove Cp OGA WT expression in the mushroom body and downregulated O- GlcNAcylation levels in the Kenyon cells ( Figure 1D and E ). Figure 1.

In one trial, about 100 flies were trained to associate one of the two aversive odors (MCH or OCT) with electric shock on the upper part of a T-maze, and tested for odor preference on the lower part of the T-maze. Each independent experiment consisted of two trials with different odors coupled to the electric shock. The mean PI was calculated and plotted as one datapoint. ( D ) Temperature shifting scheme for Gal80 ts restricted expression of Clostridium perfringens OGA ( Cp OGA) till adulthood. Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1. Excel spreadsheet containing source data used to generate Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B . We then evaluated the cognitive ability of these flies using an olfactory learning assay as previously reported ( Jia et al., 2021 ; Mariano et al., 2020 ; Busto et al., 2010 ). To rule out the possibility that overexpression of Cp OGA WT or Cp OGA DM differentially disrupted odor preference, we tested their olfactory acuity toward either 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH) or octanol (OCT) using air as a control. Tissue-specific expression of Cp OGA WT or Cp OGA DM in the antennal and optic lobes caused differences in odor susceptibility toward MCH or OCT, and these flies were, therefore, not included in subsequent olfactory learning tests ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B). Flies expressing Cp OGA WT or Cp OGA DM in brain neurons, mushroom body, or ellipsoid body were trained to associate electric shock punishment with an air current containing MCH or OCT, and then tested for the ability to remember the electric shock-associated odor using a T-maze apparatus ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ). Compared to Cp OGA DM , conditional expression of Cp OGA WT in brain neurons or mushroom body compromised the ability to establish the association between odor and electric shock ( Figure 1F ), suggesting that decreased O- GlcNAcylation levels in these brain regions resulted in a deficit in olfactory learning. In contrast, flies expressing Cp OGA WT or Cp OGA DM in the ellipsoid body, as well as the control flies without a Gal4 driver, showed no statistical difference in the learning performance ( Figure 1F ). Ectopic expression of Cp OGA WT in the mushroom body driven by OK107-Gal4 might impact neuronal development during the larval stages ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). To directly investigate whether perturbation of O- GlcNAcylation compromised neuronal function in adult flies, we used the temperature-sensitive Gal80 (Gal80 ts ) to restrict Cp OGA expression until adulthood ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ). This temporally controlled expression of Cp OGA WT specifically in the adult mushroom body did not affect the odor acuity but significantly disrupted olfactory learning relative to Cp OGA DM control ( Figure 1G , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B). These results suggested that proper O- GlcNAcylation homeostasis is essential for the mushroom body function. O -GlcNAcylation profiling through Cp OGA proximity labeling The mushroom body is known to be the associative learning center in Drosophila brain ( Heisenberg, 2003 ; McGuire et al., 2001 ). Having discovered that O- GlcNAcylation homeostasis in the mushroom body was critical for olfactory learning, we developed an O- GlcNAc profiling method that allows the identification of candidate O- GlcNAcylated protein substrates in this brain region. Mutation of the catalytic residue Asp298 to Asn (D298N) of Cp OGA ( Cp OGA CD ) inactivates the enzymatic activity but retains its ability to bind O- GlcNAcylated peptides. Taking advantage of this property, far western, gel electrophoresis, proximity ligation, and imaging methods have been developed ( Selvan et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ; Song et al., 2021 ; Mariappa et al., 2015 ; Estevez et al., 2020 ), and immobilized Cp OGA CD has been successfully used to enrich O- GlcNAcylated substrates in vitro ( Selvan et al., 2017 ). We linked this O- GlcNAc binding activity of Cp OGA CD with TurboID, a biotin ligase that catalyzes biotinylation of adjacent proteins ( Branon et al., 2018 ), to tag the O- GlcNAcylated proteins with biotin for subsequent enrichment and Mass Spectrometry (MS) identification ( Figure 2A and B ). Cp OGA DM was adopted as a control to eliminate O- GlcNAc-independent protein-protein interactions ( Figure 2B ). Once induced by different tissue-specific drivers, this tool could tag and enrich O- GlcNAc substrates and their interactors in a tissue-specific manner, as endogenous protein biotinylation level is low in most organisms including Drosophila .

( B ) Schematic representation of TurboID- Cp OGA CD based profiling strategy. In the presence of biotin, TurboID biotinylates the Cp OGA CD -bound O- GlcNAc proteins, which can be further purified by streptavidin pull-down for mass spectrometry (MS) identification.

Excel spreadsheet containing source data used to generate Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E . As proof of concept, we generated stable HEK293T cells expressing TurboID- Cp OGA CD or its reference construct TurboID- Cp OGA DM . To characterize labeling activity, treatment with 10 mM or 100 mM biotin from an aqueous stock was first applied on these cells for 60 min, and the cell lysates were subject to western blot with streptavidin-HRP ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ). 10 mM biotin treatment yielded robust biotinylation of proteins, and this concentration was selected for subsequent experiments on cultured cells. To determine optimal incubation time, the cells were treated with 10 mM biotin from 15 to 180 min. Significant time-dependent labeling activity of proteins was observed, and 120 min was selected because it generated strong biotinylation in cells expressing Cp OGA CD compared to the Cp OGA DM control ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ). We validated whether a fluctuation in O- GlcNAcylation could be translated into biotinylation alterations. To this end, the cells were first treated with OGA inhibitor Thiamet-G or OGT inhibitor OSMI-1 for 6 hr followed by biotin incubation. Thiamet-G increased global O- GlcNAcylation levels, and the overall biotinylation was consistently upregulated. Conversely, OSMI-1 treatment decreased both O- GlcNAcylation and biotinylation in the cell lysates, suggesting that TurboID- Cp OGA CD effectively translates O- GlcNAc modification into biotin conjugation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C and D). To test whether TurboID- Cp OGA CD could be used to enrich and identify O- GlcNAcylated substrates, we performed immunoprecipitation with streptavidin magnetic beads from equal amount of cell lysates expressing either TurboID- Cp OGA CD or TurboID- Cp OGA DM after biotin incubation ( Figure 2C ). TurboID- Cp OGA CD labeled more proteins with biotin in the input compared to TurboID- Cp OGA DM , and consistently, more biotinylated proteins were immunoprecipitated. Importantly, western blot with anti- O- GlcNAc antibody RL2 detected strong O- GlcNAcylation signals in immunoprecipitants from the cells expressing TurboID- Cp OGA CD but not TurboID- Cp OGA DM , indicating successful enrichment of O- GlcNAc substrates using the biotin tags ( Figure 2C ). We scaled up the experiments and carried out MS analysis on the immunoprecipitants. Proteins that were selectively enriched in the TurboID- Cp OGA CD group relative to the TurboID- Cp OGA DM control (log 2 FC >1) were regarded as O- GlcNAcylated substrates ( Figure 2B ). We, therefore, identified 336 O- GlcNAc candidate substrates from HEK293T cells ( Supplementary file 1 ). To compare this result with known O- GlcNAc modifications, we compiled two lists of the previously identified O- GlcNAcylated proteins in HEK293T cells via either direct capture ( Zhao et al., 2011 ; Teo et al., 2010 ) or chemoenzymatic labeling methods ( Wang et al., 2021 ; Zhu et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2016 ; Hahne et al., 2013 ; Supplementary file 2 ). Gene ontology (GO) analysis on these three datasets showed that they were enriched in similar biological processes ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E ). Overlap analysis revealed that 52% (178/336) of the O- GlcNAc candidate substrates identified in our study were also present in previous reports ( Figure 2D ). 48 proteins were shared among the three lists ( Supplementary file 3 ), encompassing many well-known O- GlcNAcylated proteins such as OGT ( Griffin et al., 2016 ), NUP153 ( Li et al., 2022 ), NUP62 ( Zhu et al., 2016 ), and HCFC1 ( Capotosti et al., 2011 ). Protein-protein interaction networks of these 48 proteins highlighted four cellular component clusters: the MLL1 complex, nuclear pores, COPII vesicle coats, and cytoplasmic stress granules ( Figure 2E ). Additionally, of the 158 candidate proteins that were unique in our result, 113 were annotated as O- GlcNAcylation substrates in the O- GlcNAc database ( https://www.oglcnac.mcw.edu/ ). These results validated that TurboID- Cp OGA CD was able to selectively tag O- GlcNAcylated proteins with biotin for enrichment and identification. Region-specific O- GlcNAcylation profiling of Drosophila brain We next generated transgenic flies harboring UAS-TurboID- Cp OGA CD or UAS-TurboID- Cp OGA DM via \u03c6C31 integrase-mediated site-specific recombination. To test biotinylation efficiency, we used Da-Gal4 to drive ubiquitous expression and raised the flies on biotin-containing food (100 mM) from early embryonic stage to adulthood according to previous reports ( Branon et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ; Figure 3A ). Flies were homogenized and equal amounts of lysate were used in immunoprecipitation experiments. Similar to the result with HEK293T cells, TurboID- Cp OGA CD catalyzed more biotinylation in the input relative to TurboID- Cp OGA DM , and more biotinylated proteins were immunoprecipitated, in which strong O- GlcNAcylation signals were detected ( Figure 3B ). To validate whether TurboID- Cp OGA CD could achieve brain region-specific labeling of O- GlcNAcome with a biotin tag, we selected different Gal4 to drive TurboID- Cp OGA CD in distinct brain regions and fed the flies with biotin. Whole-mount staining of the brains showed that TurboID- Cp OGA CD displayed specific expression patterns as expected. More importantly, staining with streptavidin-Cy3 detected strong biotinylation in the brain regions expressing TurboID- Cp OGA CD , whereas the rest of the brain showed negligible background signals ( Figure 3C ).

( E ) Strategy to normalize the O- GlcNAcylated protein level with expression level for each candidate substrate in different brain regions. A normalizing factor for each substrate in a given brain region was calculated using single-cell RNA-seq expression data, and the adjusted O- GlcNAc level was determined as the log 2 FC divided by its normalizing factor. ( F ) The front-page of the tsOGA (tissue-specific O- GlcNAcylation Atlas of Drosophila brain) website. Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1. Excel spreadsheet containing source data used to generate Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D . Subsequently, we immunoprecipitated biotinylated proteins from these fly brain lysates using streptavidin magnetic beads and performed MS analysis to identify putative O- GlcNAc substrates in different brain regions. Proteins with higher LFQ (label-free quantitation) intensity in the TurboID- Cp OGA CD group relative to the TurboID- Cp OGA DM control (log 2 FC >1 or p<0.05) were considered as potentially O- GlcNAcylated substrates. We, therefore, identified 491 putative O- GlcNAcylated proteins in all neurons in the fly brain (Elav-Gal4), 455 in the mushroom body (OK107-Gal4), 377 in the antennal lobe (GMR14H04-Gal4), 234 in the optic lobe (GMR33H10-Gal4), and 289 in the ellipsoid body (c232-Gal4) ( Figure 3D , Supplementary files 4-8 ). To obtain a functional overview of the O- GlcNAc interactome in different brain regions, GO analysis was performed to highlight the most enriched functional modules ( Figure 3E , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D ). The O- GlcNAc interactome in brain neurons was enriched in chemical synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter secretion, as well as chromatin remodeling, whereas putative O- GlcNAcylated substrates in specific brain regions were involved in rather diverse biological processes, ranging from mRNA splicing to chitin-base cuticle development. Of particular interest, putative O- GlcNAcylation modifications in the mushroom body were highly clustered in processes linked to translation, including cytoplasmic translation, translational initiation, ribosome assembly, and ribosome biogenesis. To eliminate possible interference caused by varying abundance of these candidate proteins in different brain regions, we normalized the calculated O- GlcNAc level (log 2 FC) of each substrate using its corresponding brain region-specific normalizing factor generated from the single-cell transcriptome atlas of the adult Drosophila brain ( Davie et al., 2018 ; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E ). For ease of search and use, we created an online database for t issue- s pecific O- G lcNAcylation A tlas of Drosophila Brain (tsOGA, http://kyuanlab.com/tsOGA/ ) to host these datasets ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F ). O- GlcNAcylation affects cognitive function of Drosophila by regulating translational activity in the mushroom body We calculated the percentage of ribosomal components in all the proteins identified from different brain regions, and found that nearly 10% of the putative O- GlcNAc substrates in the mushroom body were from ribosomes, much higher than that in other brain regions ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ). To validate that the observed enrichment was not due to higher expression levels of these ribosomal subunits in the mushroom body, we plotted the normalized O- GlcNAc levels of the putative ribosomal substrates alongside their mRNA abundances in different brain regions. While the O- GlcNAc levels were highest in the mushroom body, their mRNA abundances were not ( Figure 4A ). Moreover, in the mushroom body, the O- GlcNAc levels of these ribosomal proteins showed no correlation with their mRNA abundances ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ). Figure 4. O- GlcNAcylation is required for proper protein synthesis activity and olfactory learning.

Error bars represent SD. Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1. Excel spreadsheet containing source data used to generate Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F . To directly verify whether mushroom body ribosomes were hyper- O- GlcNAcylated, Flag-tagged RPL13A, a core component of the large ribosomal subunit, was expressed in brain neurons or specifically in the mushroom body, driven by Elav-Gal4, or OK107-Gal4, respectively. Intact ribosomes were then isolated from these brain regions by anti-Flag immunoprecipitation ( Huang et al., 2019 ; Figure 4B ). Silver staining detected an array of specific bands on SDS-PAGE gel in the immunoprecipitants, indicating successful enrichment of ribosomal components. Western blot with anti- O- GlcNAc antibody RL2 showed that ribosomes purified from mushroom body contained more O- GlcNAc modifications than that from whole brain neurons. These results ascertained that ribosomal components were abundantly O- GlcNAc modified in the learning center of Drosophila brain. To investigate whether high O- GlcNAcylation is required for translational activity in mushroom body, we dissected the brains of flies expressing Cp OGA WT driven by OK107-Gal4 and measured translation ex vivo using an O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP)-based protein synthesis assay ( Liu et al., 2012 ; Figure 4D ). Ectopic expression of Cp OGA WT but not the control Cp OGA DM in the mushroom body decreased local protein synthesis as visualized by the OPP fluorescent intensity ( Figure 4D and E ), suggesting that tuning down the O- GlcNAcylation compromised local translational activity. Hypo- O- GlcNAcylation in the mushroom body resulted in an olfactory learning defect ( Figure 1D and F ). We next investigated whether this cognitive phenotype was due to compromised translational activity. To this end, we selected a panel of representative ribosomal components that were significantly O- GlcNAcylated in the mushroom body, and performed RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown. The RNAi induced by Da-Gal4 reduced the expression of the targeted ribosomal genes to varying degrees ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C ). We then crossed the RNAi lines to OK107-Gal4 to drive specific knockdowns in the mushroom body, and conducted an olfactory learning assay with these flies. Downregulation of RPL11 and RPL24 in the ribosomal large subunit, and RPS3 and RPS6 in the ribosomal small subunit did not alter olfactory acuity but led to compromised olfactory learning ability ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F ), suggesting that reduction of translational activity was sufficient to cause learning impairment. We then reasoned that upregulation of translation might ameliorate the cognitive defect caused by Cp OGA WT -induced hypo- O- GlcNAcylation. Myc serves as a direct regulator of ribosome biogenesis, promoting protein synthesis through transcriptional control of RNA and protein components of ribosomes, as well as factors involved in the processing and nuclear export of these ribosomal subunits ( Gallant, 2013 ; Jiao et al., 2023 ; van Riggelen et al., 2010 ). We overexpressed dMyc in the mushroom body to boost local translational activity. The results revealed that dMyc expression restored local protein synthesis, and more importantly, rescued the hypo- O- GlcNAcylation-induced olfactory learning defect ( Figure 4C\u2013E ), indicating that O- GlcNAcylation insufficiency-induced cognitive impairment involves compromised translational activity in the brain learning center. Discussion Protein O- GlcNAcylation is controlled by a very simple system consisting of only two enzymes, OGT and OGA. Yet it can dynamically modify more than 5000 protein substrates in different tissues to regulate their stability, protein-protein interactions, enzymatic activity, as well as subcellular localization upon changes in cellular metabolisms. Deciphering the spatial-temporal profiles of protein O- GlcNAcome and linking subsets of O- GlcNAc substrates to different physiological and pathological phenotypes are major obstacles in the field. In this study, we developed an O- GlcNAcylation profiling tool that allowed tissue-specific identification of O- GlcNAc candidate substrates. With this tool, we depicted the O- GlcNAc interactome in different brain regions of Drosophila and established an online database tsOGA ( http://kyuanlab.com/tsOGA/ ) to facilitate future functional dissection of O- GlcNAcylation. Moreover, we consolidated a causal relationship between hypo- O- GlcNAcylation and cognitive impairment in Drosophila , and revealed that insufficient O- GlcNAcylation in the mushroom body of Drosophila brain reduced local translational activity that contributed to the observed olfactory learning deficits. The O- GlcNAcome in different tissues and cell populations is heterogeneous and pleiotropic, and our understanding of the tissue-specific functions of O- GlcNAc modification remains quite limited, mainly relying on conditional knockout studies of OGT or OGA ( Issad et al., 2022 ). Establishment of O -GlcNAcylation landscapes in different tissues under healthy and diseased conditions is needed to fully appreciate its multifaceted functions. The strategy reported here has achieved mapping the O- GlcNAcylated candidates with high spatial precision in Drosophila brain. With small modifications, this strategy can be readily applied to other tissues or even other model organisms in future studies. However, there are two potential caveats that need to be taken into consideration. First, the method relies on the ectopic expression of bacterial Cp OGA mutants fused with TurboID to label the O -GlcNAcome. The introduction of these foreign proteins could interfere with the normal functions of the targeted tissue. Although Drosophila seemed to tolerate this bacterial protein well when we assessed the functional consequences of expressing Cp OGA or its mutants in different tissues, their impacts on other model organisms remain unknown. Second, given that our method is based on the differential enrichment in the TurboID- Cp OGA CD experimental group relative to the TurboID- Cp OGA DM control group to identify putative O -GlcNAc substrates, the sensitivity is limited compared to the chemoenzymatic labeling methods. Additionally, because the TurboID biotinylates all proximal proteins within ~10 nm radius, the identified proteins can be in complex with other O -GlcNAc substrates but itself is not directly O -GlcNAcylated. Further biochemical validations are needed to ascertain the bona fide substrates and their modification sites. Nonetheless, using the O- GlcNAc profiling data generated with this method, we established a framework of a tissue-specific O- GlcNAcylation database for Drosophila . As more tissue-specific O- GlcNAc profiling data are generated and deposited, it will undoubtedly be a useful resource for the community to facilitate future functional interrogations of different O- GlcNAcylation substrates at the organismal level. The brain manifests high OGT expression and relies on protein O- GlcNAcylation to regulate many of its functions. Perturbed O- GlcNAcylation has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and several key etiological factors are known O- GlcNAc substrates, such as tau ( Liu et al., 2009 ; Yuzwa et al., 2012 ), \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) ( Park et al., 2021 ), neurofilaments (NFs) ( L\u00fcdemann et al., 2005 ), TDP-43 ( Zhao et al., 2021 ), and \u03b1-synuclein ( Levine et al., 2019 ; Marotta et al., 2015 ). Particularly, O- GlcNAcylation can antagonize hyperphosphorylation of tau and stabilize it from aggregation, preventing neuronal death and tauopathies ( Lee et al., 2021 ). Hence, OGA inhibitors have been tested in several clinical trials to target tauopathy and early symptomatic AD, leading to a recent FDA approval of the OGA inhibitor MK-8719 as an orphan drug for tau-driven neurodegenerative disease ( Wang et al., 2020 ). Our study strengthened a causal relationship between hypo- O- GlcNAcylation and cognitive impairment, and suggested that O -GlcNAcylation influences associative learning by regulating translational activity in the brain computational center. Consistent with previous reports ( Ohn et al., 2008 ; Shu et al., 2022 ; Zeidan et al., 2010 ), we identified components in the translational machinery as putative O -GlcNAc substrates, including several translational initiation factors and particularly many ribosomal subunits. The potential regulation of ribosomal activity by O- GlcNAcylation warrants future structural and biochemical characterizations. Our O- GlcNAc profiling results also provide a rich resource for the discovery of other conveyors of O- GlcNAc-associated cognitive deficits. For instance, the brain O- GlcNAc substrates, scu and Upf3 possess human homologs, HSD17B10, and UPF3B , that are known X-linked intellectual disability risk genes ( Firth et al., 2009 ; Vissers et al., 2016 ). In addition, recent studies have revealed that stress granules are tightly linked with autism spectrum disorders ( Jia et al., 2022 ). The enrichment of stress granule components in the O- GlcNAc substrate list suggests that O- GlcNAcylation dysregulation might be involved in autism as well. We anticipate that this study will galvanize further studies into targeting O- GlcNAcylation insufficiency to ameliorate cognitive defects commonly seen in many neurological diseases. Materials and methods Cell cultures and generation of stable cell lines HEK293T cells (Meisen CTCC) were cultured in a DMEM/high glucose medium (Biological Industries, 01-052-1A) with 10% FBS (VISTECH, SE100-B) at 37\u2103 under 5% CO 2 . The Cp OGA CD and Cp OGA DM sequences were codon optimized to Homo sapiens and Drosophila using Jcat ( Grote et al., 2005 ). The fragments of TurboID-CpOGA CD and TurboID-CpOGA DM ( TurboID-CpOGA CD/DM ) were PCR amplified and cloned into pCDH-CMV-HA vectors, respectively. For lentivirus preparation, HEK293T cells were transfected with TurboID-CpOGA CD/DM plasmid with the packaging plasmids pPAX2 and pMD.2G using Polyethylenimine Linear (PEI, Polysciences, 24765). The PEI-containing medium was replaced with fresh serum-containing DMEM medium after 8 hr, and the viral supernatants were collected 48 hr and 72 hr post-transfection. The viral supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 1 hr at 4\u2103, and the pellet was dissolved in PBS (Biological Industries, 02-023-1A). HEK293T cells were infected in six-well plates and selected with 1 \u00b5g/mL Puromycin (Selleck, s7417) in the medium for at least 5 days. For biotin labeling, the TurboID- Cp OGA CD or TurboID- Cp OGA DM expressing HEK293T cells were labeled with 10\u2013100 \u00b5M biotin (Merck, B4501) in the medium for 15 min to 3 hr. Labeling was stopped by placing cells on ice and washing cells three times with PBS (Biological Industries, 02-023-1A). Drosophila stocks and genetics All flies were raised on standard fly food at 25 \u00b0C. Biotin food was prepared by adding 200 mM biotin (Merck, B4501) to hot (~60\u2103) standard fly food and dissolved to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM ( Zhang et al., 2021 ). The strains used in this study were as follows: w1118 ,; sco/cyo;TM3/TM6B , Da-Gal4 (Gift from Kun Xia\u2019s lab), Elav-Gal4 (Gift from Zhuohua Zhang\u2019s lab), OK107-Gal4 , 201Y-Gal4 (Gift from Ranhui Duan\u2019s lab), C232-Gal4 (BDSC, #30828), GMR14H04-Gal4 (BDSC, #48655), GMR33H10-Gal4 (BDSC, #49762), Tub-Gal80 ts , uas-RPL13A-FLAG , uas-dMyc (Gift from Jun Ma\u2019s lab), uas-shLuciferase (Gift from Zhuohua Zhang\u2019s lab), uas-shRPL5 (THU0670), uas-shRPs26 (THU0747), uas-shRPL24 (THU1411), uas-shRPS6 (THU0864), uas-shRPL11 (TH201500769.S), uas-shRPS3 (THU1958), uas-shRPL32 (TH201500773.S), uas-shRPS28b (THU1037). Our study established two transgenic fly lines ( UAS-HA-TurboID-CpOGA CD and UAS-HA-TurboID-CpOGA DM ). TurboID-CpOGA CD/DM fragments were cloned into pUASz-HS-HA vectors, respectively using Gibson assembly (NEB). Constructs with the attB sequence were injected into flies ( y1, w67c23; P(CaryP) attP2 ) to initiate the \u03c6C31 integrase-mediated site-specific integration (UniHuaii). The resulted adult flies (G0) were crossed to double balancer to get the F1 generations. Olfactory learning and memory Behavioral experiments were carried out in an environmental chamber at 25 \u00b0C and 70% humidity as previously described ( Jia et al., 2021 ). We tested the acuity of flies against two aversive odors, 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH, Sigma, 104191) and 3-octanol (OCT, Sigma, 218405). Approximately 100 flies were placed in the center compartment of the T-maze, where the collection tubes were snapped into place at the choice point and the air and aversive odor tubes were connected with the distal ends of the collection tubes. Flies were allowed to choose between air versus aversive odor for 2 min. After the choice period, the sliding center compartment was pulled up quickly, trapping the flies in the collection tubes they had chosen. Flies in each collection tube were anesthetized and counted. Performance index (PI odor ) was determined as the number of flies on the air side (n(Air)) minus the number on the aversive odor side (n(odor)) divided by the total number of flies (n(Air)+n(odor)) and multiplied by 100%. PI odor =[n(Air)-n(odor)]/[n(Air)+n(odor)]\u00d7100%. If the experimental group flies have similar odor avoidance to that of control, they will be used for subsequent olfactory learning tests. After confirming that the flies to be tested have avoidance behavior in response to electric shock, flies were trained to associate an aversive odor (MCH or OCT) used as a conditioned stimulus (CS) with electric shock. The experiment comprised two phases: the flies were trained in the first phase, and the trained flies were tested in the second phase. During training, approximately 100 flies were simultaneously exposed to odor 1 (CS + ) and electric shock (60 V) in a training tube for 1 min. Then, they were exposed to the blank odor (air) for 1 min before receiving odor 2 (CS - ) without electric shock for 1 min, followed by the blank odor (air) for 1 min. Immediately after training, flies were transferred to the central chamber of the T-maze and retained there for 1 min. To measure learning, The center chamber was slid smoothly into the register with the choice point of the T-maze and the MCH and OCT odor tubes were supplied from the two distal ends of the collection tube to let the flies choose between the two odors for 2 min. The central chamber then was pulled up quickly, trapping the flies in the collection tube they had chosen. Flies in each collection tube were anesthetized and counted. We calculated the Performance Index (PI) for each condition as the number of flies avoiding the shock-paired odor (CS - ) minus the number of flies choosing the shock-paired odor (CS + ) divided by the total number of flies (CS - + CS + ) and multiplied by 100%. PI = [n(CS - )-n(CS + )]/[n(CS + )+n(CS - )]\u00d7100%. In each experiment, we calculated the mean PI from two trials: one in which MCH was the shock-paired odor, and the other in which OCT was the shock-paired odor. This method removed any potential bias caused by the flies having a stronger preference for one odor over the other. Therefore, each point in the bar graph consisted of approximately 200 flies (male: female = 1:1), with half of the flies trained to one odor, and the other half trained to the other odor. For the temporally controlled Cp OGA expression in the adult mushroom body, the flies were initially maintained at 19\u2103 until adulthood. Then, the flies were transferred to 29\u2103 for 3\u20135 days to inactivate Gal80 ts and hence allow the expression of Cp OGA. The behavioral experiments were carried out subsequently. Western blot assay The HEK293T cells and flies were lysed in lysis buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100, Sigma, P8340), and PMSF (1:100, Sigma, P7626) and 50 \u00b5M Thiamet-G (Selleck, s7213). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u2103, and the protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Beyotime, p0009). Proteins were mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (2% \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min at 95\u2103. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (90 V, 30 min; 120 V, 1 hr) and transferred to a Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF, Millipore, IPVH00010) membrane (290 mA, 90 min). The PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 hr, then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2103, and then incubated with secondary antibodies (1:5000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hr at room temperature. The signal was detected using ECL substrates (Millipore). Primary antibodies were dissolved in 5% BSA (Biofroxx, 4240GR005) and the dilutions were: Streptavidin-HRP (1:2000, GenScript, M00091), RL2 (1:1000, Abcam, ab2739), HA (1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, 3724), Tubulin (1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, 12351 S), FLAG (1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, 14793). For the Western blot experiment in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C and D, cells were cultured in the medium supplemented with 25 \u03bcM Thiamet-G (Selleck, s7213) or 25 \u03bcM OSMI-1(Sigma, SML1621) for 6 hr before lysis. For the experiment in Figure 4D , the gel was stained with a Fast Silver Stain Kit (Beyotime, P0017S). Immunoprecipitation For the immunoprecipitation experiment in Figures 2C and 3B , the HEK293T cells (1\u00d710 7 cells per sample) and flies (~20 flies per sample) were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM Na 2 VO 4 , 50 \u00b5M Thiamet-G) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100, Sigma, P8340) and PMSF (1:100, Sigma, P7626) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 g for 30 min at 4\u2103, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Beyotime, p0009). Streptavidin magnetic beads (MCE, HY-K0208) were washed twice with RIPA lysis buffer, and incubated with the same amount of lysate from TurboID- Cp OGA CD or control samples on a rotator overnight at 4\u2103. The beads were washed twice with 1 mL of RIPA lysis buffer, once with 1 mL of 1 M KCl, once with 1 mL of 0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 , once with 1 mL of 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and twice with 1 mL RIPA lysis buffer. After that, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min at 95\u2103. Finally, samples were stored at \u221280\u2103 for future analysis. The immunoprecipitation experiment in Figure 4B was performed as previously described ( Huang et al., 2019 ). Briefly, fly brains (~40 fly brains per sample) were lysed in ribo-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 12 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1% NP-40, 100 \u00b5g/mL cycloheximide, 50 \u00b5M Thiamet-G) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100, Sigma, P8340) and PMSF (1:100, Sigma, P7626) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 g for 30 min at 4\u2103, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Beyotime, p0009). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels (Sigma, A2220) were washed twice with ribo-lysis buffer, and incubated with tissue lysates on a rotator overnight at 4\u2103. The beads were washed three times with 1 mL of high salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 12 mM MgCl 2 , 300 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1% NP-40, 100 \u00b5g/mL cycloheximide). The beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min at 95\u2103. Finally, samples were stored at \u221280\u2103 for future analysis. Immunofluorescence The adult fly brains were dissected in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Biosharp, BL539A) for 1 hr at room temperature. The brains were washed three times with PBS (Biological Industries, 02-023-1A) and then permeabilized and blocked in 5% BSA (Biofroxx, 4240GR005) in 0.3% PBST (PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100) for 90 min at room temperature. After being washed three times with PBS, the brains were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2103, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DAPI (1:500, Sigma, D9542) for 1 hr at room temperature. The brains were then washed three times with PBS and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM880) with a 20x objective. Z-stacks were acquired with a spacing of 1 \u03bcm. Primary antibodies were dissolved in 5% BSA (Biofroxx, 4240GR005) and the dilutions were: Streptavidin-Cy3 (1:200, BioLegend, 405215), RL2 (1:200, Abcam, ab2739), HA (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 3724), and GFP (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 2955). Measurement of protein synthesis The protein synthesis in fly brains was assessed using the Click-iT Plus OPP Alexa Fluor 594 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10457). Fly brains were dissected in Drosophila medium (Gibco, 21720024) and then incubated in a medium containing 1:1000 (20 \u00b5M) of Click-iT OPP reagent at room temperature for 30 min. The brains were washed three times with PBS, and then fixed with 4% PFA (Biosharp, BL539A) for 1 hr at room temperature. The brains were permeabilized and blocked in 5% BSA (Biofroxx, 4240GR005) in 0.3% PBST (PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100) for 90 min at room temperature, and then washed three times with PBS. The brains were incubated with primary antibodies (GFP, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 2955) overnight at 4\u2103, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DAPI (1:500, Sigma, D9542) for 1 hr at room temperature. For the Click-iT reaction, brains were incubated in the Click-iT reaction cocktail in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Brains were then washed three times with PBS and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy (ZEISS LSM880). RT-qPCR RNA was extracted from flies using TRIzol (Life Technologies, 87804), and 1 \u03bcg total RNA was reverse transcribed to generate cDNA using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K1621). The cDNA was then used as templates and qPCR was performed using the SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Solomon Biotech, QST-100) on the QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The expression levels for each gene were normalized to Actin. Detailed information about the primers was listed in Supplementary file 9 . Protein identification by LC-MS/MS The HEK293T cells (2\u00d710 7 cells per sample) and fly brains (~200 fly brains that expressed TurboID- Cp OGA CD/DM in brain neurons per sample, ~800 fly brains that expressed TurboID- Cp OGA CD/DM in other brain structures per sample, three biological replicates) were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin magnetic beads as described above. The supernatants were used for SDS-PAGE separation and minimally stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (Solarbio, C8430-10g). The gels were cut into small pieces, and reduced and alkylated in 10 mM DTT and 55 mM IAA (Merck, I6125), respectively. For digestion, 0.5 \u00b5g sequencing-grade modified trypsin was added and incubated at 37\u2103 overnight. The peptides were then collected, desalted by StageTip (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 87782), and resolved in 0.1% formic acid before analysis by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with Easy-nLC 1200 system. Mobile phases A and B were water and 80% acetonitrile, respectively, with 0.1% formic acid. Protein digests were loaded directly onto an analytical column (75 \u00b5m\u00d715 cm, 1.9 \u00b5m C18, 1 \u00b5m tip) at a flow rate of 450 nL/min. Data were collected in a data-dependent manner using a top 25 method with a full MS mass range from 400 to 1400 m/z, 60,000 resolutions, and an AGC target of 3\u00d710 6 . MS2 scans were triggered when an ion intensity threshold of 4\u00d710 5 was reached. A dynamic exclusion time of 30 s was used. Ions with charge state 6\u20138 and more than eight were excluded. Data analysis The raw data were imported into the MaxQuant software to identify and quantify the proteins. The following parameters were used: trypsin for enzyme digestion; oxidation of methionine, acetylation of the protein N terminus, biotinylation of lysine and protein N terminus and HexNAc (ST) as variable modifications; carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification. We used the canonical human protein database (containing 20,379 reviewed protein isoforms) or Drosophila melanogaster protein database (containing 22,088 protein isoforms, including reviewed and unreviewed sequences) for database searching separately. The false discovery rate (FDR) was 1% for peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) and protein levels. For the proteomics data of different brain regions of Drosophila , we used label-free quantitation (LFQ) to determine the relative amounts of proteins among three replicates. Perseus software was used to filter out all contaminates identified by MaxQuant (contaminant proteins, reversed proteins, proteins only identified by site). A pseudocount of 1 was added to protein intensities in order to avoid taking the log of 0. We generated log 2 Fold Change (log 2 FC) values for each protein in the TurboID- Cp OGA CD group relative to the TurboID- Cp OGA DM control. For the proteomics data of HEK293T cell, only proteins identified with at least 2 peptides were considered for further analysis. Proteins were considered as O- GlcNAcylated substrates when differences in log 2 FC of TurboID- Cp OGA CD group with relative to the TurboID- Cp OGA DM control were higher than 1. For the proteomics data from different brain regions of Drosophila , only proteins identified with at least 2 peptides and in at least 2 of the 3 replicates of TurboID- Cp OGA CD were included for further analysis. A two-tailed unpaired student\u2019s t-test was applied in order to determine the statistical significance of the differences. Proteins were considered as O- GlcNAcylated substrates when differences in log 2 FC of TurboID- Cp OGA CD group with relative to the TurboID- Cp OGA DM control were higher than 1 or statistically significant (p<0.05). To adjust the interference caused by varying abundance of the putative O- GlcNAc substrates in different brain regions, single-cell transcriptomic data of the entire adult Drosophila brain (GEO: GSE107451) ( Davie et al., 2018 ) was used to generate a normalizing factor for each substrate. Briefly, the annotated cell clusters were categorized into different brain regions. Then, the average mRNA expression level of each gene within a certain brain region was calculated. The normalizing factor was defined as the ratio of the average mRNA expression level of a given gene in neurons from a specific brain region to the average mRNA expression level of the same gene in neurons from the whole brain ( Supplementary file 10 ). The normalized O- GlcNAc level was generated as the O- GlcNAc level (log 2 FC) of a putative O- GlcNAcylated protein divided by its normalizing factor in a certain brain region ( Supplementary file 11 ). Website The website was created to browse through the O- GlcNAc database ( https://www.kyuanlab.com/tsOGA ), using the database managem the ent system Centos and the uWSGI web framework. Backend servers were developed by Python programming language (version 3.7). GNU/Linux Debian-based systems with Gunicorn (Python HTTP) and NginX were used for the development and production of the website. The website search function was based on MySQL database. Quantification and statistical analysis To quantify fluorescent intensities in different Drosophila brain regions, whole brain images were stitched together using the stitching algorithm in ZEN software (Zeiss), and maximum intensity projection was produced. The images were then analyzed using ImageJ software. Mean fluorescent intensity of the whole brain or ROI was measured, and the relative fluorescent intensity was calculated as a ratio of the mean fluorescent intensity in ROI to that of the whole brain. GO enrichment analyses of O- GlcNAcome in HEK293T cells and Drosophila were performed using DAVID . Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of O- GlcNAcome in HEK293T cells was performed using STRING . GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analysis and the student\u2019s t-test was used to determine statistical significance. Bubble plots, pie plots and bar graphs were created using Hiplot , venn plots were created using jvenn .

Using a novel and powerful method of identifying proteins bearing this modification, the authors provide evidence that in a region of the Drosophila brain critical for associative learning, the mushroom body, there is a high representation of modified proteins affecting protein translation. Reductions in GlcNAc modification affects both an associative learning task and new protein synthesis, suggesting a critical function of these monosaccharide modifications in the regulation of protein synthesis required for memory formation. These findings provide a putative mechanism for human neurological deficits that accompany reductions in this ubiquitous carbohydrate modification. 10.7554/eLife.91269.sa1 Decision letter Ramaswami Mani Reviewing Editor https://ror.org/02tyrky19 Trinity College Dublin Ireland Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) public reviews designed to be posted alongside the preprint for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Olfactory learning in Drosophila requires O- GlcNAcylation of mushroom body ribosomal subunits\" for consideration by eLife . Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions (for the authors): 1) Potential reasons for the very low overlap with other methods to identify GlycNac-modified proteins requires more discussion o, as well as potential problems with the authors own approach 2) The current data do not rule out the possibility that altering GLcNAC affects LTM through a mechanism independent of ribosome modification and/or activity dependent translational control. It should be clearly acknowledged in the abstract and discussion that the data fall short of causally connecting ribosomal protein modification with translational control required for LTM. Phrases like \"consistent with\" may be useful. 3) Please respond carefully and as you consider appropriate all of the other comments of the reviewers. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): 1. This study relies almost exclusively on the over-expression of foreign proteins and interpreting their effects based solely on their known affinity and activity for O-GlcNac modifications. The effects of high levels of over-expression are often hard to identify or know and while there are appropriate controls in their studies, using catalytically inactive mutant forms for comparison, there is no discussion of this issue. The authors do describe that over-expression in optic and antennal lobes for example, provided reason for exclusion by virtue of differences in susceptibility (that term is not explained), indicating there are behavioral effects that can interfere with their assays. Some direct discussion of this potential problem is warranted. 2. Their comparison of several methods of identifying O-GlcNAc-modified proteins was tested in HEK293 cells, providing a measure of their method of proximity-labelling using their Clostridium OGA construct. The set of proteins identified by all three tested methods revealed 48, a modest number compared to the total sets for each method (2119, 273 and 336) for chemoenzymatic, direct capture and TurboID-CpOGA. This level of concordance suggests that different methods might well identify different sets of proteins, a concern for interpreting the functional significance of these changes. Do the authors argue that these results only affect sensitivity or could it possibly bias the classes of O-GlcNAc modified proteins identified? 3. The rescue of associative learning phenotypes mediated by reductions in O-GlcNAc modification by over-expression of dMyc is a very important experiment that supports their conclusion that translational deficits are the basis of the learning defects. The authors should explain further in the text the rationale and basis for this experiment, namely, how dMyc affects the protein synthetic machinery and why these changes could rescue loss of O-GlcNAc modifications. 4. The paper is challenging to read, and I suggest the authors provide it for reading and editing by someone not in their immediate field in order to make changes that make it more accessible to a general reader. 5. Their graphics are terrific and provide great assistance in clarifying the figures. Well done. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): As it stands the manuscript does not support the idea that O-GlcNAcylation of ribosomal proteins in the mushroom body (MB) is required for protein synthesis and olfactory learning. Experiments targeting specific ribosomal components could be a compelling demonstration. For example, Ser/Thr residues that get O-GlcNAcylated in RPL24 or RPS3 could be mutated. If these mutants showed learning defects it would be an important result. Same type of mutants in ex vivo OPP assays could be performed to determine their effect on protein synthesis. These types of experiments would definitely show specific requirement of ribosomal protein modification for ribosomal activity and associative learning. 10.7554/eLife.91269.sa2 Author response Essential revisions (for the authors): 1) Potential reasons for the very low overlap with other methods to identify GlycNac-modified proteins requires more discussion o, as well as potential problems with the authors own approach Thank you for raising this important issue. A lot of effort has been made to identify protein O- GlcNAc modifications and many profiling methods have been established in the past 30 years 1 . However, as you pointed out, the O -GlcNAcome identified using different methods are quite diverse. There are at least two possible reasons behind the observed low overlap. First, O -GlcNAcylation is highly responsive to a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, acting as an important cellular metabolic and stress sensing mechanism 2 . Meanwhile, as a monosaccharide modification, the addition and removal of O- GlcNAc moiety can be very rapid, with cycling rates as short as several minutes 3,4 . This dynamic nature of O -GlcNAc cycling contributes to the observed diversity among different profiling attempts. Second, the high lability of the GlcNAc moiety and low abundance of the O -GlcNAcylated proteins pose significant challenges in direct utilization of mass spectrometry for O -GlcNAcylation profiling 1,5,6 . Different enrichment methods are needed to protect and stabilize the GlcNAc moiety. This unavoidably introduces bias in substrates preference intrinsic to the methods, which also contributes to the limited overlap of the identified O -GlcNAc substrates. As for our approach reported here, there are several potential caveats: (1) Similar to the direct capture methods, the sensitivity is limited compared to the chemoenzymatic labeling methods. Additionally, our method uses the differential enrichment in the TurboID- Cp OGA CD experimental group relative to the TurboID- Cp OGA DM control group to identify putative O -GlcNAc substrates. Therefore, the sensitivity is also influenced by the cutoff chosen in the analysis. (2) Our method relies on ectopic expression of bacterial Cp OGA mutants fused with TurboID to label the O -GlcNAcome. The introduction of these foreign proteins could impose stress on the targeted tissue and interfere with its normal functions. Therefore, we included Cp OGA DM as a control in all the experiments to minimize possible artifacts. (3) The TurboID used in our method can biotinylate all the proximal proteins within ~ 10 nm radius. As a result, the identified proteins can be in complex with other O -GlcNAc substrates but itself is not directly O -GlcNAcylated. To be accurate, we used \u201cputative\u201d or \u201ccandidate\u201d substrates and O -GlcNAc \u201cinteractome\u201d in our description. We have updated the Introduction and Discussion to include these aforementioned points. 2) The current data do not rule out the possibility that altering GlcNAc affects LTM through a mechanism independent of ribosome modification and/or activity dependent translational control. It should be clearly acknowledged in the abstract and discussion that the data fall short of causally connecting ribosomal protein modification with translational control required for LTM. Phrases like \"consistent with\" may be useful. We appreciate that you bring up this crucial point. Our study demonstrated that: (1) hypo- O- GlcNAcylation resulted in learning defect and reduced protein synthesis in mushroom body; (2) knockdown of several ribosomal subunits to reduce protein synthesis in mushroom body was sufficient to drive learning defect; (3) upregulation of protein synthesis by overexpression of dMyc in mushroom body ameliorated the cognitive defect caused by hypo- O- GlcNAcylation. These observations consolidated a link between hypo- O- GlcNAcylation and cognitive impairment in Drosophila , and suggested that insufficient O- GlcNAcylation in the mushroom body of Drosophila brain reduced local translational activity that contributed to the observed olfactory learning deficits. However, our data indeed fall short for a causal connection between O -GlcNAcylation of ribosomes and translational activity. In fact, our profiling also identified many translational initiation factors whose O -GlcNAcylation could impact translation as well. Therefore, your point has been well taken, and we have made the following changes accordingly: (1) we changed the Title of our manuscript to put more emphasis on the method itself; (2) we replaced \u201cribosomal activity\u201d with \u201ctranslational activity\u201d in all the texts to describe the findings more accurately; (3) we used words like \u201csuggest\u201d and \u201cconsistent with\u201d to emphasize it is one of the explanations whenever possible; (4) we specifically pointed out in the Discussion that the impact of O -GlcNAcylation on ribosomal activity needs future structural and biochemical characterizations. We think these changes have greatly improved the accuracy of our description, and we want to express our gratitude again for this suggestion. 3) Please respond carefully and as you consider appropriate all of the other comments of the reviewers. We have prepared a point-by-point response to all the comments, and we express our sincere appreciation to you for the meticulous evaluation of our manuscript. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): 1. This study relies almost exclusively on the over-expression of foreign proteins and interpreting their effects based solely on their known affinity and activity for O-GlcNAc modifications. The effects of high levels of over-expression are often hard to identify or know and while there are appropriate controls in their studies, using catalytically inactive mutant forms for comparison, there is no discussion of this issue. The authors do describe that over-expression in optic and antennal lobes for example, provided reason for exclusion by virtue of differences in susceptibility (that term is not explained), indicating there are behavioral effects that can interfere with their assays. Some direct discussion of this potential problem is warranted. Thank you for this valuable advice. The reason we chose a bacterial OGA to manipulate O -GlcNAcylation levels in flies are following. First, the function of OGA is highly conserved during evolution ( Author response image 1 ). The N-terminal O -GlcNAc hydrolase catalytic domain of Cp OGA has sequence homology to Drosophila OGA 7,8 . Previous studies have shown that Cp OGA exhibits remarkable catalytic activity on Drosophila O -GlcNAcylated proteins 9 . We have codon-optimized CpOGA sequence to Drosophila , and constructed the transgenic flies. Second, the first insight into the structure of OGA catalytic domain came from the crystal structure of Cp OGA 10 . Until now the structural information of Drosophila OGA is not available. The crystal structure of Cp OGA clearly reveals that the Asp298 residue is crucial for its catalytic activity, and Asp401 residue for O- GlcNAc peptide binding. This structural and mechanistic information can guide the rational design of active or control OGA, as well as the TurboID-fused OGA mutants for profiling, during the generation of transgenic lines. Third, in OGT mutated patient-derived fibroblasts, the expression of OGA is often compensatorily downregulated via mechanisms that are currently not fully understood. We decided to use a bacterial OGA to bypass the potential feedback between OGT and OGA. Indeed, we found that the expression of Cp OGA WT in Drosophila reduced total O- GlcNAcylation level without altering the mRNA abundance of endogenous oga or sxc 11 . Author response image 1. Schematic of the domain structures of human OGA, Drosophila OGA, and Cp OGA. The O -GlcNAcase activity resides in the GH domain (blue). The C-terminal of Drosophila OGA harbors a putative histone acetyltransferase domain (HAT-like). Residues 31\u2013618 of Cp OGA (corresponding to the GH domain plus an additional C-terminal) are used in this study. As for the experiments in the optic and antennal lobes, we found ectopic expression of Cp OGA WT in these brain regions altered odor acuity toward MCH or OCT when compared with Cp OGA DM control. This difference in olfactory susceptibility invalidated the learning tests. Therefore, we excluded these flies from subsequent olfactory learning test. The reason why expression of Cp OGA WT in optic and antennal lobes impacted olfactory perception is not clear. We think the multisensory nature of Drosophila behavior and perception might be involved. Perhaps there are functional interactions between olfactory processing neuronal circuit and visual as well as sensory neuronal circuits. We have updated the Results and Discussion accordingly to accommodate the key points. 2. Their comparison of several methods of identifying O -GlcNAc-modified proteins was tested in HEK293 cells, providing a measure of their method of proximity-labelling using their Clostridium OGA construct. The set of proteins identified by all three tested methods revealed 48, a modest number compared to the total sets for each method (2119, 273 and 336) for chemoenzymatic, direct capture and TurboID- Cp OGA. This level of concordance suggests that different methods might well identify different sets of proteins, a concern for interpreting the functional significance of these changes. Do the authors argue that these results only affect sensitivity or could it possibly bias the classes of O -GlcNAc modified proteins identified? Thank you for raising this important issue. The possible reasons for the low overlap among datasets generated by different profiling methods are elaborated in Essential revisions 1. We have also updated the Introduction and Discussion accordingly. As for the question of whether it only affects sensitivity or introduces bias to different classes of substrates, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on these three datasets and found that they were enriched in similar biological processes (Figure S2E). Therefore, despite different enrichment strategies unavoidably introducing bias in substrate preference, we think the main classes of O -GlcNAcylated substrates from different profiling attempts remain comparable. 3. The rescue of associative learning phenotypes mediated by reductions in O -GlcNAc modification by over-expression of dMyc is a very important experiment that supports their conclusion that translational deficits are the basis of the learning defects. The authors should explain further in the text the rationale and basis for this experiment, namely, how dMyc affects the protein synthetic machinery and why these changes could rescue loss of O -GlcNAc modifications. Thank you for highlighting this point. One well-recognized function of MYC is to serve as a direct regulator of ribosome biogenesis, promoting protein synthesis through transcriptional control of RNA and protein components of ribosomes, as well as factors involved in processing and nuclear export of these ribosomal subunits 12-14 . MYC binds to sequences surrounding rDNA and directly promotes Pol I transcription throughout this region 15-17 . It also contributes to driving 5S transcription by Pol III 18 . These activities rely on the ability of MYC to both interact with the factors that promote Pol I recruitment to rDNA promoters and induce changes in local chromatin organization within rDNA repeats. Moreover, MYC directly enhances the transcription of key factors involved in rRNA transcription, such as UBF and components of the SL1 complex 16 . Furthermore, MYC boosts Pol II-mediated transcription of genes that encode ribosomal proteins 18-20 . The Drosophila dMyc, like its vertebrate homologs, activates numerous target genes associated with ribosome biogenesis and translation 12,21-24 . We think dMyc boosts ribosome biogenesis at transcription level, which compensates the reduced translational activity caused by the insufficient post-translational O -GlcNAc modification. We have updated the RESULTS to better explain the rationale for this experimental design. 4. The paper is challenging to read, and I suggest the authors provide it for reading and editing by someone not in their immediate field in order to make changes that make it more accessible to a general reader. Thank you for the suggestion. We have thoroughly edited the manuscript to make it more accessible to general readers. 5. Their graphics are terrific and provide great assistance in clarifying the figures. Well done. Thank you very much for the encouragement. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): As it stands the manuscript does not support the idea that O-GlcNAcylation of ribosomal proteins in the mushroom body (MB) is required for protein synthesis and olfactory learning. Experiments targeting specific ribosomal components could be a compelling demonstration. For example, Ser/Thr residues that get O-GlcNAcylated in RPL24 or RPS3 could be mutated. If these mutants showed learning defects it would be an important result. Same type of mutants in ex vivo OPP assays could be performed to determine their effect on protein synthesis. These types of experiments would definitely show specific requirement of ribosomal protein modification for ribosomal activity and associative learning. We agree that the current data fall short for a direct connection between O -GlcNAcylation of ribosomes and translational activity. Therefore, we have modified the TITLE and thoroughly edited the descriptions throughout the manuscript to assure accuracy (see Essential revisions 2). Because the whole translational machinery is heavily O -GlcNAcylated in the mushroom body, and our profiling method can not identify individual O -GlcNAcylation sites on the substrates, it is very difficult to design the mutational experiments as you suggested. Future biochemical and structural characterizations of ribosomes might reveal the key O -GlcNAcylation sites and verify the connection between O -GlcNAc modifications of ribosomes and their activity.

    "full_text_abstract": "O- GlcNAcylation is a dynamic post-translational modification that diversifies the proteome. Its dysregulation is associated with neurological disorders that impair cognitive function, and yet identification of phenotype-relevant candidate substrates in a brain-region specific manner remains unfeasible. By combining an O- GlcNAc binding activity derived from Clostridium perfringens OGA ( Cp OGA) with TurboID proximity labeling in Drosophila , we developed an O- GlcNAcylation profiling tool that translates O- GlcNAc modification into biotin conjugation for tissue-specific candidate substrates enrichment. We mapped the O- GlcNAc interactome in major brain regions of Drosophila and found that components of the translational machinery, particularly ribosomal subunits, were abundantly O- GlcNAcylated in the mushroom body of Drosophila brain. Hypo- O- GlcNAcylation induced by ectopic expression of active Cp OGA in the mushroom body decreased local translational activity, leading to olfactory learning deficits that could be rescued by dMyc overexpression-induced increase of protein synthesis. Our study provides a useful tool for future dissection of tissue-specific functions of O- GlcNAcylation in Drosophila , and suggests a possibility that O- GlcNAcylation impacts cognitive function via regulating regional translational activity in the brain.\n\neLife digest Newly synthesized proteins often receive further chemical modifications that change their structure and role in the cell. O -GlcNAcylation, for instance, consists in a certain type of sugar molecule being added onto dedicated protein segments. It is required for the central nervous system to develop and work properly; in fact, several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington\u2019s disease are linked to disruptions in O -GlcNAcylation. However, scientists are currently lacking approaches that would allow them to reliably identify which proteins require O -GlcNAcylation in specific regions of the brain to ensure proper cognitive health. To address this gap, Yu et al. developed a profiling tool that allowed them to probe O -GlcNAcylation protein targets in different tissues of fruit flies. Their approach relies on genetically manipulating the animals so that a certain brain area overproduces two enzymes that work in tandem; the first binds specifically to O -GlcNAcylated proteins, which allows the second to add a small \u2018biotin\u2019 tag to them. Tagged proteins can then be captured and identified. Using this tool helped Yu et al. map out which proteins go through O -GlcNAcylation in various brain regions. This revealed, for example, that in the mushroom body \u2013 the \u2018learning center\u2019 of the fly brain \u2013 O -GlcNAcylation occurred predominantly in the protein-building machinery. To investigate the role of O -GlcNAcylation in protein synthesis and learning, Yu et al. used an approach that allowed them to decrease the levels of O -GlcNAcylation in the mushroom body. This resulted in reduced local protein production and the flies performing poorly in olfactory learning tasks. However, artificially increasing protein synthesis reversed these deficits. Overall, the work by Yu et al. provides a useful tool for studying the tissue-specific effects of O -GlcNAcylation in fruit flies, and its role in learning. Further studies should explore how this process may be linked to cognitive function by altering protein synthesis in the brain."
