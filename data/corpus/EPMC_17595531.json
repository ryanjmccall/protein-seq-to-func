    "abstract_text": "PASKIN links energy flux and protein synthesis in yeast, regulates glycogen synthesis in mammals, and has been implicated in glucose-stimulated insulin production in pancreatic beta-cells. Using newly generated monoclonal antibodies, PASKIN was localized in the nuclei of human testis germ cells and in the midpiece of human sperm tails. A speckle-like nuclear pattern was observed for endogenous PASKIN in HeLa cells in addition to its cytoplasmic localization. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the multifunctional eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF1A1 as a novel interaction partner of PASKIN. This interaction was mapped to the PAS A and kinase domains of PASKIN and to the C-terminus of eEF1A1 using mammalian two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. Kinase assays, mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis revealed PASKIN auto-phosphorylation as well as eEF1A1 target phosphorylation mainly but not exclusively at Thr432. Wild-type but not kinase-inactive PASKIN increased the in vitro translation of a reporter cRNA. Whereas eEF1A1 did not localize to the nucleus, it co-localizes with PASKIN to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. The two proteins also showed a remarkably similar localization in the midpiece of the sperm tail. These data suggest regulation of eEF1A1 by PASKIN-dependent phosphorylation in somatic as well as in sperm cells.",
