    "abstract_text": "Previous analyses of the sirtuin family of histone deacetylases and its most prominent member SIRT1 have focused primarily on the identification of cellular targets exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of its implicated function in the control of metabolic homeostasis, differentiation, apoptosis and cell survival. So far, little is known about the regulation of SIRT1 itself. In the study presented herein, we assigned the main region of SIRT1 in vivo phosphorylation to amino acids 643-691 of the unique carboxy-terminal domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SIRT1 is a substrate for protein kinase CK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Both, deletion construct analyses and serine-to-alanine mutations identified SIRT1 Ser-659 and Ser-661 as major CK2 phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated in vivo as well.",
