  "abstract_text": "Costello syndrome (CS) is a developmental disorder characterized by postnatal reduced growth, facial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, mental retardation and skin and musculo-skeletal defects. CS is caused by HRAS germline mutations. In the majority of cases, mutations affect Gly(12) and Gly(13) and are associated with a relatively homogeneous phenotype. The same amino acid substitutions are well known as somatic mutations in human tumors and promote constitutive HRAS activation by impairing its GTPase activity. In a small number of cases with mild phenotype, a second class of substitutions involving codons 117 and 146 and affecting GTP/GDP binding has been described. Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of two different three-nucleotide duplications resulting in a duplication of glutamate 37 (p.E37dup) associated with a homogeneous phenotype reminiscent of CS. Ectopic expression of HRAS(E37dup) in COS-7 cells resulted in enhanced growth factor-dependent stimulation of the MEK-ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathways. Recombinant HRAS(E37dup) was characterized by slightly increased GTP/GDP dissociation, lower intrinsic GTPase activity and complete resistance to neurofibromin 1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) stimulation due to dramatically reduced binding. Co-precipitation of GTP-bound HRAS(E37dup) by various effector proteins, however, was inefficient because of drastically diminished binding affinities. Thus, although HRAS(E37dup) is predominantly present in the active, GTP-bound state, it promotes only a weak hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways. These findings provide evidence that the mildly enhanced signal flux through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT cascades promoted by these disease-causing germline HRAS alleles results from a balancing effect between a profound GAP insensitivity and inefficient binding to effector proteins.",
