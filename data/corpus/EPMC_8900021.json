  "abstract_text": "The major Thermomonospora fusca YX extracellular protease gene (tfpA) was cloned into Escherichia coli and Streptomyces lividans and was sequenced. The open reading frame encoded 375 residues, including a 31-residue potential signal sequence, an N-terminal prosequence containing 150 residues, and the 194-residue mature protease that belongs to the chymotrypsin family. The protease was secreted by S. lividans, but evidence suggested that it was bound to an extracellular protease inhibitor. An inhibitor-deficient mutant was selected to produce protease for purification.",
