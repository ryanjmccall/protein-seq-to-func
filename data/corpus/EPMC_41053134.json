In cancer, TERT stabilization leads to constitutive self-renewal preventing DNA damage response 2 . TERT is highly regulated and maintained to ensure survivability. TERT expression has been shown to be regulated by the E2F1 and c-Myc in previous studies as binding of these two proteins on TERT promoter induced TERT expression 3 , 4 . Our research group has also reported that the fusion oncoprotein, RUNX1/ETO directly regulates TERT in AML with t(8;21) translocation via binding on TERT enhancer region 3 . S-phase associated kinase 2 (SKP2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for attaching ubiquitin on protein targets meant for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway 5 . SKP2 also play pivotal roles in cell cycle progression by targeting CDKN1B for degradation driving the cell cycle forward 6 . Previously, we also observed that SKP2 destabilization occurred concomitantly with RUNX1/ETO knockdown and led to TERT suppression and a G1 phase cell cycle arrest in t(8,21) AML 3 . This prompted us to observe whether direct SKP2 destabilization could induce TERT suppression. Indeed, we observed TERT suppression upon SKP2 knockdown suggesting a direct SKP2 axis in TERT regulation 3 . Since SKP2 destabilization occurs under the influence of RUNX1/ETO in t(8,21) AML we sought to study whether SKP2 destabilization in AML subtypes lacking the t(8;21) translocation could also lead to TERT suppression. Results SKP2 knockdown in AML subtypes lacking T (8,21) translocation results in TERT suppression and TERT loss related phenotypic changes Since knockdown of RUNX1/ETO in t(8,21) destabilizes SKP2 and led to TERT suppression 3 , we sought to directly suppress SKP2 via siRNA mediated gene knockdown and the results show that SKP2 was successfully suppressed in AML cells lacking the t(8;21) translocation (THP-1 and HL-60) by specific siRNA targeting (Fig 1 A-B, F -G). Interestingly, in line with these changes we observed a reduction in TERT expression levels. Suppression of TERT occurred at both transcript and protein levels post SKP2 knockdown (Fig 1 C-D, H - I ) resulting in reduced telomerase activity (Fig 1 E, J ) suggesting a direct control over TERT by SKP2 in AML subtypes lacking the t(8;21) translocation. Additional phenotypic changes that were observed as a consequence of TERT loss upon SKP2 suppression include increased levels of senescent cells (Fig 2 A, C ) and a G1 phase cell cycle arrest (Fig 2 C, D ) in AML cells lacking the t(8;21) cells, further strengthening the notion that SKP2 is able to regulate TERT in these AML subtypes.

SKP2 knockdown resulted in accumulation Of CDKN1B and increased amounts of underphosphorylated RB CDKN1B accumulation trailed SKP2 knockdown in non t(8,21) AML (Fig 3 A, B ), This observation comes as no surprise since SKP2 targets CDKN1B for proteasomal degradation 5 , 6 , The accumulation of CDKN1B was also reflected by the G1 phase arrest observed earlier since CDKN1B binds cyclin to inhibit cell cycle progression 6 . Additionally, upon SKP2 knockdown, an increase in underphosphorylated RB was also observed. (Fig 3 C, E ). Furthermore, no changes in the levels E2F1 were observed (Fig 3 D, F ) post SKP2 suppression The increase in underphosphorylated RB suggests RB/E2F1 complex stabilization since RB phosphorylation is required to dissociate from E2F1 3 .

SKP2 mediated TERT expression is independent of the FOXO3/CMYC axis Since CMYC binds promoter of TERT 4 this prompted us to investigate whether the FOXO/CMYC axis 7 could be playing a role towards TERT suppression post SKP2 knockdown in non t(8,21) AML. No changes in the transcript levels of FOXO3a and CMYC was observed post SKP2 knockdown in THP-1 (Fig 4 A, C ). Interestingly, we observed CMYC protein upregulation (Fig 4 B) in parallel with FOXO3a downregulation (Fig 4 D) indicating that the FOXO3/CMYC axis is at play. However, MYC occupation on TERT promoter remain unchanged post SKP2 knockdown (Fig 4 E) indicating that TERT suppression is independent on the FOXO3a/CMYC axis despite observation of antagonistic interplay at the protein levels of FOXO3a and CMYC. Fig 4 Accumulation of CMYC post SKP2 suppression does not affect CMYC occupation on TERT promoter A , B ) CMYC transcript and protein levels 6 days post siSKP2 knockdown, right panel qPCR analyses, left panel western blot C , D ) FOXO3 transcript and protein levels 6 days post siSKP2 knockdown, right panel qPCR analyses, left panel western blot E ) ChIP-qPCR analyses showed no significant changes in CMYC occupation on TERT promoter (siSKP2; small interfering RNA targeting SKP2, siMM; small interfering RNA mismatch control. Error bars indicate standard deviation of three independent experiments). In-Silico data analysis in AML datasets show that SKP2 and TERT are generally up-regulated in AML Using publicly available primary AML datasets from bloodspot 8 and The National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons (GDC) 9 , we looked into several AML class available in the BEATAML1.0 cohort 10 from GDV, and an additional AML TCGA dataset (The Cancer Genome Atlas) 10 obtained from bloodspot 3.0 for SKP2 and TERT expression levels. Generally, SKP2 level is elevated in leukaemia in both BEATAML 1.0 cohort and AML TCGA datasets, with expression being highest within the t(8,21) AML class in both cohorts (Fig 5 A, B ). In contrast, elevated TERT levels was only observable in the AML TCGA dataset not the BEATAML1.0 (Fig 5 C). However, although high TERT expression levels was observed in t(8,21) especially in t(8,21)+other class, TERT expression levels are lower when compared to the T(15,17)+other, del(7q)/7q+other, del(5q)/5q and normal+other leukemic class. Fig 5 SKP2 and TERT levels across primary leukemia. A ) The BEATAML1.0 cohort showed high SKP2 expression in primary leukemic clinical samples. However, TERT levels remained low across leukemic class. B ) SKP2 levels are generally elevated in the TCGA AML datasets, SKP2 is especially high in t(8,21) leukemia, data obtained from bloodspot 3.0 C) TERT levels were also elevated across leukemia however levels of TERT in T(8,21) are lower compared to several leukemic class. Interestingly in t(8,21)+other leukemic class TERT expression was highest although sample size here are low. Data from the TCGA AML datasets was used and obtained via Bloodspot 3.0 Data from the BEATAML 1.0 cohort was obtained from National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons Data Portal. Discussion SKP2 crucial nature in maintenance of the leukemic state resulted in complex regulation enabling AML progression. SKP2 is among the components involved in the regulation of TERT. Previously, we found that SKP2 stabilization is mediated by the fusion gene RUNX1/ETO and that knockdown of RUNX1/ETO destabilizes SKP2 trailing TERT suppression 3 . Here, we sought to study this mechanism via direct SKP2 suppression in the absence of RUNX1/ETO influence in non t (8,21) AML model. SKP2 knockdown in non t(8,21) AML resulted in TERT suppression. TERT loss phenotypes following SKP2 knockdown in non t(8,21) AML were also noted and these included accumulation of cells at the G1 phase and an increase in senescent cells. SKP2 loss also trailed CDKN1B accumulation which was also observable in other leukemia following SKP2 suppression 11 . Concomitantly upregulation of underphosphorylated RB was also observed. Here, we could infer two possibilities. The first being that accumulation of CDKN1B resulted in TERT suppression, as we reported previously that CDKN1B could also associate with TERT promoter since this event trailed SKP2 downregulation and subsequent TERT suppression following RUNX1/ETO knockdown 3 . Thus, here, in non t(8,21) AML accumulation of CDKN1B occurred post SKP2 knockdown and is supported by the G1 phase cell cycle arrest and replicative senescence phenotypes. This could increase CDKN1B occupation of TERT promoter hence suppressing TERT. Secondly, since it was reported that CDKN1B could reduce phosphorylation of RB 12 and that E2F1 dissociation from the complex requires RB to be phosphorylated, the enrichment of underphosphorylated RB post SKP2 knockdown could suggest stabilization of the RB/E2F1 complex. Since the RB/E2F1 complex also plays crucial role in TERT expression via E2F1 dissociation from the RB complex and subsequent E2F1 association on TERT promoter 3 , 13 . This could indicate that the increase in underphosphorylated RB which is again supported by the G1 phase arrest contributes towards TERT suppression via increasing association with E2F1. Here, E2F1 level remains unchanged, thus stabilization of this complex would result in less free E2F1, thus reducing its occupancy on TERT promoter, which would trail TERT suppression as we have previously shown 3 . Therefore, this could hierarchically place CDKN1B above RB/E2F1 axis in SKP2 mediated TERT control. Supporting this notion, CDKN1B was also reported to act as inhibitor to TERT in cervical cancer by repressing the HPV E-protein 14 . Thus, the accumulation of CDKN1B post SKP2 knockdown could also contribute towards TERT suppression. Collectively, it can be said that TERT suppression is an event triggered by interactions between SKP2, CDKN1B and RB where SKP2 suppression led to the accumulation of CDKN1B which resulted in a G1 phase arrest and RB hypo-phosphorylation which eventually led to TERT suppression. Another interesting notion was observed between the levels of SKP2 and c-Myc, it was reported that c-Myc binds SKP2 gene for direct CDKN1B suppression in leukemic cells 11 . Here, since siSKP2 was used to suppress SKP2, c-Myc protein stabilization could be a compensatory mechanism to restore SKP2 since this leads to CDKN1B destabilization. Furthermore, an earlier study showed that MYC stability is dependent on SKP2 ubiquitylation 15 . In this case upregulation of c-Myc could also be attributed to SKP2 suppression besides FOXO3a antagonism. However, despite c-Myc upregulation TERT levels remain suppressed, pointing to the notion that TERT expression is dependent on SKP2 stabilization. Materials and methods Cell culture and gene knockdown THP-1 and HL-60 which are non t(8,21) acute myeloid leukemia models were cultivated in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) and Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 20% FBS respectively.

Conclusion and future outlooks In summary, we show here for the first time that in non t(8,21) AML, SKP2 could control telomerase activity directly by controlling TERT via accumulation of CDKN1B and hypo-phosphorylation of RB (Fig 6 ). Here, our results showed that SKP2 suppression in non t(8,21) models trailed TERT downregulation independent of RUNX1/ETO which translates to lower telomerase activity and the increase in senescent cells (Fig 1 C-E, H -J, Fig 2 A,C), Concomitantly, G1 phase cell cycle arrest also occurred post SKP2 knockdown due to the accumulation of CDKN1B (Fig 2 B,D, 3 A-B). Accumulation in underphosphorylated RB was also observed following SKP2 suppression (Fig 3 C,E) mimicking our previous findings with RUNX1/ETO suppression which could indicate RB/E2F1 complex stabilization 3 . Additionally, we also investigated c-Myc occupancy on TERT promoter post SKP2 knockdown and since no changes in c-Myc occupancy on TERT promoter was observed (Fig 4 E) despite c-Myc stabilization (Fig 4 B) we suggest that TERT suppression following SKP2 knockdown is independent of the FOXO3/c-Myc axis. This finding provides a novel notion for SKP2 in TERT maintenance as SKP2 could directly regulate TERT which indirectly implicates its role in self-renewal. Fig 6 Postulated Working Model. Previously we have elucidated TERT suppression trailed RUNX1/ETO knockdown and that this also resulted in SKP2 downregulation indicating that RUNX1/ETO is required for SKP2 stabilization. Moreover, knockdown or RUNX1/ETO resulted in accumulation of CDKN1B and underphosphorylated RB these events lead to TERT suppression. Here, we showed that in non t(8,21) AML SKP2 knockdown trailed TERT suppression indicating that SKP2 is crucial for TERT stabilization. Interestingly, this also leads to CDKN1B and underphosphorylated RB accumulation indicating similar axis independent of the RUNX1/ETO fusion gene. Although we observed the axis leading to TERT suppression upon SKP2 knockdown our findings here are still preliminary, further validations are needed to truly elucidate this mechanism. In vitro characterization in other AML models could be carried out to further strengthen the SKP2-TERT axis 28 whereas whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA seq) analysis 29 upon SKP2 suppression would be able to shed further insights regarding SKP2 related TERT suppression and other self -renewal mechanisms in AML. Several other assays such as sphere formation assay, clonogeniety, limiting dilution assays and evaluation of stemness markers can be carried out to establish the role of SKP2 in AML self-renewal. Additionally, ex - vivo experiments on primary sample could also be carried out to further validate this axis in clinical settings 30 , 31 . Here, we provide a fresh outlook on SKP2 function as this gene could potentially be directly targeted for AML alleviation in a clinical setting as in silico analysis of patient datasets show that SKP2 and TERT are generally up-regulated in AML. SKP2 could be targeted via pharmacologic intervention by readily available SKP2 inhibitors 32 . Since SKP2 affects self-renewal via accumulation of CDKN1B and underphosphorylated RB which ultimately lead to TERT suppression. This axis could also be observed upon SKP2 inhibitor usage to further ascertain that SKP2 mediated AML self-renewal. Alternatively, combinatorial approaches could be explored in which a specific form of targeted therapy is added to already known treatment regimes as reported by Zeng and group where BCR-ABL positive leukaemia cells were treated with Disulfiram (DSF) to induce ferroptosis by targeting GSK4 in addition to conventional treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 22 . In the case of AML, SKP2 inhibitors could be added to conventional chemotherapy regiments of cytarabine as a combinatorial approach. Nevertheless, this would require validation at both pre-clinical (in-vitro and in-vivo) and clinical trial (Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3) levels before any recommendations can be suggested for translational purposes. Statistical analyses Paired sample t-test was used to compare means between two sample. P-value of less than 0.05 is considered significant. Supplementary Information Supplementary Information.

  "plain_text": "SKP2 has been shown to be essential for cancer growth as SKP2 ubiquitinates various proteins. This event leads to the degradation of proteins crucial towards cancer development from which malignancy trailed. Here we investigated the role of SKP2 in TERT modulation in non t (8,21) AML. Previously, one of the underlying mechanisms of TERT control in t(8,21) AML was elucidated by our research group whereby RUNX1/ETO regulated TERT levels via stabilization of SKP2. Here, in non t(8,21) AML cell lines, direct suppression of SKP2 also led to TERT suppression and concomitant accumulation of CDKN1B. Moreover, SKP2 suppression led to an increase in levels of underphosphorylated RB while no changes in E2F1 levels were observed. Additionally, inverse correlation was observed between FOXO3 (reduced) and c-Myc (increased) protein levels post SKP2 suppression indicating compensatory MYC activation of TERT. However, no changes in MYC occupation on TERT promoter was observed following SKP2 suppression and TERT remain suppressed thus subjugating the notion of TERT related MYC compensatory mechanisms. Collectively, the results of this study show that SKP2 regulate TERT levels independently of RUNX1/ETO in AML subtypes lacking the t(8;21) translocation directly via CDKN1B and RB phosphorylation states.
