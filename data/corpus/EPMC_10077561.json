  "abstract_text": "Disaggregation of the spherical nuclear bodies termed promyelocytic (PML) oncogenic domains (PODs) is a characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that the cAMP enhancer binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) associates with PML in vitro and is recruited to the PODs in vivo. Through its association with CBP, wild-type PML dramatically stimulates nuclear receptor transcriptional activity. These results demonstrate that a fraction of CBP is compartmentalized to the POD through its association with PML and thus suggest that PML and other POD-associated proteins may play an unexpectedly broad role in aspects of transcriptional regulation and human disease.",
