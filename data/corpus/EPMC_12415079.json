  "abstract_text": "Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a disease which causes significant morbidity and mortality. The two main forms of treatment for this disease include radical cystectomy and radical radiotherapy, but five year survival after treatment remains low at 40%. Many clinical and molecular risk factors have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. One such factor is the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed by many epithelial tumours, including bladder cancers. There are several methods of inhibiting the activity of EGFR and it may be that use of an anti-EGFR therapy, in combination with more conventional treatment, provides a method of improving the prognosis for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.",
