    "abstract_text": "A single-base substitution in the coding region of the androgen receptor (AR) gene caused complete androgen insensitivity in a patient with 46,XY karyotype. The mutation was a T-to-G transition in exon 6 and changed the codon 807 from ATG (methionine) to AGG (arginine) in the hormone-binding domain of the protein. The mutation was inserted into the wild-type human AR cDNA and the resulting cDNA expressed in CV-1 cells. Native and mutated AR proteins synthesized in recipient cells had identical molecular masses. Ligand-binding activity of the mutant receptor was less than 5% of that of the wild-type AR. The mutant's interaction with an androgen-response element in vitro was identical to that of the native aporeceptor; however, it did not transactivate a reporter gene construct in transfected CV-1 cells. Androgen insensitivity in our patient was thus due to altered structure of the receptor's steroid-binding region, which prevented the mutated AR from gaining a transcriptionally active form in vivo.",
