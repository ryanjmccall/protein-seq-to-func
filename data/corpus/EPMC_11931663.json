    "abstract_text": "In addition to their catalytic functions, cytosolic glutathioneS-transferases (GSTs) are a major reserve of high-capacity binding proteins for a large variety of physiological and exogenous non-substrate compounds. This ligandin function has implicated GSTs in numerous ligand-uptake, -transport and -storage processes. The binding of non-substrate ligands to GSTs can inhibit catalysis. In the present study, the energetics of the binding of the non-substrate ligand 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS) to wild-type human class Alpha GST with two type-1 subunits (hGSTA1-1) and its DeltaPhe-222 deletion mutant were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry. The stoichiometry of binding to both proteins is one ANS molecule per GST subunit with a greater affinity for the wild-type (K(d)=65 microM) than for the DeltaPhe-222 mutant (K(d)=105 microM). ANS binding to the wild-type protein is enthalpically driven and it is characterized by a large negative heat-capacity change, DeltaC(p). The negative DeltaC(p) value for ANS binding indicates a specific interface with a significant hydrophobic component in the protein-ligand complex. The negatively charged sulphonate group of the anionic ligand is apparently not a major determinant of its binding. Phe-222 contributes to the binding affinity for ANS and the hydrophobicity of the binding site.",
