    "abstract_text": "Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 (Hic-5), belongs to the group III LIM domain protein family and contains four carboxyl-terminal LIM domains (LIM1-LIM4). In addition to its role in focal adhesion signaling, Hic-5 acts in the nucleus as a coactivator for some steroid hormone receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR). Based upon its effect on AR transactivation, Hic-5 has also been designated as ARA55. Here, we report mapping studies of Hic-5/ARA55 functional domains and establish that LIM3 and LIM4 are necessary for maximal effects on GR transactivation. However, results from yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that these two LIM domains together, while necessary, are not sufficient to interact with the tau2 transactivation domain of GR. LIM4 also functions as a nuclear matrix targeting sequence (NMTS) for Hic-5/ARA55, as it is both necessary and sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the nuclear matrix. Thus, as suggested from previous analysis of LIM domain-containing proteins, separate but highly related LIM domains serve distinct functions.",
