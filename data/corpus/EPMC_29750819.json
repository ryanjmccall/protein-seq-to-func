BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutational profile and prevalence in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) probands from Southern Brazil: Are international testing criteria appropriate for this specific population? There is an error in the XML that is causing the fourteenth author\u2019s name, Ida Vanessa D. Schwartz, to be indexed incorrectly. The name should be indexed as Schwartz, IVD. There is an error in the seventh sentence of the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section. The correct sentence is: Therefore, it is surprising that in our population 2.5% of all carriers were double heterozygotes besides one patient carrying two BRCA2 pathogenic variants. In the Author Contribution section, B\u00e1rbara Alemar (BA) should be listed as one of the persons who took part in the conceptualization of the paper.
