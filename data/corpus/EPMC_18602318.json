  "abstract_text": "Autosomal dominant episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) results from mutations of the CACNA1A gene. We describe EA2 with unusual features in a father and daughter with a novel CACNA1A mutation coding for Y248C. Both patients showed severe cerebellar atrophy in MRI and clinical signs of progressive spinocerebellar atrophy type 6. Most disabling were the very frequent episodes of ataxia with migraine (with aura in the father and without aura in the daughter) and nystagmus in our patients. Additionally, they suffered from ictal hyperhidrosis with acute hypothermia of the extremities. Lastly, the father presented with interictal chronic diarrhea not associated to a known primary gastrointestinal disorder. Both ictal hyperhidrosis and interictal diarrhea ameliorated upon acetazolamide intake, the typical treatment for EA2. The significance of these findings is discussed and the phenotype correlated to previously reported cases.",
