  "abstract_text": "The peptide hormones, prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH), are known to regulate numerous target tissues. Among such targets are cells of the immune system, including T cells, B cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. We have cloned a panel of PRL- and GH-inducible T cell genes for use in studies to understand how these hormones through the expression of these genes modulate the biology of immune function cells. This article focuses on the signalling pathways emanating from the PRL receptor (PRL-R) and GH receptor (GH-R), and the expression of PRL-inducible target genes.",
