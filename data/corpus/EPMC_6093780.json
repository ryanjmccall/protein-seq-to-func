  "abstract_text": "Complementary DNA corresponding to total poly(A)+-RNA from the human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cell line was cloned in the phage expression vector lambda gt 11. An epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor cDNA clone was obtained by screening of the expression library with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (IgG), raised to the purified A431 EGF receptor, in combination with [125I]protein A of S. aureus. The cloned cDNA was able to select, by hybridization, messenger RNA which was translated in Xenopus oocytes and yielded an immunoprecipitable EGF receptor protein of Mr = 160,000. The insert of this cDNA (phEGFR-1), is approximately 880 base pairs in length and encodes the carboxyterminal portion of the EGF receptor protein. Its sequence is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates as shown by hybridization to unique chromosomal DNA sequences from human, baboon, dog, rat, mouse and frog.",
