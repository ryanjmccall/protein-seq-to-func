  "abstract_text": "Mutations in VCP have been reported to account for a spectrum of phenotypes that include inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and 1-2% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We identified a novel VCP mutation (p.Glu185Lys) segregating in an autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 family. Functional studies showed that the Glu185Lys variant impaired autophagic function leading to the accumulation of immature autophagosomes. VCP mutations should thus be considered for genetically undefined Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.",
