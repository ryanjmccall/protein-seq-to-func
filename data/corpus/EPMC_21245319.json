  "title": "Methyltransferase Set7/9 regulates p53 activity by interacting with Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1).",

  "abstract_text": "Numerous studies indicate that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC), plays a crucial role in p53-mediated stress responses by deacetylating p53. Nevertheless, the acetylation levels of p53 are dramatically increased upon DNA damage, and it is not well understood how the SIRT1-p53 interaction is regulated during the stress responses. Here, we identified Set7/9 as a unique regulator of SIRT1. SIRT1 interacts with Set7/9 both in vitro and in vivo. In response to DNA damage in human cells, the interaction between Set7/9 and SIRT1 is significantly enhanced and coincident with an increase in p53 acetylation levels. Importantly, the interaction of SIRT1 and p53 is strongly suppressed in the presence of Set7/9. Consequently, SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 is abrogated by Set7/9, and p53-mediated transactivation is increased during the DNA damage response. Of note, whereas SIRT1 can be methylated at multiple sites within its N terminus by Set7/9, a methylation-defective mutant of SIRT1 still retains its ability to inhibit p53 activity. Taken together, our results reveal that Set7/9 is a critical regulator of the SIRT1-p53 interaction and suggest that Set7/9 can modulate p53 function indirectly in addition to acting through a methylation-dependent mechanism.",
