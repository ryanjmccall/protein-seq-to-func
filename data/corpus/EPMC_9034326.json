    "abstract_text": "We report the sequence of a 4.5-kb cDNA clone isolated from a human melanoma library which bears high amino acid sequence identity to the yeast mitochondrial (mt) DNA polymerase (Mip1p). This cDNA contains a 3720-bp open reading frame encoding a predicted 140-kDa polypeptide that is 43% identical to Mip1p. The N-terminal part of the sequence contains a 13 glutamine stretch encoded by a CAG trinucleotide repeat which is not found in the other DNA polymerases gamma (Pol gamma). Multiple amino acid sequence alignments with Pol gamma from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Pichia pastoris, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis and Mus musculus show that these DNA polymerases form a family strongly conserved from yeast to man and are only loosely related to the Family A DNA polymerases.",
