  "abstract_text": "A procedure that combined ion exchange, gel permeation, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP-3) affinity chromatography with chromatofocusing and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography was used to isolate high molecular weight precursors of human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) from acetic acid extracts of Cohn fraction IV1. Two precursors had isoelectric points (pI) of 5.1 and 5.4 and apparent Mr values of 15,000 and 11,500, respectively. An apparent Mr = 16,000 RLPG/Ser29 variant of IGF-II was also identified in the acetic acid extracts. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of the major E domain-containing peptide that had been isolated from apparent Mr = 15,000 IGF-II (pI 5.1), following its digestion with the endoprotease Lys-C, indicated the carboxyl terminus of this precursor was near or at Lys88. During the sequencing of this peptide, a sharply reduced yield of derivatized amino acid occurred at cycle 10, indicating that Thr75 had been posttranslationally modified, possibly by O-glycosylation. To evaluate this possibility, the 125I-labeled high molecular weight IGF-IIs and their endoprotease-generated peptides were treated with glycosidases, and their effects were determined from the change in relative mobilities of the polypeptide and peptides during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Neuraminidase treatment of apparent Mr = 15,000 and 11,500 IGF-II reduced their Mr values to a common value of 10,500. When the desialylated precursors of IGF-II were treated with O-glycosidase, but not when treated with N-glycosidase, the Mr values were reduced further to about 10,000. This was the Mr value that would be predicted for an unglycosylated form of precursor IGF-II that had a carboxyl-terminal end at or near Lys88. When the Ser66-Lys88 endoprotease-generated E domain peptides from pI5.1 and 5.4 high Mr IGF-II were treated with the glycosidases, they had relative mobility changes during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that were similar to those of the intact precursors. Finally, the association of O-linked oligosaccharide with the E domain peptide of IGF-II was confirmed by demonstrating the specificity of binding of the Ser66-Lys88 asialoglycopeptide to jackfruit lectin.",
