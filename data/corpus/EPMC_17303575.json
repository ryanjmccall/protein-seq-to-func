    "abstract_text": "Although important for cellular stress signaling pathways, the molecular mechanisms of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activation remain poorly understood. Previous studies showed that treatment of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells with the potent protein kinase C (PKC) agonist, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), induces a transient drop in sphingomyelin concomitant with an increase in cellular ceramide levels (Becker, K. P., Kitatani, K., Idkowiak-Baldys, J., Bielawski, J., and Hannun, Y. A. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2606-2612). Here we show that PMA selectively activates ASMase and that ASMase accounts for the majority of PMA-induced ceramide. Pharmacologic inhibition and RNA interference experiments indicated that the novel PKC, PKCdelta, is required for ASMase activation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the formation of a novel PKCdelta-ASMase complex after PMA stimulation, and PKCdelta was able to phosphorylate ASMase in vitro and in cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identify serine 508 as the key residue phosphorylated in response to PMA. Phosphorylation of Ser(508) proved to be an indispensable step for ASMase activation and membrane translocation in response to PMA. The relevance of the proposed mechanism of ASMase regulation is further validated in a model of UV radiation. UV radiation also induced phosphorylation of ASMase at serine 508. Moreover, when transiently overexpressed, ASMase(S508A) blocked the ceramide formation after PMA treatment, suggesting a dominant negative function for this mutant. Taken together, these results establish a novel direct biochemical mechanism for ASMase activation in which PKCdelta serves as a key upstream kinase.",
