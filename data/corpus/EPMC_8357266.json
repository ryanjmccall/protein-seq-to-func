  "abstract_text": "The upstream sequences of all published lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase genomic clones from Phanerochaete chrysosporium were analyzed. This analysis revealed the presence of putative activator protein-2 (AP-2) recognition sequences in 11 of 15 lignin peroxidase genes. The lignin peroxidase clone GLG6 and the manganese peroxidase gene (mnp-1) have two copies of putative AP-2 sequence in the upstream region. Interestingly, the lignin peroxidase gene VLG4 of another white rot fungus, Trametes versicolor, and the nit-2 gene of Neurospora crassa also contain putative AP-2-binding sequences. Since all of these genes are regulated by nutrient nitrogen, I hypothesize that an AP-2-like transcription factor may be involved in inducing gene expression during nitrogen limitation in fungi.",
