  "abstract_text": "1. The hydrolysis of organophosphate pesticides (OP) and nerve gases by serum paraoxonase (PON1) is an important factor determining their toxicity to mammals including man. The PON1 gene contains 2 polymorphic sites at amino acid positions 55 (L-->M) and 192 (G-->A, classically defined as the A and B genotypes) which result in several alloenzymes of PON1 in human serum. 2. The 192 polymorphism has previously been shown to affect PON1 activity. We have investigated the effect of both polymorphisms on the hydrolysis of paraoxon by serum from 279 healthy human subjects. 3. The 55 polymorphism significantly influenced PON1 activity. MM homozygotes had over 50% less activity towards paraoxon compared to the LL and LM genotypes regardless of the 192 genotype (P < 0.001). 4. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the 192 polymorphism, 55 polymorphism and serum PON1 concentration were responsible for 46, 16 and 13% of the variation in PON1 activity, respectively (all P < 0.001). None of the other parameters investigated significantly affected PON1 activity. 5. Therefore both PON1 polymorphisms affect the hydrolysis of paraoxon. AA/MM and AB/MM individuals may be potentially more susceptible to OP intoxication. 6. Genotyping individuals for both PON1 polymorphisms may provide a method for identifying those individuals at most risk of OP poisoning. The effect of PON1 polymorphisms on activity may also explain why some Gulf War Veterans have developed Gulf War Syndrome and some have not.",
