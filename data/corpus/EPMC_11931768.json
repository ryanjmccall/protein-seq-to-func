  "abstract_text": "The corepressors N-CoR and SMRT partner with histone deacetylases (HDACs) in diverse repression pathways. We report here that GPS2, a protein involved in intracellular signaling, is an integral subunit of the N-CoR-HDAC3 complex. We have determined structural motifs that direct the formation of a highly stable and active deacetylase complex. GPS2 and TBL1, another component of the N-CoR-HDAC3 complex, interact cooperatively with repression domain 1 of N-CoR to form a heterotrimeric structure and are indirectly linked to HDAC3 via an extended N-CoR SANT domain that also activates latent HDAC3 activity. More importantly, we show here that the N-CoR-HDAC3 complex inhibits JNK activation through the associated GPS2 subunit and thus could potentially provide an alternative mechanism for hormone-mediated antagonism of AP-1 function.",
