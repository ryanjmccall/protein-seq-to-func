    "abstract_text": "We demonstrate here that the human oestrogen receptor (hER) cDNA clone pOR8 obtained from MCF-7 cells contains an artefactual point mutation which results in the substitution of a valine for a glycine at amino acid position 400 (Gly-400----Val-400). This mutation in the hormone binding domain of the cloned hER destabilizes its structure and decreases its apparent affinity for oestradiol at 25 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, when compared with the wild-type hER with a Gly-400.",
