[Correction added on 22 August 2025, after first online publication: The article category has been added.] Clinical case The patient, a 60\u2010year\u2010old man, presents with a six\u2010hour history of right big toe pain and swelling. He awoke overnight with a throbbing sensation in the toe and, over one hour, developed intense pain, redness, heat, and swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever experienced (9 of 10 in severity). He is unable to move the joint, take weight on his foot, or put on a shoe. The day before, he celebrated his 60th birthday with a round of golf and a large meal. He had an episode of joint pain and swelling in the left ankle six months ago, which was treated with naproxen and resolved after one week. He usually has no joint pain. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. Examination shows that he is distressed with the pain. There is exquisite tenderness, swelling, warmth, and erythema of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. He is unable to bear weight on the right foot. The other joints examine normally. There is a small white nodule (tophus) on the helix of the left ear. Laboratory test findings show a C\u2010reactive protein level of 68 mg/L (reference range <5 mg/L) and a neutrophil count of 12.3 \u00d7 10 9 /L (reference range 1.9\u20137.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L). The serum urate level measures 8.0 mg/dL (reference range 3.3\u20137.0 mg/dL). Point\u2010of\u2010care ultrasound shows a double contour sign, together with grade 3 synovial hypertrophy and color Doppler signal at the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. At the left first metatarsophalangeal joint, a double contour sign is also present, together with a tophus and adjacent bone erosion at the medial metatarsal head. Histopathology of gout flare The gout flare represents the prototypical acute inflammatory response. At high concentrations, urate precipitates and is deposited in joints and soft tissues, where it forms crystals of monosodium urate (MSU). 1 Deposition of MSU crystals alone may not cause any symptoms, but these crystals can induce intermittent episodes of acute inflammation (gout flares). 2 , 3 Hence, the first presentation of gout is often intense pain and inflammation in a joint that persists for several days before self\u2010resolving over one to two weeks. 4 Symptoms of gout flare occur in parallel with a rapid increase in leucocyte numbers in synovial fluid. 3 In the synovial membrane, there is prominent neutrophilic infiltration as well as perivascular infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes, and small amounts of plasma cells. 5 MSU crystals are often evident within neutrophils and synovial lining cells in synovial fluid, 5 and cell fragments as well as intact neutrophils are present within macrophage phagosomes. 5 Immune mechanisms of gout flare Like all acute inflammatory responses, there are three broad stages of gout flare: initiation, leucocyte mobilization, and self\u2010resolution. Initiation: The central role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of mature interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2) from monocytes and macrophages is central to initiation of gout flare. 6 , 7 The NLRP3 inflammasome is normally activated in response to tissue damage or pathogen attack. However, MSU crystals can act on some or all of the mechanisms driving NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and this underlies the reason why MSU crystal deposition predisposes to gout flare. 8 , 9 The NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in numerous health conditions. In rheumatology practice, a direct pathogenic role for NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been most convincingly demonstrated in inflammation related to gout, 6 calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, 6 and cryopyrin\u2010associated periodic syndromes 10 and has been implicated in a range of chronic rheumatic diseases. 7 The NLRP3 inflammasome is a large multiprotein complex made up of three proteins: NLRP3, which is a cytosolic receptor sensing internal cell stress; ASC, an adapter protein; and caspase 1, the effector protein of the inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome directly drives maturation (activation) and secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018. 6 , 11 NLRP3 inflammasome formation is a sequential process involving oligomerization of NLRP3, followed by recruitment of ASC and caspase 1, resulting in formation of a wheel\u2010like structure with caspase 1 at the center 12 (Figure 1A ). Mitochondria have a critical role in inflammasome assembly. 13 , 14 For instance, NLRP3 uses a microtubule\u2010dependent process to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum toward the mitochondria, where ASC is localized. 13 NLRP3 and ASC assemble together on mitochondria\u2010associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes. 13 Similarly, both caspase 1 and NLRP3 interact with phospholipids in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and this facilitates caspase 1 recruitment to the inflammasome. 14 Caspase 1 is produced in an inactive \u201cpro\u201d form. Incorporation of caspase 1 into the inflammasome results in its activation by self\u2010cleavage. 15 Figure 1 Development and self\u2010resolution of the gout flare. A high urate level leads to deposition of MSU crystals in joints and soft tissues. Gout flares initiate as a result of activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome within tissue\u2010resident monocytes and macrophages. Inflammasome activation requires two signals (signal 1 and signal 2). MSU crystals can serve as both signals; however, they usually act as signal 2 and another factor (eg, alcohol, saturated fatty acids) serves as signal 1. NLRP3 inflammasome activation results in the production of IL\u20101\u03b2, the major inflammatory cytokine driving the gout flare. IL\u20101\u03b2 promotes the production of chemokines and other inflammatory mediators promoting mobilization of immune cells, particularly neutrophils, which are recruited to the affected joint. Neutrophils also produce IL\u20101\u03b2 as well as other inflammatory cytokines and contribute to the inflammatory response. Neutrophils undergo NETosis, which results in the release of NETs and increased inflammatory cytokine levels. With increasing NET production, NETs form aggregates (AggNETs). AggNETs sequester and degrade inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the inflammatory response and contributing to resolution of the gout flare. Apoptotic neutrophils are phagocytosed by macrophages and other neutrophils. This also leads to production of anti\u2010inflammatory mediators as well as TGF\u2010\u03b2. TGF\u2010\u03b2 promotes a switch in macrophage polarization to the pro\u2010resolving M2 state. M2 macrophages also produce anti\u2010inflammatory and pro\u2010resolving mediators, contributing to gout flare resolution. High levels of proinflammatory lipid mediators (for instance produced by neutrophils) trigger a class switch in lipid mediator production, resulting in production of pro\u2010resolving rather than proinflammatory mediators. These inhibit further neutrophil recruitment to the joint. During resolution of the gout flare, the composition of the coating of biologic material on MSU crystals within joints alters, and this is likely crucial for maintenance of the intercritical period. IL\u20101\u03b2, interleukin\u20101\u03b2; MSU, monosodium urate; NET, neutrophil elastase trap; TGF\u2010\u03b2, transforming growth factor \u03b2 Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.43215/abstract . Both IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 are also first produced as inactive proproteins. 16 Caspase 1 is required to produce the biologically active mature cytokines. 16 For instance, caspase 1 specifically cleaves the 31kDa pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2 protein at Tyr\u2010Val\u2010His\u2010Asp116/Ala117, releasing the 17.5kDa mature IL\u20101\u03b2 cytokine. 16 Mature IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 are released from monocytes and/or macrophages through membrane pores. 17 These pores are formed by insertion of cleavage products of the protein gasdermin D into the plasma membrane. 17 Gasdermin D pore formation triggers a form of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis, resulting in the release of cellular contents, including proinflammatory factors as well as factors that promote the eventual resolution of inflammation. 18 Caspase 1 is also the enzyme responsible for cleavage of gasdermin D. 17 , 19 . Therefore caspase 1 promotes both the maturation and the secretion of IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018. 12 , 13 , 15 Inflammasome formation and activation is highly regulated. It involves two steps, and in most cases, stimulation by two distinct signals (known as signal 1 and signal 2) is required to initiate both steps, enabling full inflammasome activation. 20 NLRP3 inflammasome priming Step 1 involves priming the inflammasome and readying it for activation. During step 1, the production of new inflammasome components is up\u2010regulated because of the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB. NF\u2010\u03baB promotes both NLRP3 , as well as pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2 transcription. 21 It can be activated by a variety of pathways, including pattern recognition receptors such as toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and inflammatory cytokine receptors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and IL\u20101 receptor. 22 Aside from increased production of inflammasome components, signal 1 stimuli also promote conditions that facilitate inflammasome assembly and an inflammatory state. For instance, TLR activation leads to a change in energy metabolism pathway usage in macrophages, promoting use of glycolysis, disrupting mitochondrial energy metabolism, and inhibiting the removal of damaged mitochondria, leading to accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). 23 , 24 , 25 The balance of pathways used for energy metabolism is a critical determinant of macrophage polarization, and high glycolysis usage is required for M1 polarization and an inflammatory response. 26 Priming stimuli also induce pathways, controlling the posttranslational modification of inflammasome components. For instance, TLR activation promotes deubiquitination of NLRP3 by a pathway independent of NF\u2010\u03baB but dependent on mtROS. Deubiquitination alone is insufficient to promote full inflammasome assembly but is essential for enabling NLRP3 oligomerization in the first step of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. 27 Normally, NLRP3 inflammasome priming is induced in response to pathogen attack, tissue damage, or inflammatory cytokines in the extracellular environment. TLRs are important for sensing pathogens and tissue damage, and members of the TLR family are activated by stimuli such as the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), single\u2010stranded RNA (present in some viruses), and tissue debris, such as remnants of extracellular matrix components. In the case of gout, MSU crystals can activate TLR (specifically TLR\u20102 and TLR\u20104), 8 promote metabolic reprogramming in macrophages leading to increased glycolysis, 28 and induce inflammasome priming. 8 However, their ability to prime the inflammasome is dependent on several factors, including the amount, size, and shape of the crystals. 29 Clinically, both increased MSU crystal deposition due to high urate concentrations and increased crystal dissolution (eg following initiation of urate\u2010lowering therapy) are associated with increased risk of gout flare. 30 , 31 One of the mechanisms for this increased flare risk may be due to increased availability of MSU crystals in the right form to induce NLRP3 inflammasome priming. Other factors may also facilitate the inflammasome priming ability of MSU crystals. For example, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inflammasome, and IL\u20101\u03b2 levels were found to be substantially reduced in germ\u2010free mice following MSU crystal exposure but restored following treatment with acetate, a short\u2010chain fatty acid normally produced by gut microbiota, implicating a potential role of fermentation products of gut microbiota in modulating the proinflammatory effects of MSU crystals. 32 Aside from MSU crystals, various other factors associated with increased risk of gout flare can also induce inflammasome priming. For instance, both alcohol and saturated fatty acids activate NF\u2010\u03baB by mechanisms dependent on TLR. 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 High urate levels can also promote NF\u2010\u03baB activation. 37 The ability of these factors to prime the inflammasome is likely central to their association with gout flare risk. NLRP3 inflammasome activation In most cases, signal 1 alone is insufficient to promote full inflammasome activation, and a second signal is also required. Signal 2 promotes full assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. At least part of the mechanism by which this occurs is through further posttranslational modification of inflammasome components. 27 In the case of gout, MSU crystal phagocytosis has been implicated as a major trigger driving step 2 of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation process. 38 However, how this leads to transmission of a signal to promote assembly and activation of the inflammasome componentry is only just beginning to be understood. In this respect, studies that have examined the processes driving inflammasome activation in response to other stimuli, such as pathogen attack or cell damage, have been instrumental in providing insight into the mechanisms involved in inflammasome assembly and activation in the context of gout. These studies have demonstrated that mtROS generation, cellular ionic imbalance, and extracellular ATP signaling through purinergic receptors drive NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase 1 activation, and this is likely through an interconnected mechanism. 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 Cell damage (particularly mitochondrial dysfunction and mtROS), lysosomal damage, and plasma membrane damage result in perturbation of cellular ion levels, for example, reduced intracellular potassium or chloride or intracellular calcium flux. 39 , 43 In LPS\u2010primed macrophages, caspase 1 activation and IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion were shown to be induced by the addition of a stimulus, which caused a change in cell osmolarity, indicating that cellular ion imbalance can provide signal 2 for inflammasome activation. A change in cellular ion balance also causes mitochondrial damage and mtROS production 41 and results in compensatory activation of ion channels to restore normal ion balance and maintain cell volume. 44 Activity of these ion channels results in activation of a signaling cascade, which promotes extracellular ATP production and purinergic receptor activation, leading to a calcium\u2010dependent signaling cascade that promotes inflammasome assembly. 44 mtROS also activate calcium signaling to promote NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. 41 Recent evidence indicates that cell volume\u2013regulating ion channels are also activated following MSU crystal exposure, and this contributes to the mechanism by which MSU crystals promote step 2 of the inflammasome activation process. 9 Specifically, MSU crystals were shown to activate leucine\u2010rich repeat\u2013containing 8 (LRRC8) anion channels, which in turn stimulated release of extracellular ATP and purinergic receptor activation, leading to calcium signaling\u2013dependent inflammasome activation as evidenced by IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion. Although yet to be demonstrated, it is likely that MSU crystal\u2013induced LRRC8 activation occurs as a consequence of MSU crystal phagocytosis because MSU crystal dissolution within phagosomes is believed to increase intracellular ion load. 9 MSU crystal phagocytosis can also induce lysosomal damage as a result of incomplete breakdown of phagocytosed crystals, leading to cellular ion imbalance. 45 Although ion imbalance has been clearly shown to have a major role in promoting inflammasome assembly and activation in response to MSU crystals, other mechanisms may also contribute, and this remains an evolving area of research. Rather than just acting in an additive manner, it seems likely that there is synergism between signal 1 and signal 2, and hence the effects of both signals together is more pronounced than the effects of either signal alone. For instance, TLR activation in signal 1 inhibits mitophagy, 24 the normal process by which damaged mitochondria are removed from a cell. 24 This may amplify mtROS generation by signal 2 stimuli by allowing damaged mitochondria to accumulate. Conversely, signal 2 may also enhance sensitivity to priming signals. As an example, some TLRs, such as TLR\u20102, have been shown to localize to the phagosome in macrophages, are activated by triggers present in the contents of the phagosome, and initiate inflammatory signaling from the internalized phagosome. 46 This raises the possibility that MSU crystal phagocytosis not only provides signal 2 for inflammasome activation but may also sensitize to priming by TLR. The potential synergism between signal 1 and signal 2 may be particularly relevant in the context of gout flares. MSU crystals are believed to predominantly provide signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in gout flare, whereas often another factor (eg, a dietary factor) is believed to serve as signal 1. It is possible that the presence of MSU crystals and/or the gout disease environment may sensitize to priming signals such that a factor that is normally only a weak priming signal for the inflammasome is a stronger stimuli in the context of gout. Several factors relevant to the gout disease environment have been shown to contribute to controlling the propensity for NLRP3 inflammasome activation as well as the extent of inflammation generated. For instance, high urate levels can amplify IL\u20101 signaling by reducing expression of the endogenous IL\u20101 receptor antagonist. 47 Therefore, high urate levels may exacerbate the NLRP3 inflammasome\u2013mediated inflammatory response. Low n\u20103 long\u2010chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake is associated with increased frequency of gout flares, 48 and n\u20103 LCPUFAs have been shown to suppress the ability of MSU crystals to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. 49 High\u2010density lipoproteins (HDLs) have also been shown to repress MSU crystal\u2013induced inflammation in mice. 50 Whether n\u20103 LCPUFAs and HDLs act to inhibit signal 1 or 2 specifically or whether they have broader effects on the inflammatory cascade is unclear. The involvement of mtROS in inflammasome regulation also means that factors that promote mitochondrial damage and ROS generation facilitate inflammasome activation. Of potential relevance to gout, high\u2010calorie consumption causes mitochondrial stress and increased mtROS production. 19 , 20 Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mtROS are also inherent features of metabolic syndrome disorders. 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 Additionally, increased activity of AMP\u2010activated protein kinase (AMPK), which drives the autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, 56 has been shown to repress NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inflammation in in vitro and in vivo models of gouty inflammation. 57 , 58 AMPK also inhibits glycolysis, 56 , 59 , 60 , promotes autophagy\u2010mediated degradation of inflammasomes, 61 and promotes M2 macrophage polarization. 57 Therefore, AMPK may act in multiple ways to repress the inflammatory response. Inflammasome activation results in rapid induction of an inflammatory response, which escalates over time. The initial inflammatory response is due to signal 1 and signal 2 controlling posttranslational modification of pre\u2010existing inflammasome components present within the cell. 17 Escalation of the inflammatory response occurs because of increased production of inflammasome components and hence increased NLRP3 inflammasome activity stimulated by signal 1. 17 This inflammatory response is further amplified during the mobilization phase. 62 Mobilization: Neutrophilic infiltration IL\u20101\u03b2 has a major role in facilitating the recruitment of other immune cells, particularly neutrophils, to the joint during gout fare. 62 IL\u20101\u03b2 triggers production of other inflammatory mediators, for example, IL\u20106, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, which together with chemokines promote proliferation and migration of immune cells. Consequently, neutrophils as well as monocytes accumulate within the joint. Like monocytes and macrophages, neutrophils are capable of phagocytosis, including phagocytosis of MSU crystals. 63 They can also produce IL\u20101\u03b2 via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, neutrophils can produce proteases that can activate IL\u20101\u03b2 independent of caspase 1, 64 and this is also important for gout flare inflammation. Inhibition of neutrophil IL\u20101\u03b2\u2013activating proteases by \u03b1 1 \u2010antitrypsin has been shown to substantially repress inflammation in a murine gout model. 65 Neutrophils produce high amounts of other inflammatory cytokines, for example, TNF\u03b1, IL\u20106, and IL\u20108, 63 and high amounts of ROS. 66 Both IL\u20101\u03b2 and ROS promote a type of neutrophil cell death termed NETosis. As MSU crystals promote ROS and IL\u20101\u03b2 formation, they also promote NETosis. 67 , 68 NETosis leads to the formation of neutrophil elastase traps (NETs), 69 which are extracellular fiber\u2010like structures made up of components of neutrophil granules, including enzymes, biocidal proteins, and nuclear material. 70 Normally NETs trap and incapacitate pathogens. In gout, NETs trap MSU crystals. 63 Initially, NETosis is proinflammatory, resulting in increased release of proinflammatory mediators. 70 As the inflammatory response progresses, neutrophil numbers and the extent of NET production become so great that the NETs form aggregates (aggNETs). 63 aggNET formation contributes to flare resolution. 63 Self\u2010resolution Inflammation is designed to be self\u2010limiting, and even without treatment, gout flares will self\u2010resolve. Many of the mechanisms that stimulate the inflammatory response also activate pathways to resolve it. For instance, caspase 1 self\u2010cleavage activates caspase 1 but also destabilizes it, resulting in its rapid degradation. 15 TLR signaling promotes inflammasome activation but also promotes production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL\u201037. These anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines act by a feedback mechanism to inhibit inflammasome activity. 71 Although MSU crystals can induce NF\u2010\u03baB activation, they also up\u2010regulate expression of peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), 72 a ligand\u2010dependent transcription factor that strongly represses NF\u2010\u03baB target genes. 73 Neutrophil influx into the joint exacerbates the inflammatory response in gout flare but also promotes resolution. As neutrophils undergo apoptosis at the end of their life cycle, they are phagocytosed by macrophages 74 and other neutrophils, 75 triggering production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines and transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21). 75 TGF\u03b21 represses ROS and IL\u20101\u03b2 production 75 and up\u2010regulates IL\u201037, dampening the inflammatory response. 71 TGF\u03b21 also promotes a switch in macrophage polarization from proinflammatory M1\u2010like macrophages to anti\u2010inflammatory or pro\u2010resolving M2\u2010like macrophages. 76 M2\u2010like macrophages have greater phagocytotic activity, produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, and secrete high amounts of anti\u2010inflammatory or pro\u2010repair mediators, such as IL\u201010 and TGF\u03b2, than M1\u2010like macrophages. 77 M2 macrophages also fail to up\u2010regulate NLRP3 inflammasome expression following stimulation with LPS, a classic TLR activator, indicating that M2 macrophages do not activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to stimuli. 78 aggNET formation also contributes to gout flare resolution. aggNETs sequester and inactivate proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines (including IL\u20101\u03b2), thereby removing the signals that drive further immune cell recruitment to the joint. 63 A class switch in lipid mediator production by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) also contributes to reducing signals, promoting immune cell recruitment. Instead of producing proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes, LOX and COX switch to producing anti\u2010inflammatory lipoxins 79 as well as n\u20103 LCPUFA\u2013derived anti\u2010inflammatory or pro\u2010resolving lipid mediators, for example, maresins and resolvins. 80 , 81 Both maresins and resolvins are potent inhibitors of neutrophil migration, 80 , 81 and synovial fluid levels of pro\u2010resolving lipid mediators are negatively correlated with extent of joint inflammation in gout. 82 Maintenance of MSU crystals in a noninflammatory state during intercritical gout Although the symptoms of the flare fully dissipate on resolution, MSU crystals persist in the joint. 83 , 84 MSU crystal deposits within joints attract a coating of biologic material, at least some of which is due to the trapping of MSU crystals in aggNETs. 63 , 85 The composition of the MSU crystal coating has been shown to differ considerably during the inflammatory phase of gout flare compared to during flare resolution. 85 The composition of this coating likely influences whether crystals are proinflammatory. In support, type II collagen has been found to be associated with MSU crystals in synovial fluid in individuals with gout following joint injury. This collagen coating promoted MSU crystal\u2013mediated activation of NF\u2010\u03baB by TLR\u20102. 86 Similarly, coating MSU crystals with serum proteins such as albumin was shown to reduce their ability to induce IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion and to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and extracellular ATP secretion. 87 The composition of the coating on MSU crystals therefore may influence their ability to serve as signal 1 and potentially also signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The role of MSU crystals during development, progression, and self\u2010resolution of gout flare, as well as during the intercritical period, is summarized in Figure 1 . Maintenance of MSU crystals in the clinically uninflamed tophus The tophus presents clinically as a \u201cdraining or chalk\u2010like subcutaneous nodule under transparent skin, often with overlying vascularity.\u201d 88 In contrast to gout flare, tophi appear clinically uninflamed and nontender. Histopathologically, tophi are organized chronic granulomatous lesions with islands of tightly packed MSU crystals surrounded by a cellular \u201ccorona zone,\u201d which is in turn encased by an outer fibrovascular zone. In the corona zone, mononucleated and multinucleated macrophages predominate. Although numerous IL\u20101\u03b2\u2013positive cells are present within the corona zone, 89 it seems likely that other factors contribute to the lack of clinically evident inflammation within these lesions; this may be due to lack of IL\u20101\u03b2 released into the extracellular compartment, increased production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines or IL\u20101 inhibitors in vivo, or rapid degradation of IL\u20101\u03b2 following its release by aggNETs. The architecture of the tophus, with its collagen\u2010rich fibrovascular zone, may also play a role in separating MSU crystals from other cells and tissues, allowing the crystals to remain in a relatively uninflamed state. Targeted treatment and prevention of gout flare? Traditional treatment options for gout flare include colchicine, glucocorticoids, and nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The mechanisms of action of these medications are summarized in Table 1 . Despite the different mechanisms of action, in head\u2010to\u2010head clinical trials, traditional therapies have similar clinical efficacy for treatment of gout flare. 90 , 91 Table 1 Anti\u2010inflammatory mechanisms of medications used to treat gout flares * Therapeutic class Anti\u2010inflammatory mechanisms Colchicine Inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activity and neutrophil mobilization 92 , 93 Inhibits microtubule formation (essential for the transport of NLRP3 components during inflammasome assembly and for cell migration 93 ) Promotes AMPK activation 57 Reduces expression of adhesion molecules on neutrophils and inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis 108 , 109 Inhibits ROS production by neutrophils 94 Inhibits NET formation 95 Glucocorticoids Inhibit proliferation, migration, and maturation of immune cells and promote their apoptotic death by numerous mechanisms 96 Inhibit NF\u2010\u03baB 97 Repress transcription of inflammatory pathway genes 98 Promote mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway use 99 NSAIDs Inhibit COX and proinflammatory lipid mediator production 100 At high concentrations, some NSAIDs act as PPAR\u03b3 agonists 101 , 102 IL\u20101 inhibitors Block IL\u20101 activity by blocking IL\u20101 from interacting with its receptor (either by binding to the receptor in place of IL\u20101 [anakinra, a recombinant version of human IL\u20101 receptor antagonist] or by binding to IL\u20101\u03b2, preventing it from then binding to the receptor [canakinumab, a humanized anti\u2013IL\u20101\u03b2 antibody]) 110 Prevents IL\u20101 proinflammatory effects (eg, production of other inflammatory mediators such as IL\u20106 and proinflammatory lipid mediators), reduces signals to promote neutrophilic infiltration 111 * AMPK, AMP\u2010activated protein kinase; COX, cyclooxygenase; IL, interleukin; NET, neutrophil elastase trap; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug; PPAR\u03b3, peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3; ROS, reactive oxygen species. Colchicine inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activity and neutrophil mobilization. 92 , 93 One of the major mechanisms by which it acts is by inhibiting microtubules, which are essential for the transport of NLRP3 components within a cell during inflammasome assembly as well as for cell migration. 93 Colchicine also acts by a wide range of other mechanisms to suppress inflammation, including promoting AMPK activation, 57 inhibiting ROS production by neutrophils, and inhibiting NET formation. 94 , 95 Glucocorticoids have wide\u2010ranging effects, acting by both receptor\u2010dependent and receptor\u2010independent mechanisms to inhibit proliferation, migration, and maturation of immune cells and promote their apoptotic death. 96 The glucocorticoid receptor physically associates with NF\u2010\u03baB, inhibiting its activity, 97 and represses transcription of inflammatory pathway genes. 98 Glucocorticoids also regulate energy metabolism, promoting metabolic rewiring in immune cells such as macrophages in favor of mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway use, and this is also a major contributor to their anti\u2010inflammatory effects. 99 NSAIDs act downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, inhibiting the activity of COX and therefore the production of proinflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandin E 2 . 100 At high concentrations, various NSAIDs also act as PPAR\u03b3 agonists, and this may contribute to some of their anti\u2010inflammatory effects. 101 , 102 Informed by understanding about the central role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of gout flare, IL\u20101 inhibitors have been tested for treatment of gout flare. 93 Two randomized clinical trials of anakinra (a short\u2010acting IL\u20101 receptor antagonist) reported clinical efficacy that was similar to the traditional oral therapies for treatment of gout flare. 103 , 104 In contrast, subcutaneous canakinumab 150 mg, a long\u2010acting human anti\u2013IL\u20101\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, had greater efficacy than intramuscular triamcinolone 40 mg in reducing joint pain, swelling, and tenderness during a gout flare. 105 These findings support the importance of IL\u20101\u03b2 as the key inflammatory mediator of the initiation and maintenance of gout flare. Although NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors have been investigated for gout flare treatment in early\u2010phase development, 106 the clinical efficacy and safety of these agents is not yet established. Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long\u2010term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long\u2010term urate\u2010lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 107 In the first months of initiating urate\u2010lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti\u2010inflammatory medications. 31 Consistent with the central role of IL\u20101\u03b2 in the initiation of acute MSU crystal\u2013induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial. 105 Clinical case follow\u2010up The diagnosis of a gout flare is made, and the patient is prescribed prednisone 40 mg daily for one week. This treatment results in clinical improvement and full resolution of symptoms over 10 days. In view of his recurrent gout flares and clinical evidence of tophus, urate\u2010lowering therapy is recommended, and allopurinol is started at 100 mg daily and gradually increased to 400 mg daily, which reduces the serum urate level to 5.2 mg/dL. Low\u2010dose colchicine (0.6 mg daily) is also prescribed in the first six months of allopurinol treatment to prevent recurrent gout flares. The patient continues to experience mild gout flares over the first year of allopurinol treatment, which are rapidly treated by a home supply of prednisone. After three years of allopurinol treatment, he has been free of gout flares for more than a year, and the nodule on his ear has disappeared. He can exercise regularly and enjoys his 63rd birthday without pain!

    "full_text_abstract": "This review describes the three broad stages of acute inflammation in the context of gout: initiation, leucocyte mobilization, and self\u2010resolution. A typical case of a gout flare is presented. The role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in acute monosodium urate crystal\u2013induced inflammation is reviewed in detail. Treatment strategies for gout are outlined in the context of the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome\u2013mediated acute inflammation."
