  "abstract_text": "<h4>Introduction</h4>In the last 120 years, the field of pediatric urology has seen an exponential growth. In this time, there has not been a comprehensive review of top cited articles within the field.<h4>Objectives</h4>We aim to identify and categorize the top 100 most cited peer-reviewed articles in pediatric urology using citation analysis.<h4>Study design</h4>We searched for articles in the Web of Science™ Core Collection between 1900 and 2020 using terms specific to pediatric urology. We identified relevant pediatric urology articles and selected the top 100 most cited articles. We analysed trends over time for topics and categories and we evaluated the relatedness of these articles using citation analysis software.<h4>Results</h4>The top 100 most cited articles in pediatric urology were published between 1958 and 2016 in 26 countries, across 181 institutions, and in 46 journals. The median number of citations per article was 268 (IQR 225.75-394.25). Clinical manuscripts were the most common among the top 100 cited articles (n = 64) and the most common topic was genital conditions (e.g., penile, inguinal, or testis but not including hypospadias) (n = 19; 16.5%; total citations = 6591). When using bibliometric software to analyse relatedness among the top 100 articles based on citation of one another, we identified 11 clusters of 3 or more articles which corresponded to topics like those we defined a priori (Summary Figure). We found that a greater proportion of articles describing surgical techniques were published prior to 1987 (n = 6, 38%) as compared to after 1987 (n = 11, 13%), while the proportion of basic science articles has increased.<h4>Discussion</h4>This is the first study to analyse the most cited articles in pediatric urology. There was a lower median citation per article and fewer prospective studies in this list compared to other urologic sub-specialties. Similar to other clinical specialties, the focus has moved from describing and comparing operative techniques to exploring mechanisms of disease. This study is limited by using a single parameter (citation rate) and a single citation database.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The list of top 100 most cited articles in pediatric urology is an important resource for clinicians and trainees to understand the body of knowledge and trajectory of this field. It charts the evolution of the field and highlights areas of potential investigation. This objective approach to literature review can facilitate future research and education efforts.",
