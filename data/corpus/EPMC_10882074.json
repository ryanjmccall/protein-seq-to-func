    "abstract_text": "FUSE-binding protein (FBP) binds the single-stranded far upstream element of active c-myc genes, possesses potent transcription activation and repression domains, and is necessary for c-myc expression. A novel 60 kDa protein, the FBP interacting repressor (FIR), blocked activator-dependent, but not basal, transcription through TFIIH. Recruited through FBP's nucleic acid-binding domain, FIR formed a ternary complex with FBP and FUSE. FIR repressed a c-myc reporter via the FUSE. The amino terminus of FIR contained an activator-selective repression domain capable of acting in cis or even in trans in vivo and in vitro. The repression domain of FIR targeted only TFIIH's p89/XPB helicase, required at several stages in transcription, but not factors required for promoter selection. Thus, FIR locks TFIIH in an activation-resistant configuration that still supports basal transcription.",
