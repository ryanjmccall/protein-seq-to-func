  "abstract_text": "hSnm1B is member of the SNM family of exonucleases involved in DNA processing and is known to be localized to telomeres via binding to the telomere-binding protein TRF2. Here we demonstrate that the C terminus of hSnm1B facilitates the concentration of hSnm1B on telomeres by promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of hSnm1B that is not localized to telomeres, as well as by blocking protein degradation and fostering localization to telomeres via binding of TRF2. Finally, a mutant of hSnm1B stabilized independently of exogenous TRF2-induced cell death. Taken together, we speculate that sequestering hSnm1B at telomeres by a combination of stabilizing the protein when bound to telomeres and degrading it when not bound to telomeres may be a means to prevent potentially lethal effects of unregulated hSnm1B activity.",
