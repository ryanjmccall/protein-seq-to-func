    "abstract_text": "Steroid hormone administration causes behavior changes in many and psychosis in a few. The clinical features suggest that genetic variants of the glucocorticoid receptor or cofactors could produce susceptible subpopulations who react adversely to hormonal cascades. To investigate this possibility, coding and splice site sequences of the glucocorticoid receptor were scanned for single nucleotide polymorphisms in genomic DNA samples from 100 schizophrenics (86 Caucasians and 14 African-Americans) and 40 Caucasians with puerperal psychosis. Five amino acid substitutions were found in the amino-terminal domain at frequencies of 0.6 to 3.8% in Caucasians: R23K, F29L, L112F, D233N, and N363S. In addition, four silent nucleotide changes were found: E22E, K293K, D677D, and N766N; a transversion in intron 4 occurred beyond the splice junction. None of these variants can be linked to these disorders at present. However, the N363S variant contributes a new potential phosphorylation site and has been associated with increased body mass and reduced bone mineral density [Huizenga et al., 1998], so it is possible that the other missense variants confer traits that currently are unrecognized. Comparisons to natural glucocorticoid receptor mutants in the familial glucocorticoid resistance syndrome and steroid resistant leukemias suggest that amino acid substitutions at highly conserved residues may cause severe functional defects and serious illness, while changes at less conserved sites produce lesser alterations and milder disease.",
