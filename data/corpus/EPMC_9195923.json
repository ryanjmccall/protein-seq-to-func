    "abstract_text": "Steroid receptors are recovered from hormone-free cells in multiprotein complexes containing hsp90, p23, an immunophilin, and often some hsp70. The immunophilin, which can be of the FK506- or cyclosporin A-binding class, binds to hsp90 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and different receptor heterocomplexes exist depending upon which immunophilin occupies the TPR-binding region of hsp90. We have recently reported that a protein serine/threonine phosphatase that is designated PP5 and contains four TPRs binds to hsp90 and is co-purified with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Chen, M.-S., Silverstein, A. M., Pratt, W. B., and Chinkers, M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 32315-32320). In this work, we show that PP5 is recovered with both GR that is nuclear and GR that is cytoplasmic in hormone-free cells. Approximately one-half of the GR.hsp90 heterocomplexes in L cell cytosol contains an immunophilin with high affinity FK506 binding activity, such as FKBP51 or FKBP52, and approximately 35% contains PP5. Only a small (but undetermined) fraction of the native GR.hsp90 heterocomplexes contain the cyclosporin A-binding immunophilin CyP-40. PP5, FKBP52, and CyP-40 exist in separate heterocomplexes with hsp90, and competition binding experiments with the PP5 TPR domain suggest that the three proteins occupy a common binding site on hsp90. A 55-residue connecting region between the N-terminal TPR domain of human PP5 and its C-terminal phosphatase domain has 50% amino acid homology and 22% identity with the central portion of the peptidylprolyl isomerase domain of human FKBP52. Of the 9 residues in this portion of FKBP52 involved in high affinity interactions with FK506, 3 residues are retained and 4 have homologous substitutions in PP5. Although immunoadsorbed PP5 did not bind [3H]FK506, we found that both rabbit PP5 in reticulocyte lysate and purified rat PP5 were specifically retained by an FK506 affinity matrix. Thus, we propose that PP5 possesses properties of an immunophilin with low affinity FK506 binding activity and that it determines a major portion of the native GR heterocomplexes in L cell cytosol.",
