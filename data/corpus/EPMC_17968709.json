  "abstract_text": "Recent studies using animal models have demonstrated an important role for FAK in the cardiovascular system. In particular, FAK is essential for angiogenesis in the embryo, functions in heart development and modulates the response of cardiomyocytes to pressure overload in adult mice. FAK function at the cellular level is discussed to provide insight into the mechanisms regulating these biological events and the role of FAK in controlling endothelial junctions and responses to mechanical stimulation are discussed.",
