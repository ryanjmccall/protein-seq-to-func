    "abstract_text": "The co-ordinate sequencing of the human neuronal and neuroendocrine marker protein PGP 9.5 and its cDNA is described. The cDNA encodes the complete protein (212 amino acids), and the 340 nucleotide 3'-noncoding region including the polyadenylation signal, indicating an mRNA slightly larger than 1 kb in size. Protein sequencing of 50% of PGP 9.5 confirms the deduced protein sequence.",
