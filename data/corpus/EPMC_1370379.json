  "abstract_text": "Human cDNA clones encoding Pit-1/GHF-1, a pituitary-specific DNA binding factor, were obtained by PCR following reverse transcription of human pituitary RNA. It is approx. 1.3 kb in size with 0.1 kb 5' non-coding region, 0.9 kb protein-coding region and 0.3 kb 3' non-coding region. The predicted human Pit-1/GHF-1 peptide structure has 291 amino acids and is highly conserved among mouse, rat and bovine. In addition, the 5' non-coding region is highly conserved with rat pit-1/GHF-1 sequence to the transcription start site.",
