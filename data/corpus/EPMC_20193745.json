  "abstract_text": "Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), also referred to as breast tumor kinase BRK, is a member of a distinct family of kinases that is evolutionarily related to the SRC family of tyrosine kinases. While not expressed in the normal mammary gland, PTK6 expression is detected in a large proportion of human mammary gland tumors. In breast tumor cells, PTK6 promotes growth factor signaling and cell migration. PTK6 expression is also increased in a number of other epithelial tumors, including ovarian and colon cancer. In contrast, PTK6 is expressed in diverse normal epithelia, including the linings of the gastrointestinal tract, skin and prostate, where its expression correlates with cell cycle exit and differentiation. Disruption of the mouse Ptk6 gene leads to increased growth and impaired differentiation in the small intestine that is accompanied by increased AKT and Wnt signaling. Following total body irradiation, PTK6 expression is induced in proliferating progenitor cells of the intestine, where it plays an essential role in DNA-damage induced apoptosis. A distinguishing feature of PTK6 is its flexibility in intracellular localization, due to a lack of amino-terminal myristoylation/palmitoylation. Recently a number of substrates of PTK6 have been identified, including nuclear RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors. We discuss PTK6 signaling, its apparent conflicting roles in cancer and normal epithelia, and its potential as a therapeutic target in epithelial cancers.",
