TGEV infection mainly causes acute enteric disease characterized by lethal watery diarrhea, severe dehydration, and high mortality in suckling piglets less than 3 weeks old, which has led to severe economic losses in the global swine industry since the first outbreak in 1933 in Ilinois, USA ( 1 , 2 ). TGEV contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of about 28.5 kb ( 3 ), including at least nine open reading frames (ORFs). Two slightly overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, located at the 5' two-thirds of the viral genome, encode a replicase complex that is proteolytically processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to 16) ( 4 ). Structural proteins, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, a small envelope (E) glycoprotein, and accessory proteins 3a, 3b, and 7 are encoded by genes located at the 3\u2032 end ( 5 ). As early as 1981, the presence of high levels of type I interferon (IFN-I) activity in the digestive tract of TGEV-infected newborn piglets was first observed ( 6 ). Thereafter, Charley et al. reported that TGEV infection in human or bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells also induced high IFN-\u03b1 production ( 7 ). Subsequently, Bosworth et al. demonstrated that 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), a well-known IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), was increased in TGEV-infected pigs ( 8 ). Our previous quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that TGEV infection induced canonical IFN-I signaling through Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of the transcription 1 (JAK-STAT1) pathway, and eight tested ISGs, including IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), IFIT2, IFIT3, OAS1, OAS2, Mx1, Mx2, and ISG15 were upregulated after TGEV infection ( 9 ). These early results indicated that TGEV infection activated the IFN-I pathway in vitro and in vivo . However, the underlying mechanism(s) utilized by TGEV to induce IFN-I, and especially which viral protein(s) contribute to it, remain largely unclear. The IFN-I response is a well-known innate immune reaction that occurs in response to virus infection and considered as an important bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) are two critical transcription factors for the regulation of IFN-I production. Secreted IFN-I then stimulates the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway to induce the expression of numerous ISGs, which collaborate to regulate the replication of virus ( 10 ). Many viruses antagonize IFN responses to benefit their propagation, and some viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( 11 ), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) ( 12 ), influenza A virus (IAV) ( 13 ), encephalomyocarditis virus ( 14 ), Reovirus ( 15 ), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) ( 16 ), respiratory syncytial virus ( 17 ), Newcastle disease virus ( 18 ), and Sendai virus (SEV) ( 19 ) initiate innate immune responses. Different viruses employ different mechanisms to regulate innate immune responses. For example, HSV2 induces IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production through toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI), and IFN-inducible 16 ( 16 ). For IAV infection, at least TLR3, TLR7, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) are responsible for the detection of IAV and subsequent innate immune responses ( 13 ). Elucidating the mechanisms through which viruses regulate innate immune responses will help us understand the interactions between virus and host. This study sought to identify TGEV-encoded protein(s) involved in the induction of IFN-\u03b2 production. Our results revealed that TGEV nsp14 was the best inducer of the IFN-\u03b2 pathway among the TGEV-encoded proteins. Mechanistically, nsp14 activates NF-\u03baB but not IRF3, and it interacts with RNA helicase DDX1, which in turn activates IFN-\u03b2 production. Materials and Methods Cells, Viruses, and Antibodies Porcine kidney (PK-15) cells and HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator with 37\u00b0C/5% CO 2 .

Dual luciferase assays were conducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Promega, USA). For each transfection, 0.1 \u00b5g of the indicated reporter plasmid along with 0.02 \u00b5g of pRL-TK for normalization and 0.2\u20130.8 \u00b5g of various expression plasmids or empty control plasmid were used. Cell extracts were collected at the indicated time points and luciferase activity was measured with a dual-specific luciferase assay kit (Promega). All reporter assays were independently repeated at least three times. Co-Immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) and Western Blot Assay Cells in 6-well plates were harvested by the addition of 150 \u00b5l of lysis buffer (4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 3% dithiothreitol, 0.065 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 6.8], 30% glycerine). Equal amounts of samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Expression of \u03b2-actin was detected to demonstrate equal protein sample loading. For CO-IP experiments, HEK-293T cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in 1 ml lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 20 nM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride], and protein concentration was measured and adjusted. For each immunoprecipitation, 500 \u00b5g of cell lysate protein was incubated with 2 \u00b5g of indicated antibody and 25 \u00b5l of protein A/G-agarose (Beyotime) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After three washes with 1 ml lysis buffer, precipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed with immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibodies.

The cells were subsequently stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Beyotime) for 15 min. After washing with PBS, fluorescent images were obtained using an Olympus FV10 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan).

Results TGEV Infection Stimulates IFN-\u03b2 Production in PK-15 Cells Previous studies demonstrated that TGEV infection potently induced IFN-\u03b1 ( 6 , 21 , 22 ), as well as IFN-\u03b2 in IPEC-J2 and swine testicular (ST) cells ( 23 \u2013 25 ). However, whether TGEV infection induces IFN-\u03b2 in PK-15 cells remains unknown. To explore the effect of TGEV on IFN-\u03b2, dual luciferase assays were performed. PK-15 cells were transfected with IFN-\u03b2-Luc and pRL-TK. After 12 h, cells were mock infected or infected with TGEV strain WH-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02, 0.1, or 0.5. As shown in Figure 1 A, TGEV infection significantly induced the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression levels were upregulated in TGEV-infected cells dose-dependently, which further confirmed IFN-\u03b2 production by TGEV infection (Figure 1 B). Figure 1 Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) dose-dependently triggers activation of the IFN-\u03b2 signal pathway and suppresses the replication of VSV. PK-15 cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK and IFN-\u03b2-Luc (A) , IRF3-Luc (C) , or NF-\u03baB-Luc (D) , followed by infection with increasing doses of TGEV [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.02, 0.1, or 0.5] at 12 h post-transfection. The cells lysates were collected for dual luciferase assays at 24 hpi. (B) PK-15 cells were infected with TGEV as described in panel A and harvested at 24 hpi. Cell RNAs were extracted for RT-qPCR to examine the mRNA expression levels of IFN-\u03b2. The mRNA expression levels were normalized to porcine GAPDH transcripts. Values are the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent tests. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, or *** P < 0.001 compared with the mock infection group. (E) PK-15 cells were infected or mock infected with TGEV (MOI = 0.02, 0.1, 0.5). The supernatants were collected for UV-irradiation and then transferred onto fresh PK-15 cells, followed by infection with vesicular stomatitis virus expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP) at 24 h later. Cells were observed with fluorescence microscope at 16 hpi. The supernatants from SEV-treated cells served as a positive control. The induction of IFN-I is reliant on the co-regulation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. To investigate the potential mechanism(s) involved in the IFN-\u03b2 production by TGEV infection, the effect of TGEV on IRF3 and NF-\u03baB promoters were also tested. As displayed in Figures 1 C,D, TGEV infection also upregulated IRF3 and NF-\u03baB promoter activity dose-dependently, indicating that IRF3 and NF-\u03baB are involved in the IFN-\u03b2 production by TGEV infection. Because of the high sensitivity of VSV-GFP to IFN, VSV-GFP expression is commonly monitored for IFN detection. To further evaluate the IFN-\u03b2 response in TGEV-infected cells, a VSV-GFP-based IFN detection assay was performed. PK-15 cells were infected or mock infected with SEV or TGEV (MOI = 0.02, 0.1, 0.5). Then, cell supernatants were collected, UV-irradiated, and then transferred onto fresh PK-15 cells. After 24 h, cells were infected with VSV-GFP and observed under a fluorescence microscope at 16 hpi. As a positive control, supernatants collected from SEV-treated cells suppressed VSV-GFP replication prominently compared with the negative control group (mock). In accordance with the results of dual luciferase assays described above, TGEV infection limited the replication of VSV-GFP in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1 E). These results suggested that TGEV infection increased IFN-\u03b2 production. TGEV nsp14 Induces IFN-\u03b2 Activation Transmissible gastroenteritis virus encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16), four structural proteins (N, M, S, E), and three accessory proteins (ORF7, ORF3a, ORF3b). To identify the key viral protein(s) involved in IFN-\u03b2 induction, an IFN promoter-reporter system was employed to screen TGEV-encoded proteins for their relative capacities to activate the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with IFN-\u03b2-Luc, pRL-TK, and different TGEV protein expression vectors. As shown in Figure 2 A, nsp14 was the most significant inducer of IFN-\u03b2 production. Furthermore, similar to SARS-(coronavirus) CoV ( 26 ), TGEV M glycoprotein also potently mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. Because NF-\u03baB and IRF3 are necessary transcription factors for IFN-\u03b2 production, we examined the effects of all TGEV-encoded proteins on IRF3 and NF-\u03baB promoter activity. Interestingly, nsp14 upregulated an approximately 8.8-fold change in NF-\u03baB promoter activity, but only an approximately 1.8-fold change in IRF3 promoter activity (Figures 2 C,E). M glycoprotein induced a higher fold change in IRF3, but a lower fold change in NF-\u03baB compared with nsp14. Because M glycoprotein has been investigated previously ( 27 ), we focused on nsp14. Figure 2 Effect of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) proteins on IFN-\u03b2, IRF3, and NF-\u03baB promoter. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK and IFN-\u03b2-Luc (A) , IRF3-Luc (C) , or NF-\u03baB-Luc (E) together with each expression plasmid of TGEV proteins. Also, PK-15 cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK and IFN-\u03b2-Luc (B) , IRF3-Luc (D) , or NF-\u03baB-Luc (F) together with each expression plasmid of TGEV proteins. The cell lysates were harvested for dual luciferase assays at 30 h post-transfection. Values are the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent tests. *** P < 0.001 or ** P < 0.01 compared with empty vector group. To confirm the ability of nsp14 to induce IFN-\u03b2 production, large-scale screen experiment was also conducted in PK-15 cells, a permissive cell line of TGEV infection. As shown in Figures 2 B,D,F, nsp14 was also a potent IFN inducer that mainly induced activation of NF-\u03baB but not IRF3 promoter in PK-15 cells. Nsp14 Induces Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation of p65 To confirm the above large-scale screen results, increasing doses (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 \u00b5g) of pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 and IFN-\u03b2-Luc, IRF3-Luc or NF-\u03baB-Luc together with pRL-TK were cotransfected into HEK-293T cells. In line with the results in Figure 2 , nsp14 enhanced the activation of IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 3 A\u2013C). Interestingly, nsp14 induced the activation of NF-\u03baB to a greater extent than that of IRF3, indicating NF-\u03baB has a fundamental role in nsp14-induced IFN-\u03b2 activation. Similar results were also obtained in PK-15 cells (Figures 3 D\u2013F). Figure 3 Transmissible gastroenteritis virus nsp14 triggers IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB activation. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK plasmid and IFN-\u03b2-Luc (A) , IRF3-Luc (B) , or NF-\u03baB-Luc (C) luciferase reporter plasmids together with increasing doses (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 \u00b5g) of pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector. Also, PK-15 cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK plasmid and IFN-\u03b2-Luc (D) , IRF3-Luc (E) , or NF-\u03baB-Luc (F) luciferase reporter plasmids together with increasing doses (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 \u00b5g) of pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector. The cells lysates were harvested for dual luciferase assays at 30 h post-transfection. Values are the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent tests. ** P < 0.01 or *** P < 0.001 compared with empty vector group. (G) HEK-293T cells were transfected with increasing quantities (1, 2, 4 \u00b5g) of pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector for 30 h, and then subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies specific for endogenous IRF3, phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3), p65, or p-p65. Anti-HA mouse antibody was used to confirm the expression of nsp14. \u03b2-actin expression was used as a loading control. The ratio of phosphorylated/total p65 and phosphorylated/total IRF3 was analyzed using ImageJ Software. (H) PK-15 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged nsp14 protein or empty vector together with plasmids encoding EGFP-tagged p65 protein. Then, the cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to observe the nuclear translocation of overexpressed p65 using confocal microscopy. (I) HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged nsp14 protein or empty vector. Then, the cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-p65 antibody to observe the nuclear translocation of endogenous p65 using confocal microscopy. NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation are characterized by the phosphorylation and subsequent translocation of p65 (NF-\u03baB subunit) or IRF3 to the nucleus, respectively ( 28 \u2013 30 ). Next, we investigated the role of nsp14 in the phosphorylation of p65 and IRF3. HEK-293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of pCAGGS-HA-nsp14, and cell lysates were examined for the expression levels of p-p65 or p-IRF3 and total p65 or IRF3 at 30 h post-transfection. As shown in Figure 3 G, nsp14 overexpression had no significant effect on the amount of p65, IRF3, and p-IRF3; however, markedly increased p65 phosphorylation levels, indicating the activation of NF-\u03baB, rather than IRF3 is associated with nsp14-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Therefore, the subcellular location of p65 was further investigated after nsp14 overexpression. As shown in Figures 3 H,I, ectopic expression of nsp14 resulted in the nuclear translocation of overexpressed p65 in PK-15 cells (Figure 3 H) and endogenous p65 in HEK-293T cells (Figure 3 I). Nsp14 Interacts with DDX1 Early studies suggested that nsp14 of CoV IBV and SARS-CoV interacts with host protein DDX1 ( 31 ). Therefore, we investigated whether TGEV nsp14 also interacts with DDX1 by CO-IP. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 and pCMV-Tag2B-DDX1. Because DDX1 is a DExD/H-box helicase and is associated with RNA metabolism, the lysates were treated with RNase to avoid the effect of RNA on the CO-IP experiment. As shown in Figure 4 A, Flag-tagged DDX1 was coprecipitated by HA-tagged nsp14, indicating the interaction between nsp14 and DDX1. Reversed IP with Flag antibody further confirmed this interaction (Figure 4 B). Figure 4 Interaction between transmissible gastroenteritis virus nsp14 and DDX1. (A,B) HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 and/or pCMV-Tag2B-DDX1 and/or empty vector(s). Cell lysates were treated with RNase and co-immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (A) or anti-Flag (B) mAbs followed by immunoblot of nsp14 and DDX1 using anti-HA and -Flag mAbs to assess the interaction between nsp14 and DDX1 protein. (C) Colocalization of DDX1 with nsp14. PK-15 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector. Then, the cells were fixed at 30 h post-transfection and immunostained with anti-HA mouse antibody and anti-DDX1 rabbit antibody to detect the colocalization of DDX1 with nsp14. To test whether the colocalization of nsp14 and DDX1 occurs, a prerequisite for the interaction, PK-15 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector and fixed at 30 h post-transfection. HA-tagged nsp14 protein was detected with mouse anti-HA antibody, and DDX1 was detected with rabbit anti-DDX1 antibody. The results revealed that nsp14 was colocalized with DDX1 and distributed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 4 C), which further confirmed the interaction between TGEV nsp14 and DDX1. DDX1 Is Involved in nsp14-Induced IFN-\u03b2 Production Because nsp14 activates IFN-\u03b2 and interacts with DDX1, we investigated whether DDX1 is involved in nsp14-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Synthesized siRNA targeting human DDX1 (hsiDDX1), which efficiently decreases the expression of endogenous DDX1 mRNA (Figure 5 A) and protein (Figure 5 B), was selected. Next, HEK-293T cells were transfected with hsiDDX1 or siNC, followed by co-transfection of IFN-\u03b2-luc or NF-\u03baB-Luc, pRL-TK, along with pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector. The results revealed that knockdown of DDX1 significantly decreased nsp14-induced promoter activity of IFN-\u03b2 (Figure 5 C) and NF-\u03baB (Figure 5 D). Moreover, mRNA expression levels of nsp14-induced IFN-\u03b2 were downregulated by DDX1 deficiency (Figure 5 E), suggesting the involvement of DDX1 in IFN-\u03b2 induction by nsp14. Figure 5 Silencing DDX1 decreases nsp14-stimulated IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB activation. (A,B) Assessment of the silencing efficiency of hsiDDX1. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 50 nM/well of hsiDDX1 or siNC for 36 h each. The expression levels of human DDX1 were determined by RT-qPCR (A) and western blot assay (B) . (C,D) HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with psiDDX1 or siNC, together with pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector, pRL-TK, IFN-\u03b2-Luc (C) , or NF-\u03baB-Luc (D) . Dual luciferase assays were performed at 30 h post-transfection. (E) HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with psiDDX1 or siNC, together with pCAGGS-HA-nsp14 or empty vector and harvested at 30 h post-transfection. Cell RNAs were extracted for RT-qPCR to examine the mRNA expression levels of IFN-\u03b2. The mRNA expression levels were normalized to human GAPDH transcripts. All data represent the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. * P < 0.05 or *** P < 0.001 compared with the siNC group. DDX1 Is Involved in TGEV-Induced IFN-\u03b2 Activation and ISG Expression To determine whether DDX1 is involved in TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 activation, we designed three pairs of siRNAs targeting porcine DDX1 (psiDDX1) and selected one with the best knockdown efficiency as demonstrated by RT-qPCR (Figure 6 A) and western blot assay (Figure 6 B), for subsequent experiments. PK-15 cells were cotransfected with IFN-\u03b2-Luc or NF-\u03baB-luc, pRL-TK, together with psiDDX1 or siNC. At 12 h post-transfection, cells were infected with TGEV for 24 h, followed by dual luciferase assay. DDX1 depletion had no effect on the basal activity of IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB promoter, but significantly decreased TGEV-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB (Figures 6 C,D). We also detected the expression level of p-p65 in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells when DDX1 was silenced. As shown in Figure 6 E, knockdown of DDX1 reduced TGEV-induced p65 phosphorylation. These results suggested that DDX1 is associated with TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB activation. Figure 6 Involvement of DDX1 in the antiviral response triggered by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). (A,B) Assessment of the silencing efficiency of psiDDX1. PK-15 cells were transfected with 50 nM/well of psiDDX1 or siNC for 36 h each. The expression levels of porcine DDX1 were determined by RT-qPCR (A) and western blot assay (B) . (C,D) PK-15 cells were cotransfected with psiDDX1 or siNC, along with pRL-TK, IFN-\u03b2-Luc (C) , or NF-\u03baB-Luc (D) . At 12 h post-transfection, cells were mock infected or infected with TGEV [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.5]. Dual luciferase assays were performed at 24 hpi. (E) PK-15 cells were transfected with psiDDX1 or siNC, and 12 h later, cells were mock infected or infected with TGEV (MOI = 0.5) for 24 h. Then, the cells were collected for western blot assay with specific antibodies against p65, p-p65, DDX1, or TGEV N protein, using \u03b2-actin expression as a loading control. The ratio of phosphorylated/total p65 was analyzed using ImageJ Software. (F\u2013J) PK-15 cells were treated as described for (E) and collected at 24 hpi. Cell RNAs were extracted for RT-qPCR to examine the mRNA expression levels of IFIT1 (F) , IFIT2 (G) , IFIT3 (H) , IL-6 (I) , and IL-8 (J) . The mRNA expression levels were normalized to porcine GAPDH transcripts. Values are the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent tests. * P < 0.05 or ** P < 0.01 compared with the siNC group. Interferon-I initiates a series of signaling cascades through the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in the expression of numerous ISGs ( 32 ). Furthermore, NF-\u03baB activation plays a pivotal role in regulating the transcription and expression of many proinflammatory cytokines. Because DDX1 is involved in TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB activation, theoretically, it should have an impact on TGEV-induced ISG and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. The expression levels of some ISGs (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) in DDX1-knockdown cells were analyzed after TGEV infection. As expected, DDX1 depletion inhibited the expression of IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, as well as IL-6 and IL-8 to some degree, compared with that in cells transfected with siNC (Figures 6 F\u2013J). Discussion The innate immune response characterized by the synthesis of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines is the first line of antiviral defense. Multiple studies have reported the involvement of CoVs in the regulation of innate immune responses. The majority of CoVs decreased dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) ( 33 ), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ( 34 ), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) ( 35 ). Interestingly, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and established an antiviral state in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages, but failed to produce IFN in neurons, astrocytes, and hepatocytes ( 36 , 37 ), indicating that MHV induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is cell type dependent. A previous study showed that TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b1 secretion in vitro and in vivo ( 38 ). Here, we found that TGEV infection increased the production of IFN-\u03b2 in a dose-dependent manner in PK-15 cells, in line with previously reported data ( 25 ). The significant roles of many CoV proteins in the regulation of innate immune response have been identified. For example, nsp1, nsp7, nsp15, Papain-like protease (PLpro), ORF3b, ORF6, ORF9b, and N protein of SARS-CoV have been identified as IFN antagonists via various mechanisms ( 39 ). PEDV-encoded PLpro, N protein, and 3C-like protease nsp5 inhibit IFN production ( 40 ). The current study used an IFN-\u03b2 promoter-reporter system and found that several TGEV-encoded proteins, particularly nsp14 and M glycoprotein, induced the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 and/or NF-\u03baB pathway, which also regulate the IFN-I response mediated by other CoVs. Lui et al. reported that the MERS-CoV M glycoprotein is an IFN antagonist because it specifically inhibited IRF3 activation but not NF-\u03baB signaling ( 41 ). Conversely, our data revealed that the TGEV M glycoprotein was a potential IFN inducer that mainly facilitated IRF3 activation but not NF-\u03baB signaling. Laude et al. also revealed the direct role of M glycoprotein in the induction of IFN-\u03b1 by TGEV infection ( 27 ). Similarly, M glycoprotein is vital to the induction of IFN by MHV infection in LMR cells ( 42 ). However, the effects of SARS-CoV M glycoprotein on IFN-I responses are controversial. Wang et al. reported that the SARS-CoV M glycoprotein induced IFN-I production via a toll-like receptor-related TRAF3-independent mechanism ( 26 ). In contrast, other researchers reported the opposite conclusion that the SARS-CoV M glycoprotein suppressed NF-\u03baB activation ( 43 ) and inhibited IFN-I production by preventing formation of the TRAF3\u2013TANK\u2013TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex ( 44 ). Wang et al. suggested that these discrepancies may be attributed to the amino acid substitution in the M glycoproteins of different SARS-CoV strains ( 45 ). Interestingly, Becares et al. found that rTGEV-zinc finger 1 (ZF-C) (a recombinant TGEV engineered mutation within ZF-C domain of nsp14) infection resulted in the significant inhibition of antiviral responses at different stages compared with rTGEV-WT infection, including the expression of IFN-\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor, and ISGs ( 25 ). This indicated the potential effect of TGEV nsp14 on IFN-\u03b2 induction, which is in line with our data and further confirms our conclusion using a reverse genetic system. Although nsp14 was identified as a key IFN-\u03b2 activator among TGEV-encoded proteins, it remains unclear which PRR(s) is involved in its detection and induction of IFN-\u03b2 production. Indeed, viral proteins, similar to viral nucleic acids or replication intermediates, can in some cases also function as PAMPs, specifically recognized by certain host PRRs, such as TLR2 and TLR4, to modulate the IFN responses during viral infection ( 46 , 47 ). For example, the M glycoprotein of SARS-CoV has been reported to function as a novel cytosolic PAMP to promote IFN-\u03b2 production by activating a non-canonical TLR signaling cascade ( 26 ). In addition to the four major PRR groups reported previously, including TLRs, RIG-I-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and cytoplasmic DNA receptors ( 48 ), multiple DExD/H-box helicases, such as DDX1, DDX3, DDX9, and DDX41, were reported recently to act as PRRs and sense viral PAMPs to activate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and induce IFN-\u03b2 production ( 49 \u2013 53 ). Previous study revealed that DDX1, DDX21, and DHX36 form a complex with the adaptor molecule TRIF to sense dsRNA in dendritic cells ( 53 ). In this paper, DDX1 interacted with TGEV nsp14 in a RNA-independent manner and enhanced both TGEV- and nsp14-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 responses. However, the direct interactions between nsp14 and DDX21 or DHX36 were not observed. We speculated that nsp14 may be sensed by DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 complex by interacting with DDX1. These results suggest that nsp14 may be recognized as PAMP by DDX1, which triggers an antiviral response. Further studies are required to investigate this in more detail. DDX1 is a DExD/H helicase family member composed of the DEAD-box and related DEAH, DexH, and DexD protein family and is involved in multiple cellular processes of RNA metabolism ( 54 , 55 ). Besides these traditional roles, it appears that multiple proteins of the DexD/H-box helicase family are associated with viral components and/or have alternative effects on viral propagation ( 56 \u2013 58 ). For instance, DDX3 shows antiviral functions against vaccinia virus, DENV, and HBV ( 59 \u2013 61 ), but is of benefit for HCV and HIV infection ( 62 , 63 ). In addition, DDX1 interacts with the nsp3 of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and enhances viral multiplication ( 64 ). The interaction of DDX1 with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein is involved in the regulation of virus replication ( 65 ). In the present study, the knockdown and ectopic expression of DDX1 demonstrated that DDX1 had antiviral activity against TGEV replication (data not shown). Interestingly, earlier studies also showed an interaction between DDX1 with coronavirus (IBV and SARS-CoV) nsp14, and in contrast to TGEV, this interaction might enhance the replication of IBV ( 31 ). This difference suggests that DDX1 is not likely to be a general target against CoV infection. Furthermore, it should be noted that the effect of DDX1 on progeny TGEV production was moderate (data not shown). Difference from other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which antagonize IFN-I, TGEV infection induces IFN-I production, and a most recent paper showed that poly(I:C)-induced IFN-I responses could only inhibit TGEV replication in the early infection stage, but failed in the late infection stage ( 23 ). They also demonstrated that the activation of IFN-I responses by TGEV infection cannot inhibit viral replication. Our results are consistent with the conclusion proposed by Zhu and colleagues. In addition, it is surprising that the expression levels of IFN-\u03b2 are paralleled with the increase of viral RNA during TGEV infection. These may explain why the effect of DDX1 on TGEV replication was moderate accompany with its significant role in IFN-\u03b2 induction by TGEV. However, more studies are required to investigate the complex interaction between TGEV and IFNs. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that TGEV infection induces IFN-\u03b2 production and nsp14 is the most significant IFN-\u03b2 inducer among the TGEV-encoded proteins. Nsp14 interacts with cellular DExD/H helicase DDX1 to activate IFN-\u03b2 in a NF-\u03baB dependent manner, and DDX1 is associated with TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, revealing a potential coactivator role of host RNA helicase DDX1 on virus and viral protein induced innate immune responses.

    "full_text_abstract": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV) of porcine, causes lethal watery diarrhea and severe dehydration in piglets and leads to severe economic losses in the swine industry. Unlike most CoVs that antagonize type I interferon (IFN) production, previous studies showed that TGEV infection induces IFN-I production both in vivo and in vitro . However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that TGEV infection significantly facilitated IFN-\u03b2 production as well as activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Screening of TGEV-encoded proteins demonstrated that non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) was the most potent IFN-\u03b2 inducer and induced IFN-\u03b2 production mainly by activating NF-\u03baB but not IRF3. Further analysis showed that nsp14 interacted with DDX1, a member of the DExD/H helicase family. Knockdown of DDX1 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased nsp14-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and NF-\u03baB activation. Furthermore, TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were decreased in cells transfected with DDX1-specific siRNA, indicating the vital role of DDX1 to TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 responses. In summary, our data revealed a potential coactivator role of host RNA helicase DDX1 to the induction of IFN-\u03b2 response initiated by TGEV and demonstrated that nsp14 is an important IFN inducer among the TGEV-encoded proteins."
