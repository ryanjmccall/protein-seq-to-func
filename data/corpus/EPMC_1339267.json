    "abstract_text": "The 5'-flanking region of the human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene was isolated from a human placental genomic library using the cDNA fragment for the 5'-noncoding region of human BDNF as a probe. A 3.2 Kbp genomic fragment containing the 5'-flanking region, the first exon and a portion of the first intron was isolated and sequenced. The transcriptional initiation site, identified by S1 nuclease mapping, was located 26 bp downstream from the TATA-like sequence. Several expression plasmids, in which the BDNF promoter regions were fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, were constructed. Transient expression in human glioma Hs683 cells demonstrated that a fragment of about 0.5 Kbp from the transcriptional initiation site was sufficient for promoter activity.",
