    "abstract_text": "Phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating the activation and signalling lifetime of protein kinases A, B (also known as Akt) and C. These kinases share three conserved phosphorylation motifs: the activation loop segment, the turn motif and the hydrophobic motif. This review focuses on how phosphorylation at each of these sites regulates the maturation, signalling and down-regulation of PKC as a paradigm for how these sites control the function of the ABC kinases.",
