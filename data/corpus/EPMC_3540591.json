  "title": "Novel promoter upstream of the human c-myc gene and regulation of c-myc expression in B-cell lymphomas.",

  "abstract_text": "A new promoter of the human c-myc gene called P0, with multiple RNA start sites, was mapped over 500 bases upstream of the two previously identified promoters, P1 and P2. Sequencing full-length cDNA clones of P0 RNAs revealed two open reading frames upstream of that for the P64c-myc protein. P0 RNA is located on polyribosomes and released by puromycin, indicating that it functions as an mRNA. In vitro translation of RNA synthesized from the cloned cDNAs predicts that P0 transcripts are translated into a novel 12.5-kilodalton protein corresponding to the first open reading frame. The regulation of P0 RNA was studied in the B-cell lymphoma cell line Manca, in which only the translocated c-myc allele lacking exon 1 was thought to be active. However, we found that P0 transcription and the DNase I-hypersensitive site associated with this promoter persist on the untranslocated allele, even though P1/P2 transcription as measured by a nuclear runoff assay was repressed. These results suggest that allelic exclusion of c-myc expression in this B-cell lymphoma is caused by a repression of transcription which is specific to the P1/P2 promoters. We previously reported a block to elongation of transcription near the 3' end of exon 1 in the wild-type c-myc gene, which results in an excess of exon 1 over exon 2 transcription (5a). In contrast, we found that in the Daudi B-cell lymphoma, which retains exon 1 in the active allele, equimolar transcription of exons 1 and 2 occurs. This result suggests a model for the activation of c-myc in B-cell lymphomas.",
