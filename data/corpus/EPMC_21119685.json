  "abstract_text": "Notch signaling controls multiple developmental processes, thus demanding versatile functions. We have previously shown that this may be partly achieved by accelerating ubiquitin-mediated degradation of important regulators of differentiation. However, the underlying mechanism was unknown. We now find that Notch signaling transcriptionally activates the gene encoding ankyrin-repeat SOCS box-containing protein 2 (Asb2). Asb2 promotes the ubiquitination of Notch targets such as E2A and Janus kinase (Jak) 2, and a dominant-negative (DN) mutant of Asb2 blocks Notch-induced degradation of these proteins. Asb2 likely binds Jak2 directly but associates with E2A through Skp2. We next provide evidence to suggest that Asb2 bridges the formation of non-canonical cullin-based complexes through interaction with not only ElonginB/C and Cullin (Cul) 5, but also the F-box-containing protein, Skp2, which is known to associate with Skp1 and Cul1. Consistently, ablating the function of Cul1 or Cul5 using DN mutants or siRNAs protected both E2A and Jak2 from Asb2-mediated or Notch-induced degradation. By shifting monomeric E3 ligase complexes to dimeric forms through activation of Asb2 transcription, Notch could effectively control the turnover of a variety of substrates and it exerts diverse effects on cell proliferation and differentiation.",
