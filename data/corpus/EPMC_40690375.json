Modulating the stability and aggregation of p53 isoforms could be a novel strategy for cancer therapy. eLife digest Cancer is a deadly disease that continues to pose a major challenge to global healthcare systems. It arises when some cells acquire mutations that allow them to grow and divide uncontrollably. A key player for preventing this uncontrolled cell growth is the protein p53, which binds to DNA and regulates the activities of genes that determine whether a cell should grow, divide, or die. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 can hinder its ability to regulate gene activity, thereby contributing to cancer. Additionally, shorter versions of p53 \u2013 known as p53 isoforms \u2013 can accumulate in the cell and coexist with the normal full-length protein. These isoforms sometimes lack critical components of the protein, whilst retaining other properties. For example, two p53 isoforms \u2013 called \u2206133p53\u03b1 and \u2206160p53\u03b1 \u2013 are missing parts of the DNA-binding domain but can still bind to full-length p53 protein. Here, Zhao, Punga and Sanyal used biochemical and cell biology approaches to investigate how the \u2206133p53\u03b1 and \u2206160p53\u03b1 isoforms affect the activity of full-length p53. The team found that both isoforms can bind to full-length p53 protein and form tetramers, large molecules made up of four p53 sub-units. In addition, they found that the \u2206133p53\u03b1 and \u2206160p53\u03b1 isoforms can form aggregates with full-length p53. As a result, full-length p53 protein gets sequestered within these aggregates, which prevents them from binding to DNA and carrying out their role in gene expression and cell-death regulation. These findings open up new avenues for cancer research, particularly in cancer patients who have truncated isoforms of the p53 protein. Developing new therapies that prevent shorter and normal full-length p53 protein from forming irregular aggregates may have the potential to prevent, or slow, cancer progression in these patients. p53 cancer apoptosis p53 isoform dominant-negative effect protein aggregation Research organism None http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359 Vetenskapsr\u00e5det 2023-05237 Sanyal Suparna http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359 Vetenskapsr\u00e5det 2018-05946 Sanyal Suparna http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359 Vetenskapsr\u00e5det 2018-05498 Sanyal Suparna http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014437 Wenner-Gren Stiftelserna UPD2023-0185 Sanyal Suparna http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063 Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse KAW 2017.0055 Sanyal Suparna The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication. Author impact statement The N-terminally truncated \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 isoforms exert dominant-negative effects through co-aggregation with p53, disrupting its transcriptional activity and cellular distribution, thereby contributing to cancer development. publishing-route prc Introduction The tumor suppressor protein p53 is an essential transcription activator protein modulating the expression of multiple target genes. By regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and angiogenesis, p53 prevents cancer development ( Levine and Oren, 2009 ; Vogelstein et al., 2000 ). The intricate p53 pathway is stimulated by various stress stimuli, including DNA damage and oncogene activation, which lead to the stabilization and activation of the p53 protein ( Pflaum et al., 2014 ). Stabilized p53 acts as a transcription activator protein as it can directly bind to its response elements (REs) and recruit different transcription co-activator proteins at various gene promoters ( Sullivan et al., 2018 ). One of the best-known p53 targets is the p21 (also known as CIP1, WAF1) gene promoter, which contains two p53REs and is efficiently activated by the p53 protein ( el-Deiry et al., 1993 ; Macleod et al., 1995 ). The encoded p21 protein blocks cell cycle progression and thereby executes tumor suppressor activity of the p53 protein ( Indeglia and Murphy, 2024 ; Shamloo and Usluer, 2019 ). The TP53 gene produces at least 12 distinct p53 isoforms: p53 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), \u039440p53 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), \u0394133p53 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), and \u0394160p53 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). It has been shown that the p53 isoforms contribute to the regulation of the p53 pathway by regulating the expression of p53 target genes ( Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016 ; Khoury and Bourdon, 2011 ; Zhao and Sanyal, 2022 ). Notably, p53 isoforms exhibit both overlapping and distinct functions compared to canonical p53 ( Mehta et al., 2021 ; Pal et al., 2023 ; Zhao and Sanyal, 2022 ) and have been reported to promote tumor progression in various cancers ( Vieler and Sanyal, 2018 ; Zhao and Sanyal, 2022 ). The p53 isoforms are generated through alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, and alternative transcription starting site usage ( Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016 ; Sharathchandra et al., 2014 ). These isoforms differ from the full-length (FL) p53 (canonical p53, p53\u03b1) by lacking variable segments of the N-terminus (N-terminal isoforms: \u039440, \u0394133, and \u0394160) and possessing alternative C-terminus (C-terminal isoforms: \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3). The FLp53 protein consists of four primary functional domains: transactivation domains (TAD-1 and TAD-2), DNA-binding core domain (DBD), nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and the oligomerization domain (OD) ( Khoury and Bourdon, 2010 ). Native FLp53 typically functions as a tetrameric protein, where the individual monomers bind cooperatively to DNA ( Jeffrey et al., 1995 ; Weinberg et al., 2004 ). The C-terminal truncated isoforms (\u03b2/\u03b3 isoforms) lacking the OD have lower transactivation activity because of reduced tetramerization efficiency ( J\u00e4nicke et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 1994 ; Wang et al., 1995 ). In contrast, the N-terminal truncated isoforms (\u03b1 isoforms), which retain the entire C-terminal OD, can form various complexes with FLp53 and exert dominant-negative effects on p53\u2019s transcriptional activity ( Bourdon et al., 2005 ; Fujita et al., 2009 ; Horikawa et al., 2017 ). This study focuses on two large N-terminal deleted p53 isoforms: \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1, the latter has been largely unexplored. For convenience and simplicity, we have written \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 to represent the \u03b1 isoforms (\u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1) throughout this manuscript. The \u0394133p53 protein lacks both TADs and a part of the first conserved cysteine box of the DBD, whereas the \u0394160p53 protein lacks both TADs and the entire first conserved cysteine box of the DBD ( Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016 ; Pavletich et al., 1993 ). The \u0394133p53 isoform exhibits complex biological functions, with both oncogenic and non-oncogenic potentials. Recent studies demonstrate the non-oncogenic yet context-dependent role of the \u0394133p53 isoform in cancer development. \u0394133p53 expression has been reported to correlate with improved survival in patients with TP53 mutations ( Bischof et al., 2019 ; Hofstetter et al., 2011 ), where it promotes cell survival in a non-oncogenic manner ( Gong et al., 2015 ; Gong et al., 2016b ), especially under low oxidative stress ( Gong et al., 2016c ). Alternatively, other recent evidence emphasizes the notable oncogenic functions of \u0394133p53 as it can inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis by directly interacting with the FLp53 ( Aoubala et al., 2011 ; Bourdon et al., 2005 ). The oncogenic function of the newly identified \u0394160p53 isoform is less known, although it is associated with p53 mutation-driven tumorigenesis ( Candeias et al., 2016 ) and in melanoma cells\u2019 aggressiveness ( Tadijan et al., 2021 ). Whether or not the \u0394160p53 isoform also impedes FLp53 function in a similar way as \u0394133p53 is an open question. However, these p53 isoforms can certainly compromise p53-mediated tumor suppression by interfering with FLp53 binding to target genes such as p21 and miR-34a ( Fujita et al., 2009 ; Horikawa et al., 2017 ) by dominant-negative effect, and the exact mechanism is not known. Protein aggregation has become a central focus of modern biology research and has documented implications in various diseases, including cancer ( Farmer et al., 2020 ; Forget et al., 2013 ; Petronilho et al., 2024 ). Protein aggregates can be of different types, ranging from amorphous aggregates to highly structured amyloid or fibrillar aggregates, each with different physiological implications. In the case of p53, whether protein aggregation, and, in particular, co-aggregation with large N-terminal deletion isoforms, plays a mechanistic role in its inactivation is yet underexplored. Interestingly, the \u0394133p53\u03b2 isoform has been shown to aggregate in several human cancer cell lines ( Arsic et al., 2021 ). Additionally, the \u039440p53\u03b1 isoform exhibits a high aggregation tendency in endometrial cancer cells ( Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019 ). Although no direct evidence exists for \u0394160p53 yet, these findings imply that p53 isoform aggregation may play a major role in their mechanisms of actions. The precise molecular mechanisms involved in the biological function of the \u0394133p53 and the \u0394160p53 proteins, especially how they exert dominant-negative effects on FLp53, remain poorly understood. In this study, we have analyzed the DNA-binding, transcriptional activity, and oligomerization capacity of the human FLp53, \u0394133p53, and \u0394160p53 proteins. Our data show that the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins are deficient in binding to p53-regulated promoters and inducing expression of the p53 target genes. Moreover, the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms can form hetero-oligomers with FLp53 and inhibit FLp53 function in a concentration-dependent manner. Two potential mechanisms for their dominant-negative effects have been suggested: (i) the formation of hetero-tetramers with FLp53, inhibiting its DNA-binding and transcriptional activity, and (ii) the aggregation property of the isoforms leading to co-aggregation of the FLp53 protein. Interestingly, while hetero-tetramerization partially attenuates p53 activity, the co-aggregation of FLp53 with \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 emerges as the predominant factor contributing to the dominant-negative effect. Results \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins exhibit structural destabilization, exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, and high propensity to aggregation The DBD, also known as the core domain of the FLp53 protein (human p53, residues 94\u2013292), has a structure with an aggregation-prone sequence (residues 251\u2013257) ( Xu et al., 2011 ; Figure 1A ). The core domain contains a hydrophobic core of \u03b2-sandwich, which consists of two antiparallel \u03b2-sheets with four strands (S1, S3, S8, and S5) and five strands (S6, S7, S4, S9, and S10), respectively ( Cho et al., 1994 ; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ). The DNA-binding surface is constituted by two large loops (L2 and L3) and a loop-sheet-helix (LSH) motif, which comprises loop L1, a \u03b2-sheet formed by the \u03b2-hairpin S2\u2013S2\u2032, the C-terminal residues of strand S10, and the \u03b1-helix H2 ( Joerger et al., 2004 ; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ). Compared to FLp53, the N-terminal deletion isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 lack the entire TADs ( Figure 1A ), which are crucial for recruiting transcription co-activator proteins ( Raj and Attardi, 2017 ). In addition, the \u0394133p53 protein is missing the \u03b2-strand S1 in the \u03b2-sandwich and a part of the LSH motif (L1, S2, and the N-terminal residue 132 of the strand S2\u2032) in the DBD ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ). The \u0394160p53 protein, on the other hand, lacks a part of the \u03b2-sandwich (\u03b2-strands S1, S3, and N-terminal residues 156\u2013159 of S4) and a part of the LSH motif (L1 and \u03b2-hairpin S2\u2013S2\u2032) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ). Therefore, the N-terminal deletion affects the structural integrity of both the \u03b2-sandwich and the LSH motif in the core domain. Figure 1.

The core domain structures of FLp53 (A chain, residues 92\u2013291, PDB ID: 3KMD) and its isoforms \u0394133p53 (residues 133\u2013291, predicted by AlphaFold2) and \u0394160p53 (residues 160\u2013291, predicted by AlphaFold2) ( Mirdita et al., 2022 ). Each structure is presented in the same orientation to facilitate direct comparison. The structures are analyzed by ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 ; Meng et al., 2023 ). Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2. Aggregation propensity of FLp53 and its \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms by sedimentation analysis in SDS-PAGE. Purified protein FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM incubated in 20 \u00b5l of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 5% glycerol) at 4\u00b0C, room temperature (RT) (approximately 23\u00b0C), or 37\u00b0C for 1 hr or 2 hr. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000\u00d7 g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 20 \u00b5l buffer. Both the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. While the FLp53 protein was detected only in the soluble supernatant fraction irrespective of temperature, a significant amount of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins was detected in the insoluble pellet fraction. This result suggests that the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms are inherently destabilized and have much higher aggregation propensity than FLp53. FLp53 protein was sourced from Sigma (catalog number P6247), while \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins were purified in our lab using multiple column chromatography.

Original SDS-PAGE gel images corresponding to Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 . To assess the structural impact of the N-terminal deletions in FLp53, we analyzed the contact information derived from the core domain of FLp53 (PDB ID: 3KMD) structure ( Chen et al., 2010 ). We observed that both \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 lack several crucial contacts between the N- and C-terminal regions in FLp53 ( Figure 1B ). For \u0394133p53, the contact between the L1 and S2 segments in the N-terminal region and the \u03b1-helix H2 in the C-terminal region within the LSH motif is disrupted ( Figure 1B , insert 1), suggesting a potential impairment of the stability of DNA-binding interface. For \u0394160p53, in addition to the missing contact between L1, S2, and H2, there are also no contacts between the S2\u2032 segment in the N-terminal region and the S10 and H2 segments in the C-terminal region within the LSH motif ( Figure 1B , insert 2), as well as between S4 and S7 or S9 in the \u03b2-sandwich core domain ( Figure 1B , inserts 3 and 4). These contacts are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and folding of the core domain. Therefore, both \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 will likely have a partially or fully destabilized core domain that may impair their DNA-binding ability. We predicted the monomer structure of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 by AlphaFold2 ( Mirdita et al., 2022 ; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ). Hydrophobic surface analysis revealed that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 exposed four highly hydrophobic residues (L252, I254, I255, and L257) within the aggregation-prone sequence, while FLp53 exposes only one residue (L252) ( Figure 1C ). This increased hydrophobicity may induce the aggregation of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. Moreover, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 have a partial or complete structural loss of the \u03b2-hairpin S2\u2013S2\u2032 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ), which restricts access to the hydrophobic core ( Ca\u00f1adillas et al., 2006 ). This structural alteration results in an enhanced exposure of the hydrophobic core of the \u03b2-sandwich domain compared to FLp53 ( Figure 1C ). This exposure potentially facilitates the propensity for protein aggregation, as suggested by previous studies ( Ca\u00f1adillas et al., 2006 ; Olotu and Soliman, 2018 ) and our in vitro aggregation assay with purified FLp53, \u0394133p53, and \u0394160p53 proteins ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ). In summary, these findings suggest that the large N-terminal deletion in \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 would compromise the structural stability of FLp53 and induce aggregation, with \u0394160p53 being more severely affected among the two. \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 form complexes with FLp53 To investigate the oligomerization properties of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53, which retain the OD known to facilitate p53 tetramerization ( Clore et al., 1995 ), we co-expressed the FLAG-tagged p53 proteins as the baits along with the V5-tagged FLp53, \u0394133p53, and \u0394160p53 proteins as preys. The V5-tagged FLp53, \u0394133p53, and \u0394160p53 proteins specifically interacted with their corresponding FLAG-tagged proteins ( Figure 2A , lanes 1\u20136), demonstrating their capacity to form homo-oligomers ( Figure 2B ). In addition, interactions between FLp53-FLAG/\u0394133p53-V5, FLp53-FLAG/\u0394160p53-V5, \u0394133p53-FLAG/\u0394160p53-V5, and \u0394160p53-FLAG/\u0394133p53-V5 were found ( Figure 2A , lanes 7\u201310), suggesting that they can also form hetero-oligomers ( Figure 2B ). These findings are consistent with previous studies, indicating that \u039440p53 can hetero-oligomerize with FLp53 ( Courtois et al., 2002 ; Hafsi et al., 2013 ). To rule out the possibility that the observed interactions between FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 were artifacts caused by the FLAG and V5 antibody epitope tags, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged FLp53 with untagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FLAG-tagged FLp53 could still interact with the untagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , lanes 3 and 4), confirming the formation of hetero-oligomers between FLp53 and its isoforms. These findings demonstrate that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 can oligomerize with FLp53 and with each other. Figure 2. Complex formation among FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53.

Original membranes corresponding to Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 . \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 negatively influence FLp53\u2019s DNA-binding activity Previous studies have shown that the p53 lacking the TADs and the PRD (\u0394Np53DBD, residues 94\u2013393) retain full DNA-binding capacity as the FLp53 ( Emamzadah et al., 2014 ; Petty et al., 2011 ). In contrast, the \u0394133p53 (residues 133\u2013393) and \u0394160p53 (residues 160\u2013393) isoforms additionally lack part of the DBD (residues 94\u2013292). This deficiency raises questions about the impact of partial DBD deletion on the DNA-binding activity of p53. To address this question, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to measure the DNA-binding activity of FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 to several known p53-targeted promoters controlling proteins regulating cycle arrest (p21), protein stability (MDM2), and apoptosis induction (BAX and PUMA) ( Figure 3A ). Previous studies have classified p53 DNA-binding affinities. Accordingly, the p21 promoter has the highest affinity, the MDM2 promoter has moderate affinity, whereas the BAX and PUMA promoters show relatively low p53-binding affinity ( Park et al., 2012 ; Purvis et al., 2012 ; Weinberg et al., 2005 ). Consistent with these findings, our results revealed distinct binding affinities of the FLp53 protein to these target gene promoters ( Figure 3B ). Notably, the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms demonstrated a significant loss of DNA-binding activity at these promoters ( Figure 3B ). Figure 3. \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 negatively influence FLp53\u2019s DNA-binding activity. ( A ) Schematic representation of the promoters of p53 target genes (p21, MDM2, BAX, and PUMA). An arrow denotes the transcription start site (TSS). The DNA sequences of p53 response elements (REs) are shown, with uppercase and lowercase letters indicating matched and mismatched bases, respectively, in relation to the canonical p53 RE sequence (RRRCWWGYYY). Paired arrows highlight the regions subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification. Specifically, the distal (5') p53 RE within the p21 gene promoter was analyzed.

( C ) Relative DNA binding of the FLp53-FLAG protein to the p53 target gene promoters in the presence of the V5-tagged protein \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:1 ratio. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay data are shown as relative enrichment of promoter sequences of the target genes after normalization to the control, pcDNA3.1 plasmid transfected cells. Data are represented as the mean of technical triplicates \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), **p<0.01 (Student\u2019s t-test). Figure 3\u2014source data 1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay data corresponding to Figure 3B and C . We subsequently hypothesized that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 might compromise the DNA-binding ability of FLp53 through hetero-oligomer formation ( Figure 2 ). To study this, we co-transfected FLp53 along with either \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 expressing plasmid and measured FLp53\u2019s binding to the aforementioned promoters. The presence of \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 significantly reduced the binding of FLp53 to the p21 promoter, which has the highest affinity for FLp53, while having minimal impact on its interaction with the other promoters ( Figure 3C ). These findings suggest that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms may selectively impair the ability of FLp53 to bind to high-affinity target promoters. \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 impede FLp53-mediated transcription activation The p53-mediated transcription activation depends on its binding ability to specific p53REs at the target gene promoters ( Beckerman and Prives, 2010 ; Menendez et al., 2013 ). To evaluate the influence of the FLp53 protein interaction with its isoforms, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53, on transcription, we employed a luciferase reporter assay with the p21, MDM2, BAX, and PUMA promoters fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene. As expected, all four promoters were responsive to FLp53-mediated transcriptional activation ( Figure 4A\u2013D ). Notably, FLp53 activation of the PUMA promoter was relatively low, possibly due to the lower binding affinity of FLp53 to the PUMA promoter ( Figure 3B ). In contrast, neither \u0394133p53 nor \u0394160p53 activated any tested promoters ( Figure 4A\u2013D ), indicating a lack of functional capability to stimulate transcription from these promoters. Figure 4. Impact of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 on FLp53-activated transactivation. ( A\u2013D ) H1299 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids driven by p21 ( A ), MDM2 ( B ), BAX ( C ), and PUMA ( D ) promoters, along with vectors expressing FLp53, \u0394133p53, or \u0394160p53. To evaluate the influence of the isoforms on FLp53\u2019s transactivation capability, co-expression was performed at ratios of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 relative to FLp53. Basal promoter activity was determined by transfecting cells with the empty vector, pcDNA3.1. Relative promoter activity is shown after normalization to the pcDNA3.1-treated sample activity. Data represent mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) (n=3). *p<0.05; **p<0.01 (Student\u2019s t-test). ( E\u2013H ) The transcriptional activity of FLp53 on the p21 ( E ), MDM2 ( F ), BAX ( G ), and PUMA ( H ) promoters was inhibited by \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. Inhibition curve fitting was performed using the exponential function ExpDec1 in Origin 2018 software. Figure 4\u2014source data 1. Luciferase reporter assay data corresponding to Figure 4A\u2013D .

Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1. Predictive inhibitory capacity of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms in hetero- or homo-tetrameric complexes. ( A ) Mathematical modeling of tetramer formation probabilities ( Chan et al., 2004 ). The probabilities (p) of tetramer formation involving different combinations of FLp53(FL) and its isoforms (I) \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 are expressed. The ratio r is defined as the concentration of \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 relative to the concentration of FLp53. ( B\u2013E ) Prediction of isoform/FLp53 hetero-tetramer formation based on the data from Figure 4 . The promoter activity of p53 target genes p21 ( B ), MDM2 ( C ), BAX ( D ), and PUMA ( E ) was shown. For PUMA, promoter activities are normalized to the activity when \u0394133p53 and FLp53 are co-transfected at a 1:1 ratio. The predicted inhibition curves (black dots) are derived from the tetramer formation probabilities as shown in panel A. We hypothesize that the transcription factor is fully active only when it forms a tetramer consisting of 4FL; then, the final activity A equals P 4FL . Thus, A 4FL = P 4FL ; A 3FL = P 4FL + P 3FL ; A 2FL = P 4FL + P 3FL + P 2FL ; A 1FL = P 4FL + P 3FL + P 2FL + P 1FL . The experimental inhibition curves with \u0394133p53 (red) or \u0394160p53 (blue) were all above the theoretical inhibition curves for two isoform molecules per tetramer. Our analyses indicate that the \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 isoforms can exert an inhibitory effect on FLp53 function only when present in the tetramer in higher proportion than FLp53. In order to assess how \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 influence FLp53-mediated transcription on different p53-responsive promoters, we co-expressed FLp53 along with increasing amounts of \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 in H1299 cells. We found that co-expression of FLp53 with \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:1 ratio did not significantly alter the activation of the p21 and MDM2 promoters compared to FLp53 alone ( Figure 4A and B ). This result suggests that at an equal protein expression ratio, these isoforms did not exert a dominant-negative effect on the FLp53 at these promoters. However, a strong reduction in BAX promoter activation was evident under the same experimental condition ( Figure 4C ), suggesting that the isoforms can disrupt FLp53 function on the BAX promoter. Interestingly, both isoforms enhanced the activation of the PUMA promoter when added with FLp53 at a 1:1 ratio ( Figure 4D ). The elevated \u0394133p53 protein modulates p53 target genes such as miR-34a and p21, facilitating cancer development ( Fragou et al., 2017 ; Fujita et al., 2009 ). To mimic conditions where isoforms are upregulated relative to FLp53, we increased the ratios to 1:5 and 1:10. Adjusting the ratio of FLp53 to isoforms to 1:5 revealed that higher isoform expression levels significantly impaired FLp53-mediated activation of the p21, MDM2, and BAX promoters ( Figure 4A\u2013C ). Interestingly, \u0394133p53 at a 1:5 ratio had almost no impact on PUMA promoter activity, whereas \u0394160p53 reduced it compared to FLp53 alone ( Figure 4D ). These results indicate that higher expression ratios of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 relative to FLp53 might be required to exert dominant-negative effects. To test this hypothesis, we escalated the ratio of FLp53 to isoforms to 1:10. As expected, the activity of all four promoters decreased significantly at this ratio ( Figure 4A\u2013D ). Notably, \u0394160p53 showed a more potent inhibitory effect than \u0394133p53 at the 1:5 ratio on all promoters except for the p21 promoter, where their impacts were similar ( Figure 4E\u2013H ). However, at the 1:10 ratio, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 had similar effects on all transactivation except for the MDM2 promoter ( Figure 4E\u2013H ). This differential impact underscores the variability in how p53 isoforms influence FLp53 function across different promoters and expression ratios. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that isoforms with impaired DNA-binding capability can indeed exert dominant-negative effects on the function of FLp53, with the magnitude of this impact being promoter-specific and dependent on the relative expression levels of the proteins. The \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins affect the subcellular localization and aggregation of FLp53 p53 exerts its transcriptional activity in the nucleus, and its appropriate subcellular localization is crucial for regulating p53 functions ( Stommel et al., 1999 ). Immunoblotting analysis with isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions revealed distinct subcellular localization patterns for FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 ( Figure 5A and B ). The cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 was approximately 1.5-fold higher than that of FLp53 ( Figure 5B ). These results suggest that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 exhibit a greater tendency for cytoplasmic localization. Figure 5. Subcellular distribution of the FLp53, \u0394133p53, and \u0394160p53 proteins.

Immunofluorescence analysis of full-length p53 (FLp53) localization in H1299 cells. FLp53 protein was expressed in H1299 cells. To rule out the possibility that epitope tags might affect protein localization, H1299 cells expressing either FLp53-tagged or V5-tagged FLp53 were analyzed. Cell nuclei were visualized with DAPI (blue). The co-aggregation of isoforms with FLp53 in cytoplasm (white arrows) and nucleus (bright green arrows) is indicated. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1. Original immunofluorescence images corresponding to Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 . Immunofluorescence analysis of the cells expressing FLp53 and the two isoforms confirmed the above-observed protein localization pattern ( Figure 5C ). The FLp53 protein was predominantly localized in the nucleus, with minimal to no fluorescence signal detected in the cytoplasm ( Figure 5C , panel 1 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ). In contrast, the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins exhibited reduced nuclear staining and enhanced cytoplasmic staining relative to FLp53, with \u0394160p53 showing more pronounced cytoplasmic staining ( Figure 5C ). Notably, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution in the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Figure 5C , panels 2 and 3). Furthermore, both \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic punctate staining, particularly \u0394160p53, suggesting the formation of protein aggregates ( Figure 5C , panels 2 and 3). Given that p53 aggregation has been found in numerous tumor cells ( Costa et al., 2016 ; de Oliveira et al., 2015 ; Levy et al., 2011 ; Li et al., 2024 ), it is important to explore the effects of \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 isoforms on the aggregation of FLp53. To investigate the aggregation property of the p53 isoforms, we performed a subcellular fractionation of the H1299 cells expressing FLp53 along with \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:5 ratio. Notably, our fractionation approach allows us to analyze soluble cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as well as insoluble nuclear fraction. Immunoblotting of the soluble fraction showed that an excess of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms reduced the levels of FLp53 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with a notable reduction in the nucleus ( Figure 6A and C ). Conversely, insoluble nuclear FLp53 increased significantly upon co-expression with the p53 isoforms, with \u0394160p53 showing a more prominent effect ( Figure 6B and D , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ).

The insoluble nuclear fraction was run in SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-FLAG and anti-V5 antibodies. Histone H3 was employed as a nuclear marker.

To exclude the possibility that FLAG or V5 tags contribute to protein aggregation, we also conducted subcellular fractionation of H1299 cells expressing FLAG-tagged FLp53 along with untagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:5 ratio. The results showed ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) a similar distribution of FLp53 across cytoplasmic, nuclear, and insoluble nuclear fractions as in the case of tagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 ( Figure 6A\u2013D ). Notably, the aggregation of untagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 markedly promoted the aggregation of FLAG-tagged FLp53 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B and D ), demonstrating that the antibody epitope tags themselves do not contribute to protein aggregation. These results collectively demonstrate that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms strongly induce FLp53 aggregation, and the decrease in soluble FLp53 levels could be attributed to its aggregation when co-expressed with isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. We complemented the immunoblotting assays with immunofluorescence assays. Our results clearly show the co-localization of FLp53 with the isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. More importantly, we find co-aggregation of FLp53 with the two isoforms forming punctate spots in the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Figure 6E , panels 2 and 3 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ). Furthermore, more prominent subnuclear foci of FLp53 formed in the cells co-expressing the \u0394160p53 protein ( Figure 6E , panel 3 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ), which were detected in the \u0394133p53 protein expressing H1299 cells. Thus, these results imply that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms efficiently induce co-aggregation of FLp53, potentially influencing its function in cancer cells. The \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins block pro-apoptotic function of FLp53 One of the physiological read-outs of FLp53 is its ability to induce apoptotic cell death ( Aubrey et al., 2018 ). To investigate the effects of p53 isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 on FLp53-induced apoptosis, we measured caspase-3 and -7 activities in H1299 cells expressing different p53 isoforms ( Figure 7 ). Caspase activation is a key biochemical event in apoptosis, with the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3 and -7) ultimately leading to apoptosis ( Ghorbani et al., 2024 ). The caspase-3 and -7 activities induced by FLp53 expression were approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the control vector ( Figure 7 ). Co-expression of FLp53 and the isoforms \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a ratio of 1:5 significantly diminished the apoptotic activity of FLp53 ( Figure 7 ). This result aligns well with our reporter gene assay, which demonstrated that elevated expression of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 impaired the expression of apoptosis-inducing genes BAX and PUMA ( Figure 4G and H ). Moreover, a reduction in the apoptotic activity of FLp53 was observed irrespective of whether \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 protein was expressed with or without a FLAG tag ( Figure 7 ). This result, therefore, also suggests that the FLAG tag does not affect the apoptotic activity or other physiological functions of FLp53 and its isoforms. Overall, the overexpression of p53 isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 significantly attenuates FLp53-induced apoptosis, independent of the protein tagging with the FLAG antibody epitope. Figure 7. Overexpression of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 blocks pro-apoptotic activity of full-length p53 (FLp53). Caspase-3 and -7 activities were detected in H1299 cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing FLp53 and either \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:5 ratio. Experiments were performed with the plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged and untagged FLp53, \u0394133p53, and \u0394160p53. The relative activities of caspase-3 and -7 were normalized to those of the control vector (transfected only with the pcDNA3.1 plasmid). Data represent mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). **p<0.01 (Student\u2019s t-test). Figure 7\u2014source data 1. Data corresponding to Figure 7 , showing caspase-3 and -7 activities of H1299 cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing FLp53 and either \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:5 ratio. Discussion The inactivation of p53 is one of the most common events in cancer cells ( Kussie et al., 1996 ). Although functionally compromised p53 mutations are prevalent in more than half of human cancers ( Bykov et al., 2018 ; Hollstein et al., 1991 ), specific p53 isoforms have recently been associated with tumorigenesis in various cancer types ( Vieler and Sanyal, 2018 ; Zhao and Sanyal, 2022 ). The aberrant expression of \u0394133p53 has been found in colorectal cancer ( Campbell et al., 2018 ; Fujita et al., 2009 ) and lung cancer ( Fragou et al., 2017 ). In comparison, the oncogenic role of the \u0394160p53 isoform in human cancers is less explored ( Zhao and Sanyal, 2022 ), although links have been established between the expression of the \u0394160p53 isoform and melanoma cells ( Tadijan et al., 2021 ). The mechanisms of the oncogenic potential of p53 isoforms have attracted attention from researchers ( Arsic et al., 2021 ; Gong and Chen, 2016a ; Lei et al., 2019 ; Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019 ; Mondal et al., 2013 ; Vieler and Sanyal, 2018 ). A theory of the dominant-negative effect has been introduced, but its exact details have remained unknown. The ChIP and luciferase activity assays show that the isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 are defective in their ability to bind DNA and activate transcription ( Figures 3B and 4A\u2013D ). A possible reason for the diminished DNA-binding function of these isoforms is that their core domains are defective ( Figure 1B ). The \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms lack approximately 20% and 33% of the DBD, which hinders their ability to bind to p53REs. We find that co-expression of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 with FLp53 exerts an inhibitory effect on FLp53\u2019s DNA-binding ability ( Figure 3C ). However, the degree to which \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 impair FLp53 function is influenced by both the expression levels of these isoforms and the specific promoters of the target genes ( Figure 4 ). For the p21 and MDM2 promoters, equal expression of FLp53 and the two isoforms didn\u2019t show much effect. However, higher expression levels of the isoforms gradually inhibited FLp53\u2019s activity to induce transcription from those promoters ( Figure 4A and B ). Notably, the PUMA promoter behaved differently, whereby 1:1 co-expression of FLp53 with \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 significantly increased its activity ( Figure 4D ). We speculate that this isoform expression level may activate p21 induction pathways independent of FLp53 ( Karimian et al., 2016 ), potentially facilitating the interaction between FLp53 and p21, which is required for optimal activation of PUMA promoter activity ( Kim et al., 2022 ). These results underscore a complex regulatory network where FLp53 and the isoform expression levels, target gene specificity, and transcriptional activities modulate p53-mediated cellular responses. Our co-expression data clearly indicate that the isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 exert a dominant-negative effect on FLp53 function ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 7 ). Since both of these p53 isoforms are defective in DNA binding and they possess an intact C-terminal OD, it is not unexpected that they form different species of homo- and hetero-tetramers with FLp53. In accordance with that, the immunoprecipitation assays using FLAG-tagged FLp53 and V5-tagged/untagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 demonstrate a potential direct interaction between these isoforms and FLp53 ( Figure 2A , lanes 7 and 8 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , lanes 3 and 4). However, in what ratio the p53 isoforms impose inhibition to FLp53 function is worth investigating. We employed a theoretical model of p53 hetero-tetramer activity in transcriptional activation from p21, MDM2, BAX, and PUMA promoters by varying relative expression levels of the isoforms ( Chan et al., 2004 ; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ). We assumed that the transfection level was a good proxy for the expression level. Interestingly, the experimental inhibition curves with \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 derived from the luciferase reporter assay were all above the theoretical inhibition curves for two isoform molecules per tetramer ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E ), suggesting that at least three isoform molecules per tetramer are required to abolish the transcriptional activity of FLp53. This is similar to an earlier report with \u039440p53 isoform, which was shown to exert a dominant-negative effect at a 3:1 ratio with FLp53 ( Hafsi et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, similar to \u039440p53 ( Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019 ), the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins can aggregate in the cytoplasm ( Figures 5C and 6E ). Due to cytoplasmic aggregation and a stronger tendency for cytoplasmic localization ( Figure 5 ), only a limited amount of these isoforms can successfully be imported into the nucleus. Additionally, the isoforms tend to aggregate within the nucleus ( Figure 6B and E ). Consequently, the ratio of these isoforms to FLp53 diminishes in the nucleus in contrast to their expression levels. This decrease reduces the likelihood of forming hetero-tetramers, in which the isoforms will be in higher proportion than FLp53. Thus, it seems unlikely that hetero-tetramerization of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms with FLp53 would be the main reason for their dominant-negative effect. Next, we investigated whether aggregation of the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms contributes to their functional loss and dominant-negative effect on FLp53. Our immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analyses of H1299 cells expressing these isoforms show a higher aggregation propensity of the two isoforms than FLp53 ( Figure 5C , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ). The aggregation likely results from the exposure of hydrophobic sequences in the isoforms ( Figure 1C ). In addition, the absence of N-terminal TADs in \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms may prevent their MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome degradation ( Chen et al., 1993 ; Kussie et al., 1996 ). This may, in turn, lead to higher accumulation of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms in the cell, which, combined with an unstable core domain, promotes their aggregation. Moreover, the observed cytoplasmic isoform aggregates may reflect autophagy-related degradation, as suggested by the co-localization of \u0394133p53 with autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome component LC3B ( Horikawa et al., 2014 ). Overexpression of these aggregation-prone proteins could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate autophagy ( Lee et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, we also observed nuclear aggregation of these isoforms ( Figure 6B , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ), suggesting that distinct mechanisms, such as intrinsic properties of the isoforms, may govern their localization and behavior within the nucleus. This dual localization underscores the complexity of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 behavior in cellular systems. More interestingly, our immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate large co-aggregation of FLp53 with \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus when expressed together ( Figure 6E , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ). The predominant cytoplasmic aggregation would sequester FLp53 in the cytoplasm. Moreover, it may destabilize FLp53\u2019s conformation, potentially masking the NLS and preventing its nuclear import ( Marine, 2010 ). Additionally, it may disrupt the interaction of FLp53 with MDM2, thereby inhibiting its MDM2-induced degradation and enhancing its accumulation ( Moll and Petrenko, 2003 ), which would drive it more to the aggregation pathway. All these processes involving FLp53 aggregation would result in a reduction of the functional FLp53 in the cell and, more importantly, in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic aggregation would also limit the isoforms from nuclear import, reducing the possibility of hetero-tetramerization. Therefore, we propose that the co-aggregation of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 with FLp53 is the primary factor for their dominant-negative effect. This mechanism is consistent with the model where structural mutations, such as R175H and R282W in FLp53, induce co-aggregation and exert a dominant-negative effect ( Xu et al., 2011 ). In our study, we primarily utilized an overexpression strategy involving FLAG/V5-tagged proteins to investigate the effects of p53 isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 on the function of FLp53. To address concerns regarding potential overexpression artifacts, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) and caspase-3 and -7 activity ( Figure 7 ) experiments with untagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. In both experimental systems, the untagged proteins behaved very similarly to the FLAG/V5 antibody epitope-containing proteins ( Figures 6 and 7 , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ). Hence, the C-terminal tagging of FLp53 or its isoforms does not alter the biochemical and physiological functions of these proteins. We propose a model to explain how the p53 isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 inhibit FLp53 activity and exert a dominant-negative effect on it ( Figure 8A ). Two mechanisms are involved: a subsidiary mechanism in which \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms form hetero-tetramers with FLp53, impairing its DNA-binding and transcriptional activities, and a predominant mechanism in which these isoforms promote co-aggregation with FLp53 and abolish its transcriptional activities by disrupting its structure, regulation, and degradation pathways. Since elevated levels of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 relative to FLp53 attenuate its transcriptional activity ( Figure 8B , left), and overexpression of FLp53 relative to the isoforms allows regaining it ( Figure 8B , right), the tumor-suppressive efficacy of p53 must depend on the balanced expression of FLp53 and its isoforms, highlighting the importance of their relative abundance in cancer cells. Based on our results and recent related publications ( Arsic et al., 2021 ; Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019 ), we propose that co-aggregation, rather than hetero-tetramerization, is the primary mechanism for the dominant-negative effect exerted by the p53 isoforms with large N-terminal truncations. Figure 8. Schematic representation of the underlying mechanisms by which \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 exert a dominant-negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53). ( A ) When expressed alone, FLp53 demonstrates strong transcriptional activity, but when expressed together with the \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 isoforms, FLp53 activity gets impaired due to the dominant-negative effect exerted by the isoforms. The \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 isoforms either attenuate FLp53\u2019s transcription activity by hetero-tetramerization at a ratio higher than 1:1 or abolish it completely by aggregation. Since \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 exhibit much higher propensity for aggregation than FLp53, they sequester FLp53 in the cytoplasmic aggregates, leading to a reduction in the amount of functional FLp53 in the nucleus. Aggregation also limits the availability of these isoforms in the nucleus. Thus, co-aggregation is the primary reason for the dominant-negative effect of the \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 isoforms on FLp53. It is important to note that the numbers of tetramers and aggregates depicted do not represent the actual quantities present in the cytoplasm and nucleus. ( B ) The balance between the expression level of the FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 regulates FLp53 activity. Increased levels of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 relative to FLp53 lead to a stronger dominant-negative effect due to co-aggregation and hetero-tetramerization, resulting in the inhibition of apoptosis. Increased levels of FLp53 compared to the isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 in cancer cells restore the function of FLp53, leading to the induction of apoptosis. Materials and methods Cell lines, plasmids, and plasmid transfections Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells, NCI-H1299 cells, were from ATCC (RRID: CVCL_0060 ) and were also authenticated using STR profiling (Eurofins Genomics). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination (Mycoplasmacheck, Eurofins Genomics). H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A5256701) and penicillin-streptomycin solution (PEST; Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 15140122) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The plasmid pcDNA3.1-FLp53-FLAG, encoding human FLp53 (amino acids 1\u2013393), was synthesized by GenScript (Rijswijk, Netherlands). A flexible linker (GGGGG) 1 was introduced between the FLp53 coding sequence and the C-terminal FLAG epitope tag. Subsequently, this fusion construct was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector (RRID: Addgene_20140 ) at the NheI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. The plasmids encoding N-terminally truncated p53 proteins (\u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53) were created by deleting the N-terminal 132 and 159 amino acids from the FLp53 sequence, respectively. To create plasmids expressing C-terminal V5-tagged proteins (FLp53, \u0394133p53, and \u0394160p53), the respective DNA sequences were amplified by PCR from the pcDNA3.1-FLp53-FLAG template and inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1-V5. The plasmids encoding untagged p53 proteins were constructed by inserting the respective DNA sequences into the NheI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Luciferase reporter plasmids, WWP/p21-Luc (RRID: Addgene_16451 ) ( el-Deiry et al., 1993 ), pGL3-MDM2-Luc (RRID: Addgene_32369 ) ( Chang et al., 2004 ), and PUMA Frag1-Luc (RRID: Addgene_16591 ) ( Yu et al., 2001 ) were obtained from Addgene. For the construction of the BAX-Luc reporter plasmid, the p53 binding site in the BAX promoter was PCR-amplified from HepG2 genomic DNA kindly provided by Dr. Gang Pan (Uppsala University) and cloned into the pGL3-Basic plasmid (RRID: Addgene_212936 ) using XhoI and HindIII sites. The PCR primers used for cloning are listed in Supplementary file 1 . All plasmid transfections were performed with jetPRIME (Polyplus) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Immunoprecipitation and western blotting H1299 cells were seeded in a six-well plate and transfected with 2 \u03bcg of various plasmids. The total amount of plasmids (2 \u03bcg/well) was kept constant in all samples by adding empty plasmid pcDNA3.1. To investigate p53 oligomerization, cells were co-transfected with equal amounts (1 \u03bcg each) of FLAG- and V5-tagged plasmids. After 24 hr post-transfection (hpt), cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with the Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 78440) as previously described ( Inturi et al., 2013 ). The whole-cell lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. A fraction of the cleared cell lysates was reserved as the input sample; the remaining lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# M8823, RRID: AB_2637089 ) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed 4\u00d7 with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Proteins were then eluted from the beads using 2\u00d7 Laemmli Sample buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Cat# 1620112), and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hr at room temperature. The blocked membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F2555, RRID: AB_796202 ) and anti-V5 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# V8012, RRID: AB_261888 ) primary antibodies in a blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Proteins were detected with the IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Rabbit IgG and IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences). The western blots were visualized using an Odyssey CLX imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). ChIP assays H1299 cells were seeded in 10 cm cell culture dishes and transfected with 5 \u03bcg of either pcDNA3.1-FLp53-FLAG, pcDNA3.1-\u0394133p53-FLAG, pcDNA-\u0394160p53-FLAG, or an empty vector pcDNA3.1 for 24 hr. To investigate the impacts of isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 on the DNA-binding activity of FLp53, H1299 cells were co-transfected with 2.5 \u03bcg of pcDNA3.1-FLp53-FLAG along with either 2.5 \u03bcg of pcDNA3.1-\u0394133p53-V5, pcDNA3.1-\u0394160p53-V5, or an equal amount of empty vector pcDNA3.1. The ChIP assays were performed as described previously ( Punga and B\u00fchler, 2010 ), with minor modification. Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, followed by lysis in 250 \u03bcl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail. Lysates were then sonicated for 15 cycles (30 s ON/30 s OFF) using the Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode Cat# B01080010). The resulting soluble cell lysates were diluted with dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 167 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads. After a series of washes, protein-DNA complexes were eluted, and the cross-links were reversed through incubation with RNase A (Thermo Fischer Scientific Cat# EN0531) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by proteinase K (Invitrogen Cat# 25530049) digestion at 65\u00b0C overnight. The enrichment of specific DNA fragments was evaluated with qPCR analysis using HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Supermix (Solis Biodyne Cat# 08-36-00001). All qPCRs were done in triplicate, employing the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 4485691). The relative fold enrichments were calculated after normalizing to the input values and considering the pcDNA3.1 transfected samples as 1. Primer sequences used for qPCR analysis are listed in Supplementary file 1 . Luciferase assay H1299 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected in triplicate with 25 ng/well of luciferase reporter plasmids and various p53-expressing plasmids. Co-transfection ratios for FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 were set at 1:1 (12.5 ng/well of FLp53 to 12.5 ng/well of isoform), 1:5 (12.5 ng/well of FLp53 to 62.5 ng/well of isoform), and 1:10 (12.5 ng/well of FLp53 to 125 ng/well of isoform). The total plasmid amount (300 ng/well) was kept consistent across the various groups by supplementing with the empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Cells were harvested 24 hpt and lysed in a Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega Cat# E194A). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, and 20 \u03bcl of the lysate was analyzed in triplicates using a firefly luciferase substrate on Infinite 200 PRO plate reader (TECAN) ( Schubert et al., 2024 ). The luciferase activity of the FLp53 and its isoforms-transfected samples was normalized against that of samples transfected with the control vector pcDNA3.1 to obtain relative reporter activity. Results represent the mean values and standard deviations of three independent experimental replicates. The data was analyzed using Origin 2018 software (Origin Lab Corporation). Subcellular fractionation The subcellular fractionation assay was carried out using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 78833), with minor modifications. In brief, H1299 cells were seeded in 10 cm cell culture dishes and transfected with 0.8 \u03bcg of the following plasmids: pcDNA3.1-FLp53-FLAG, pcDNA3.1-\u0394133p53-FLAG, pcDNA-\u0394160p53-FLAG, and the control vector pcDNA3.1. To investigate the effects of overexpressing p53 isoforms on the subcellular localization of FLp53, co-transfection was performed using FLAG-tagged FLp53 and V5-tagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:5 ratio (0.8\u20134.2 \u03bcg). Cells were transfected with 5 \u03bcg of the empty vector pcDNA3.1 as a control. About 24 hpt, cells were collected by trypsinization, resuspended in ice-cold CER I buffer containing Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Subsequently, ice-cold CER II buffer was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytoplasmic extracts were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000\u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The nuclear pellet was then resolved in ice-cold RIPA buffer supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, subjected to vortex for 15 s every 10 min for a total of 40 min, and centrifuged at 14,000\u00d7 g for 10 min to obtain the soluble nuclear fraction. The insoluble nuclear pellet (i.e. insoluble nuclear fraction) was resuspended in RIPA buffer, an appropriate volume of 2\u00d7 Laemmli Sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated at 95\u00b0C until the pellet fully dissolved. For western blot experiments, equal volumes of each subcellular fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the nitrocellulose membranes were probed with the respective antibodies. Histone H3 (nuclear marker) and \u03b1-Tubulin (cytoplasmic marker) antibodies were used to verify the purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. All primary antibodies: anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F2555, RRID: AB_796202 ), anti-V5 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# V8012, RRID: AB_261888 and Sigma-Aldrich Cat# V8137, RRID: AB_261889 ), anti-Histone H3 (Abcam Cat# ab1791, RRID: AB_302613 ), and anti-\u03b1-Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# T6199, RRID: AB_477583 ) were incubated on membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C. The western blots were visualized using an Odyssey CLX imaging system, and the proteins were quantified using Image Studio Version 5.5 (LI-COR). Immunofluorescence analysis H1299 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with 250 ng/well of either pcDNA3.1-FLp53-FLAG, pcDNA3.1-\u0394133p53-FLAG, pcDNA-\u0394160p53-FLAG, or the control vector pcDNA3.1. To investigate whether an excess of p53 isoforms could influence the subcellular localization of FLp53, H1299 cells were co-transfected with 250 ng/well of pcDNA3.1-FLp53-FLAG along with 1000 ng/well of pcDNA3.1-\u0394133p53-V5, pcDNA3.1-\u0394160p53-V5, or pcDNA3.1. About 24 hpt, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature as described previously ( Kases et al., 2023 ). Fixed cells on coverslips were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies anti-FLAG (diluted 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F1804, RRID: AB_262044 ) and anti-V5 (diluted 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# V8137, RRID: AB_261889 ). Subsequently, coverslips were incubated with the Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-11001, RRID: AB_2534069 ) and/or Alexa Fluor 594 chicken anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (diluted 1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21442, RRID: AB_2535860 ) secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen Cat# P36961), and nuclei were counterstained using DAPI. Subcellular localization was visualized using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon, Japan). Images were processed using ImageJ software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 ) and subsequently arranged by Inkscape. Caspase-3/7 activity assay Caspase-3 and -7 activities were measured with a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit (Promega Cat# G8090) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, H1299 cells were seeded (5000 cells/well) into a white solid bottom 96-well plate and transfected in triplicate with 180 ng/well of plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged or untagged FLp53, \u0394133p53, \u0394160p53, or the empty vector control pcDNA3.1. To evaluate the effects of overexpression of isoforms on the apoptotic activity of FLp53, H1299 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding FLp53 (30 ng/well) with the control plasmid pcDNA3.1 (150 ng/well), or plasmids expressing isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 (150 ng/well), at a 1:5 ratio. After 28 hpt, caspase-3/7 substrate was added to each well and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Luminescence was recorded using an Infinite 200 PRO plate reader (TECAN). The background luminescence associated with the cell culture and assay reagent (blank reaction) was subtracted from the experimental values.

Through a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation, transcriptional reporter assays, subcellular localization analyses, and protein aggregation experiments, the authors provide solid evidence that these N-terminally truncated isoforms promote co-aggregation with FLp53, disrupting its transcriptional activity and cellular distribution. The revised manuscript successfully addresses prior reviewer concerns, and the findings are well supported by the experimental data. [Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by Review Commons .] 10.7554/eLife.106469.2.sa1 Reviewer #1 (Public review): Reviewer Summary: The authors have provided a mechanism by which how presence of truncated P53 can inactivate function of full length P53 protein. The authors proposed this happens by sequestration of full length P53 by truncated P53. In the study, the performed experiments are well described. Significance: The work in significant, since it points out more mechanistic insight how wild type full length P53 could be inactivated in the presence of truncated isoforms, this might offer new opportunity to recover P53 function as treatment strategies against cancer. Comments on latest version: The authors have made significant effort to address my concerns using the system available to them. I find the justifications provided in the rebuttal letter and the revised figures satisfactory. My initial concerns regarding the overexpression system have been largely addressed. However, the experimental system used by the authors lacks the means to measure the effect on endogenous p53, which remains a limitation. 10.7554/eLife.106469.2.sa2 Reviewer #2 (Public review): Reviewer Summary: The revised manuscript by Zhao and colleagues presents a novel and compelling investigation into the p53 isoforms, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53, which are implicated in aggressive cancer phenotypes. The primary goal of this study was to elucidate how these isoforms exert a dominant-negative impact on the activity of full-length p53 (FLp53). The authors demonstrate that the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms display impaired binding to p53-regulated promoters. Their findings suggest that the dominant-negative effects observed are primarily due to the co-aggregation of FLp53 with \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. Overall, the study is innovative, thoroughly executed, and supported by robust data analysis. The authors have effectively addressed the reviewers' criticisms and incorporated their suggestions in this revised manuscript.

Authors proposed this happens by sequestration of full length P53 by truncated P53. In the study, performed experiments are well described. My area of expertise is molecular biology/gene expression, and I have tried to provide suggestions on my area of expertise. The study has been done mainly with overexpression system and I have included few comments which I can think can be helpful to understand effect of truncated P53 on endogenous wild type full length protein. Performing experiments on these lines will add value to the observation according to this reviewer. Major comments: (1) What happens to endogenous wild type full length P53 in the context of mutant/truncated isoforms, that is not clear. Using a P53 antibody which can detect endogenous wild type P53, can authors check if endogenous full length P53 protein is also aggregated as well? It is hard to differentiate if aggregation of full length P53 happens only in overexpression scenario, where lot more both of such proteins are expressed. In normal physiological condition P53 expression is usually low, tightly controlled and its expression get induced in altered cellular condition such as during DNA damage. So, it is important to understand the physiological relevance of such aggregation, which could be possible if authors could investigate effect on endogenous full length P53 following overexpression of mutant isoforms. Thank you very much for your insightful comments. (1) To address \u201cwhat happens to endogenous wild-type full-length P53 in the context of mutant/truncated isoforms,\" we employed a human A549 cell line expressing endogenous wild-type p53 under DNA damage conditions such as an etoposide treatment(1). We choose the A549 cell line since similar to H1299, it is a lung cancer cell line ( https://www.atcc.org/ ). For comparison, we also transfected the cells with 2 \u03bcg of V5-tagged plasmids encoding FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. As shown in Author response image 1A, lanes 1 and 2, endogenous p53 expression, remained undetectable in A549 cells despite etoposide treatment, which limits our ability to assess the effects of the isoforms on the endogenous wild-type FLp53. We could, however, detect the V5-tagged FLp53 expressed from the plasmid using anti-V5 (rabbit) as well as with antiDO-1 (mouse) antibody (Author response image 1). The latter detects both endogenous wildtype p53 and the V5-tagged FLp53 since the antibody epitope is within the Nterminus (aa 20-25). This result supports the reviewer\u2019s comment regarding the low level of expression of endogenous p53 that is insufficient for detection in our experiments. In summary, in line with the reviewer\u2019s comment that \u2018under normal physiological conditions p53 expression is usually low,\u2019 we could not detect p53 with an anti-DO-1 antibody. Thus, we proceeded with V5/FLAG-tagged p53 for detection of the effects of the isoforms on p53 stability and function. We also found that protein expression in H1299 cells was more easily detectable than in A549 cells (Compare Author response image 1A and B). Thus, we decided to continue with the H1299 cells (p53-null), which would serve as a more suitable model system for this study. (2) We agree with the reviewer that \u2018It is hard to differentiate if aggregation of full-length p53 happens only in overexpression scenario\u2019. However, it is not impossible to imagine that such aggregation of FLp53 happens under conditions when p53 and its isoforms are over-expressed in the cell. Although the exact physiological context is not known and beyond the scope of the current work, our results indicate that at higher expression, p53 isoforms drive aggregation of FLp53. Given the challenges of detecting endogenous FLp53, we had to rely on the results obtained with plasmid mediated expression of p53 and its isoforms in p53-null cells. Author response image 1. Comparative analysis of protein expression in A549 and H1299 cells. (A) A549 cells (p53 wild-type) were treated with etoposide to induce endogenous wild-type p53 expression. To assess the effects of FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 on endogenous wild-type p53 aggregation, A549 cells were transfected with 2 \u03bcg of V5-tagged p53 expression plasmids, with or without etoposide (20\u03bcM for 8h) treatment. Western blot analysis was done with the anti-V5 (rabbit) to detect V5-tagged proteins and anti-DO-1 (mouse), the latter detects both endogenous wild-type p53 and V5-tagged FLp53. The merged image corresponds to the overlay between the V5 and DO1 antibody signals. (B) H1299 cells (p53-null) were transfected with 2 \u03bcg V5tagged p53 expression plasmids or the empty vector control pcDNA3.1. Western blot analysis was done with the anti-V5 (mouse) antibody. (2) Can presence of mutant P53 isoforms can cause functional impairment of wild type full length endogenous P53? That could be tested as well using similar ChIP assay authors has performed, but instead of antibody against the Tagged protein if the authors could check endogenous P53 enrichment in the gene promoter such as P21 following overexpression of mutant isoforms. May be introducing a condition such as DNA damage in such experiment might help where endogenous P53 is induced and more prone to bind to P53 target such as P21. Thank you very much for your valuable comments and suggestions. To investigate the potential functional impairment of endogenous wild-type p53 by p53 isoforms, we initially utilized A549 cells (p53 wild-type), aiming to monitor endogenous wild-type p53 expression following DNA damage. However, as mentioned and demonstrated in Author response image 1, endogenous p53 expression was too low to be detected under these conditions, making the ChIP assay for analyzing endogenous p53 activity unfeasible. Thus, we decided to utilize plasmid-based expression of FLp53 and focus on the potential functional impairment induced by the isoforms. (3) On similar lines, authors described: \"To test this hypothesis, we escalated the ratio of FLp53 to isoforms to 1:10. As expected, the activity of all four promoters decreased significantly at this ratio (Figure 4A-D). Notably, \u0394160p53 showed a more potent inhibitory effect than \u0394133p53 at the 1:5 ratio on all promoters except for the p21 promoter, where their impacts were similar (Figure 4E-H). However, at the 1:10 ratio, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 had similar effects on all transactivation except for the MDM2 promoter (Figure 4E-H).\" Again, in such assay authors used ratio 1:5 to 1:10 full length vs mutant. How authors justify this result in context (which is more relevant context) where one allele is Wild type (functional P53) and another allele is mutated (truncated, can induce aggregation). In this case one would except 1:1 ratio of full-length vs mutant protein, unless other regulation is going which induces expression of mutant isoforms more than wild type full length protein. Probably discussing on these lines might provide more physiological relevance to the observed data. Thank you for raising this point regarding the physiological relevance of the ratios used in our study. (1) In the revised manuscript (lines 193-195), we added in this direction that \u201cThe elevated \u0394133p53 protein modulates p53 target genes such as miR\u201134a and p21, facilitating cancer development(2, 3). To mimic conditions where isoforms are upregulated relative to FLp53, we increased the ratios to 1:5 and 1:10.\u201d This approach aims to simulate scenarios where isoforms accumulate at higher levels than FLp53, which may be relevant in specific contexts, as also elaborated above. (2) Regarding the issue of protein expression, where one allele is wild-type and the other is isoform, this assumption is not valid in most contexts. First, human cells have two copies of TPp53 gene (one from each parent). Second, the TP53 gene has two distinct promoters: the proximal promoter (P1) primarily regulates FLp53 and \u220640p53, whereas the second promoter (P2) regulates \u2206133p53 and \u2206160p53(4, 5). Additionally, \u2206133TP53 is a p53 target gene(6, 7) and the expression of \u0394133p53 and FLp53 is dynamic in response to various stimuli. Third, the expression of p53 isoforms is regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational processing(8). Moreover, different degradation mechanisms modify the protein level of p53 isoforms and FLp53(8). These differential regulation mechanisms are regulated by various stimuli, and therefore, the 1:1 ratio of FLp53 to \u2206133p53 or \u2206160p53 may be valid only under certain physiological conditions. In line with this, varied expression levels of FLp53 and its isoforms, including \u2206133p53 and \u2206160p53, have been reported in several studies(3, 4, 9, 10). (3) In our study, using the pcDNA 3.1 vector under the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, we observed moderately higher expression levels of \u2206133p53 and \u2206160p53 relative to FLp53 (Author response image 1B). This overexpression scenario provides a model for studying conditions where isoform accumulation might surpass physiological levels, impacting FLp53 function. By employing elevated ratios of these isoforms to FLp53, we aim to investigate the potential effects of isoform accumulation on FLp53. (4) Finally does this altered function of full length P53 (preferably endogenous one) in presence of truncated P53 has any phenotypic consequence on the cells (if authors choose a cell type which is having wild type functional P53). Doing assay such as apoptosis/cell cycle could help us to get this visualization. Thank you for your insightful comments. In the experiment with A549 cells (p53 wild-type), endogenous p53 levels were too low to be detected, even after DNA damage induction. The evaluation of the function of endogenous p53 in the presence of isoforms is hindered, as mentioned above. In the revised manuscript, we utilized H1299 cells with overexpressed proteins for apoptosis studies using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Figure 7). This has been shown in the Results section (lines 254-269). \u201cThe \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins block pro-apoptotic function of FLp53. One of the physiological read-outs of FLp53 is its ability to induce apoptotic cell death(11). To investigate the effects of p53 isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 on FLp53-induced apoptosis, we measured caspase-3 and -7 activities in H1299 cells expressing different p53 isoforms (Figure 7). Caspase activation is a key biochemical event in apoptosis, with the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3 and -7) ultimately leading to apoptosis(12). The caspase-3 and -7 activities induced by FLp53 expression was approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the control vector (Figure 7). Co-expression of FLp53 and the isoforms \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a ratio of 1: 5 significantly diminished the apoptotic activity of FLp53 (Figure 7). This result aligns well with our reporter gene assay, which demonstrated that elevated expression of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 impaired the expression of apoptosis-inducing genes BAX and PUMA (Figure 4G and H). Moreover, a reduction in the apoptotic activity of FLp53 was observed irrespective of whether \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 protein was expressed with or without a FLAG tag (Figure 7). This result, therefore, also suggests that the FLAG tag does not affect the apoptotic activity or other physiological functions of FLp53 and its isoforms. Overall, the overexpression of p53 isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 significantly attenuates FLp53-induced apoptosis, independent of the protein tagging with the FLAG antibody epitope.\u201d Referees cross-commenting I think the comments from the other reviewers are very much reasonable and logical. Especially all 3 reviewers have indicated, a better way to visualize the aggregation of full-length wild type P53 by truncated P53 (such as looking at endogenous P53# by reviewer 1, having fluorescent tag #by reviewer 2 and reviewer 3 raised concern on the FLAG tag) would add more value to the observation. Thank you for these comments. The endogenous p53 protein was undetectable in A549 cells induced by etoposide (Figure R1A). Therefore, we conducted experiments using FLAG/V5-tagged FLp53. To avoid any potential side effects of the FLAG tag on p53 aggregation, we introduced untagged p53 isoforms in the H1299 cells and performed subcellular fractionation. Our revised results, consistent with previous FLAG-tagged p53 isoforms findings, demonstrate that co-expression of untagged isoforms with FLAG-tagged FLp53 significantly induced the aggregation of FLAG-FLp53, while no aggregation was observed when FLAG-tagged FLp53 was expressed alone (Supplementary Figure 6). These results clearly indicate that the FLAG tag itself does not contribute to protein aggregation. Additionally, we utilized the A11 antibody to detect protein aggregation, providing additional validation (Figure 8 from Jean-Christophe Bourdon et al. Genes Dev. 2005;19:2122-2137). Given that the fluorescent proteins (~30 kDa) are substantially bigger than the tags used here (~1 kDa) and may influence oligomerization (especially GFP), stability, localization, and function of p53 and its isoforms, we avoided conducting these vital experiments with such artificial large fusions. Reviewer #1 (Significance): The work in significant, since it points out more mechanistic insight how wild type full length P53 could be inactivated in the presence of truncated isoforms, this might offer new opportunity to recover P53 function as treatment strategies against cancer. Thank you for your insightful comments. We appreciate your recognition of the significance of our work in providing mechanistic insights into how wild-type FLp53 can be inactivated by truncated isoforms. We agree that these findings have potential for exploring new strategies to restore p53 function as a therapeutic approach against cancer. Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity): The manuscript by Zhao and colleagues presents a novel and compelling study on the p53 isoforms, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53, which are associated with aggressive cancer types. The main objective of the study was to understand how these isoforms exert a dominant negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53). The authors discovered that the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins exhibit impaired binding to p53-regulated promoters. The data suggest that the predominant mechanism driving the dominant-negative effect is the coaggregation of FLp53 with \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. This study is innovative, well-executed, and supported by thorough data analysis. However, the authors should address the following points: (1) Introduction on Aggregation and Co-aggregation: Given that the focus of the study is on the aggregation and co-aggregation of the isoforms, the introduction should include a dedicated paragraph discussing this issue. There are several original research articles and reviews that could be cited to provide context. Thank you very much for the valuable comments. We have added the following paragraph in the revised manuscript (lines 74-82): \u201cProtein aggregation has become a central focus of modern biology research and has documented implications in various diseases, including cancer(13, 14, 15). Protein aggregates can be of different types ranging from amorphous aggregates to highly structured amyloid or fibrillar aggregates, each with different physiological implications. In the case of p53, whether protein aggregation, and in particular, co-aggregation with large N-terminal deletion isoforms, plays a mechanistic role in its inactivation is yet underexplored. Interestingly, the \u0394133p53\u03b2 isoform has been shown to aggregate in several human cancer cell lines(16). Additionally, the \u039440p53\u03b1 isoform exhibits a high aggregation tendency in endometrial cancer cells(17). Although no direct evidence exists for \u0394160p53 yet, these findings imply that p53 isoform aggregation may play a major role in their mechanisms of actions.\u201d (2) Antibody Use for Aggregation: To strengthen the evidence for aggregation, the authors should consider using antibodies that specifically bind to aggregates. Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We addressed protein aggregation using the A11 antibody which specifically recognizes amyloid-like protein aggregates. We analyzed insoluble nuclear pellet samples prepared under identical conditions as described in Figure 6B. To confirm the presence of p53 proteins, we employed the anti-p53 M19 antibody (Santa Cruz, Cat No. sc-1312) to detect bands corresponding to FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. The monomer FLp53 was not detected (Figure 8, lower panel, Jean-Christophe Bourdon et al. Genes Dev. 2005;19:2122-2137), which may be attributed to the lower binding affinity of the anti-p53 M19 antibody to it. These samples were also immunoprecipitated using the A11 antibody (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Cat No. AHB0052) to detect aggregated proteins. Interestingly, FLp53 and its isoforms, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53, were clearly visible with Anti-A11 antibody when co-expressed at a 1:5 ratio suggesting that they underwent co-aggregation. However, no FLp53 aggregates were observed when it was expressed alone (Author response image 2). These results support the conclusion in our manuscript that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 drive FLp53 aggregation. Author response image 2. Induction of FLp53 Aggregation by p53 Isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. H1299 cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged FLp53 and V5-tagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:5 ratio. The cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation, and the resulting insoluble nuclear pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer. The samples were heated at 95\u00b0C until the pellet was completely dissolved, and then analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the A11 antibody, which specifically recognizes amyloid protein aggregates, and the anti-p53 M19 antibody, which detects FLp53 as well as its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. (3) Fluorescence Microscopy: Live-cell fluorescence microscopy could be employed to enhance visualization by labeling FLp53 and the isoforms with different fluorescent markers (e.g., EGFP and mCherry tags). We appreciate the suggestion to use live-cell fluorescence microscopy with EGFP and mCherry tags for the visualization FLp53 and its isoforms. While we understand the advantages of live-cell imaging with EGFP / mCherry tags, we restrained us from doing such fusions as the GFP or corresponding protein tags are very big (~30 kDa) with respect to the p53 isoform variants (~30 kDa). Other studies have shown that EGFP and mCherry fusions can alter protein oligomerization, solubility and aggregation(18, 19) Moreover, most fluorescence proteins are prone to dimerization (i.e. EGFP) or form obligate tetramers (DsRed)(20, 21, 22), potentially interfering with the oligomerization and aggregation properties of p53 isoforms, particularly \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. Instead, we utilized FLAG- or V5-tag-based immunofluorescence microscopy, a well-established and widely accepted method for visualizing p53 proteins. This method provided precise localization and reliable quantitative data, which we believe meet the needs of the current study. We believe our chosen method is both appropriate and sufficient for addressing the research question. Reviewer #2 (Significance): The manuscript by Zhao and colleagues presents a novel and compelling study on the p53 isoforms, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53, which are associated with aggressive cancer types. The main objective of the study was to understand how these isoforms exert a dominant negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53). The authors discovered that the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 proteins exhibit impaired binding to p53-regulated promoters. The data suggest that the predominant mechanism driving the dominant-negative effect is the coaggregation of FLp53 with \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. We sincerely thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and positive comments on our manuscript and for highlighting the significance of our findings on the p53 isoforms, \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity): In this manuscript entitled \"\u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms of the tumor suppressor protein p53 exert dominant-negative effect primarily by coaggregation\", the authors suggest that the \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms have high aggregation propensity and that by co-aggregating with canonical p53 (FLp53), they sequestrate it away from DNA thus exerting a dominantnegative effect over it. First, the authors should make it clear throughout the manuscript, including the title, that they are investigating \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 since there are 3 \u0394133p53 isoforms (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), and 3 \u0394160p53 isoforms (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). Thank you for your suggestion. We understand the importance of clearly specifying the isoforms under study. Following your suggestion, we have added \u03b1 in the title, abstract, and introduction and added the following statement in the Introduction (lines 57-59): \u201cFor convenience and simplicity, we have written \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 to represent the \u03b1 isoforms (\u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1) throughout this manuscript.\u201d One concern is that the authors only consider and explore \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 isoforms as exclusively oncogenic and FLp53 dominant-negative while not discussing evidences of different activities. Indeed, other manuscripts have also shown that \u0394133p53\u03b1 is non-oncogenic and non-mutagenic, do not antagonize every single FLp53 functions and are sometimes associated with good prognosis.

Thank you very much for your comment and for highlighting these important studies. We agree that \u0394133p53 isoforms exhibit complex biological functions, with both oncogenic and non-oncogenic potentials. However, our mission here was primarily to reveal the molecular mechanism for the dominant-negative effects exerted by the \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 isoforms on FLp53 for which the \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 isoforms are suitable model systems. Exploring the oncogenic potential of the isoforms is beyond the scope of the current study and we have not claimed anywhere that we are reporting that. We have carefully revised the manuscript and replaced the respective terms e.g. \u2018prooncogenic activity\u2019 with \u2018dominant-negative effect\u2019 in relevant places (e.g. line 90). We have now also added a paragraph with suitable references that introduces the oncogenic and non-oncogenic roles of the p53 isoforms. After reviewing the papers you cited, we are not sure that they reflect on oncogenic /non-oncogenic role of the \u0394133p53\u03b1 isoform in different cancer cases. Although our study is not about the oncogenic potential of the isoforms, we have summarized the key findings below: (1) Hofstetter et al., 2011: Demonstrated that \u0394133p53\u03b1 expression improved recurrence-free and overall survival in a p53 mutant induced advanced serous ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential protective role in this context. (2) Bischof et al., 2019: Found that \u0394133p53 mRNA can improve overall survival in high-grade serous ovarian cancers. However, out of 31 patients, only 5 belong to the TP53 wild-type group, while the others carry TP53 mutations. (3) Knezovi\u0107 et al., 2019: Reported downregulation of \u0394133p53 in renal cell carcinoma tissues with wild-type p53 compared to normal adjacent tissue, indicating a potential non-oncogenic role, but not conclusively demonstrating it. (4) Gong et al., 2015: Showed that \u0394133p53 antagonizes p53-mediated apoptosis and promotes DNA double-strand break repair by upregulating RAD51, LIG4, and RAD52 independently of FLp53. (5) Gong et al., 2016: Demonstrated that overexpression of \u0394133p53 promotes efficiency of cell reprogramming by its anti-apoptotic function and promoting DNA DSB repair. The authors hypotheses that this mechanism is involved in increasing RAD51 foci formation and decrease \u03b3H2AX foci formation and chromosome aberrations in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, independent of FL p53. (6) Horikawa et al., 2017: Indicated that induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts that overexpress \u0394133p53 formed noncancerous tumors in mice compared to induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts with complete p53 inhibition. Thus, \u0394133p53 overexpression is \"non- or less oncogenic and mutagenic\" compared to complete p53 inhibition, but it still compromises certain p53-mediated tumor-suppressing pathways. \u201cOverexpressed \u0394133p53 prevented FL-p53 from binding to the regulatory regions of p21WAF1 and miR-34a promoters, providing a mechanistic basis for its dominant-negative inhibition of a subset of p53 target genes.\u201d (7) Gong, 2016: Suggested that \u0394133p53 promotes cell survival under lowlevel oxidative stress, but its role under different stress conditions remains uncertain. We have revised the Introduction to provide a more balanced discussion of \u0394133p53\u2019s dule role (lines 62-73): \u201cThe \u0394133p53 isoform exhibit complex biological functions, with both oncogenic and non-oncogenic potentials. Recent studies demonstrate the non-oncogenic yet context-dependent role of the \u0394133p53 isoform in cancer development. \u0394133p53 expression has been reported to correlate with improved survival in patients with TP53 mutations(23, 24), where it promotes cell survival in a nononcogenic manner(25, 26), especially under low oxidative stress(27). Alternatively, other recent evidences emphasize the notable oncogenic functions of \u0394133p53 as it can inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis by directly interacting with the FLp53 (4, 6). The oncogenic function of the newly identified \u0394160p53 isoform is less known, although it is associated with p53 mutation-driven tumorigenesis(28) and in melanoma cells\u2019 aggressiveness(10). Whether or not the \u0394160p53 isoform also impedes FLp53 function in a similar way as \u0394133p53 is an open question. However, these p53 isoforms can certainly compromise p53-mediated tumor suppression by interfering with FLp53 binding to target genes such as p21 and miR-34a(2, 29) by dominant-negative effect, the exact mechanism is not known.\u201d On the figures presented in this manuscript, I have three major concerns: (1) Most results in the manuscript rely on the overexpression of the FLAGtagged or V5-tagged isoforms. The validation of these construct entirely depends on Supplementary figure 3 which the authors claim \"rules out the possibility that the FLAG epitope might contribute to this aggregation. However, I am not entirely convinced by that conclusion. Indeed, the ratio between the \"regular\" isoform and the aggregates is much higher in the FLAG-tagged constructs than in the V5-tagged constructs. We can visualize the aggregates easily in the FLAG-tagged experiment, but the imaging clearly had to be overexposed (given the white coloring demonstrating saturation of the main bands) to visualize them in the V5-tagged experiments. Therefore, I am not convinced that an effect of the FLAG-tag can be ruled out and more convincing data should be added. Thank you for raising this important concern. We have carefully considered your comments and have made several revisions to clarify and strengthen our conclusions. First, to address the potential influence of the FLAG and V5 tags on p53 isoform aggregation, we have revised Figure 2 and removed the previous Supplementary Figure 3, where non-specific antibody bindings and higher molecular weight aggregates were not clearly interpretable. In the revised Figure 2, we have removed these potential aggregates, improving the clarity and accuracy of the data. To further rule out any tag-related artifacts, we conducted a coimmunoprecipitation assay with FLAG-tagged FLp53 and untagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms. The results (now shown in the new Supplementary Figure 3) completely agree with our previous result with FLAG-tagged and V5tagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms and show interaction between the partners. This indicates that the FLAG / V5-tags do not influence / interfere with the interaction between FLp53 and the isoforms. We have still used FLAGtagged FLp53 as the endogenous p53 was undetectable and the FLAG-tagged FLp53 did not aggregate alone. In the revised paper, we added the following sentences (Lines 146-152): \u201cTo rule out the possibility that the observed interactions between FLp53 and its isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 were artifacts caused by the FLAG and V5 antibody epitope tags, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged FLp53 with untagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FLAGtagged FLp53 could indeed interact with the untagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms (Supplementary Figure 3, lanes 3 and 4), confirming formation of hetero-oligomers between FLp53 and its isoforms. These findings demonstrate that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 can oligomerize with FLp53 and with each other.\u201d Additionally, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments to compare the aggregation and localization of FLAG-tagged FLp53 when co-expressed either with V5-tagged or untagged \u0394133p53/\u0394160p53. In these experiments, the untagged isoforms also induced FLp53 aggregation, mirroring our previous results with the tagged isoforms (Supplementary Figure 5). We\u2019ve added this result in the revised manuscript (lines 236-245): \u201cTo exclude the possibility that FLAG or V5 tags contribute to protein aggregation, we also conducted subcellular fractionation of H1299 cells expressing FLAG-tagged FLp53 along with untagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1:5 ratio. The results showed (Supplementary Figure 6) a similar distribution of FLp53 across cytoplasmic, nuclear, and insoluble nuclear fractions as in the case of tagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 (Figure 6A to D). Notably, the aggregation of untagged \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 markedly promoted the aggregation of FLAG-tagged FLp53 (Supplementary Figure 6B and D), demonstrating that the antibody epitope tags themselves do not contribute to protein aggregation.\u201d We\u2019ve also discussed this in the Discussion section (lines 349-356): \u201cIn our study, we primarily utilized an overexpression strategy involving FLAG/V5tagged proteins to investigate the effects of p53 isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 on the function of FLp53. To address concerns regarding potential overexpression artifacts, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation (Supplementary Figure 6) and caspase-3 and -7 activity (Figure 7) experiments with untagged \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53. In both experimental systems, the untagged proteins behaved very similarly to the FLAG/V5 antibody epitopecontaining proteins (Figures 6 and 7 and Supplementary Figure 6). Hence, the C-terminal tagging of FLp53 or its isoforms does not alter the biochemical and physiological functions of these proteins.\u201d In summary, the revised data set and newly added experiments provide strong evidence that neither the FLAG nor the V5 tag contributes to the observed p53 isoform aggregation. (2) The authors demonstrate that to visualize the dominant-negative effect, \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 must be \"present in a higher proportion than FLp53 in the tetramer\" and the need at least a transfection ratio 1:5 since the 1:1 ration shows no effect. However, in almost every single cell type, FLp53 is far more expressed than the isoforms which make it very unlikely to reach such stoichiometry in physiological conditions and make me wonder if this mechanism naturally occurs at endogenous level. This limitation should be at least discussed. Thank you for your insightful comment. However, evidence suggests that the expression levels of these isoforms such as \u0394133p53, can be significantly elevated relative to FLp53 in certain physiological conditions(3, 4, 9). For example, in some breast tumors, with \u0394133p53 mRNA is expressed at a much levels than FLp53, suggesting a distinct expression profile of p53 isoforms compared to normal breast tissue(4). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer and the A549 lung cancer cell line, the expression level of \u0394133p53 transcript is significantly elevated compared to non-cancerous cells(3). Moreover, in specific cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, the \u0394133p53 /TAp53 expression ratio has been reported to increase to as high as 3:1(9). These observations indicate that the dominant-negative effect of isoform \u0394133p53 on FLp53 can occur under certain pathological conditions where the relative amounts of the FLp53 and the isoforms would largely vary. Since data on the \u0394160p53 isoform are scarce, we infer that the long N-terminal truncated isoforms may share a similar mechanism. (3) Figure 5C: I am concerned by the subcellular location of the \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 as they are commonly considered nuclear and not cytoplasmic as shown here, particularly since they retain the 3 nuclear localization sequences like the FLp53 (Bourdon JC et al. 2005; Mondal A et al. 2018; Horikawa I et al, 2017; Joruiz S. et al, 2024). However, \u0394133p53\u03b1 can form cytoplasmic speckles (Horikawa I et al, 2017) when it colocalizes with autophagy markers for its degradation. The authors should discuss this issue. Could this discrepancy be due to the high overexpression level of these isoforms? A co-staining with autophagy markers (p62, LC3B) would rule out (or confirm) activation of autophagy due to the overwhelming expression of the isoform. Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We have thoroughly reviewed all the papers you recommended (Bourdon JC et al., 2005; Mondal A et al., 2018; Horikawa I et al., 2017; Joruiz S. et al., 2024)(4, 29, 30, 31). Among these, only the study by Bourdon JC et al. (2005) provided data regarding the localization of \u0394133p53(4). Interestingly, their findings align with our observations, indicating that the protein does not exhibit predominantly nuclear localization in the Figure 8 from Jean-Christophe Bourdon et al. Genes Dev. 2005;19:2122-2137. The discrepancy may be caused by a potentially confusing statement in that paper(4). The localization of p53 is governed by multiple factors, including its nuclear import and export(32). The isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 contain three nuclear localization sequences (NLS)(4). However, the isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 were potentially trapped in the cytoplasm by aggregation and masking the NLS. This mechanism would prevent nuclear import. Further, we acknowledge that \u0394133p53 co-aggregates with autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome component LC3B in cytoplasm by autophagic degradation during replicative senescence(33). We agree that high overexpression of these aggregation-prone proteins may induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates autophagy(34). This could explain the cytoplasmic localization in our experiments. However, it is also critical to consider that we observed aggregates in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figures 6B and E and Supplementary Figure 6B). While cytoplasmic localization may involve autophagy-related mechanisms, the nuclear aggregates likely arise from intrinsic isoform properties, such as altered protein folding, independent of autophagy. These dual localizations reflect the complex behavior of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 isoforms under our experimental conditions. In the revised manuscript, we discussed this in Discussion (lines 328-335): \u201cMoreover, the observed cytoplasmic isoform aggregates may reflect autophagy-related degradation, as suggested by the co-localization of \u0394133p53 with autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome component LC3B(33). High overexpression of these aggregation-prone proteins could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate autophagy(34). Interestingly, we also observed nuclear aggregation of these isoforms (Figure 6B and E and Supplementary Figure 6B), suggesting that distinct mechanisms, such as intrinsic properties of the isoforms, may govern their localization and behavior within the nucleus. This dual localization underscores the complexity of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 behavior in cellular systems.\u201d Minor concerns: - Figure 1A: the initiation of the \"\u0394140p53\" is shown instead of \"\u039440p53\" Thank you! The revised Figure 1A has been created in the revised paper. - Figure 2A: I would like to see the images cropped a bit higher, so the cut does not happen just above the aggregate bands Thank you for this suggestion. We\u2019ve changed the image and the new Figure 2 has been shown in the revised paper. - Figure 3C: what ratio of FLp53/Delta isoform was used? We have added the ratio in the figure legend of Figure 3C (lines 845-846) \u201cRelative DNA-binding of the FLp53-FLAG protein to the p53-target gene promoters in the presence of the V5-tagged protein \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 at a 1: 1 ratio.\u201d - Figure 3C suggests that the \"dominant-negative\" effect is mostly senescencespecific as it does not affect apoptosis target genes, which is consistent with Horikawa et al, 2017 and Gong et al, 2016 cited above. Furthermore, since these two references and the others from Gong et al. show that \u0394133p53\u03b1 increases DNA repair genes, it would be interesting to look at RAD51, RAD52 or Lig4, and maybe also induce stress. Thank you for your thoughtful comments and suggestions. In Figure 3C, the presence of \u0394133p53 or \u0394160p53 only significantly reduced the binding of FLp53 to the p21 promoter. However, isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 demonstrated a significant loss of DNA-binding activity at all four promoters: p21, MDM2, and apoptosis target genes BAX and PUMA (Figure 3B). This result suggests that \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 have the potential to influence FLp53 function due to their ability to form hetero-oligomers with FLp53 or their intrinsic tendency to aggregate. To further investigate this, we increased the isoform to FLp53 ratio in Figure 4, which demonstrate that the isoforms \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 exert dominant-negative effects on the function of FLp53. These results demonstrate that the isoforms can compromise p53-mediated pathways, consistent with Horikawa et al. (2017), which showed that \u0394133p53\u03b1 overexpression is \"non- or less oncogenic and mutagenic\" compared to complete p53 inhibition, but still affects specific tumor-suppressing pathways. Furthermore, as noted by Gong et al. (2016), \u0394133p53\u2019s anti-apoptotic function under certain conditions is independent of FLp53 and unrelated to its dominantnegative effects. We appreciate your suggestion to investigate DNA repair genes such as RAD51, RAD52, or Lig4, especially under stress conditions. While these targets are intriguing and relevant, we believe that our current investigation of p53 targets in this manuscript sufficiently supports our conclusions regarding the dominant-negative effect. Further exploration of additional p53 target genes, including those involved in DNA repair, will be an important focus of our future studies. - Figure 5A and B: directly comparing the level of FLp53 expressed in cytoplasm or nucleus to the level of \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 expressed in cytoplasm or nucleus does not mean much since these are overexpressed proteins and therefore depend on the level of expression. The authors should rather compare the ratio of cytoplasmic/nuclear FLp53 to the ratio of cytoplasmic/nuclear \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1. Thank you very much for this valuable suggestion. In the revised paper, Figure 5B has been recreated. Changes have been made in lines 214215: \u201cThe cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio of \u0394133p53 and \u0394160p53 was approximately 1.5-fold higher than that of FLp53 (Figure 5B).\u201d Referees cross-commenting I agree that the system needs to be improved to be more physiological. Just to precise, the D133 and D160 isoforms are not truncated mutants, they are naturally occurring isoforms expressed in almost every normal human cell type from an internal promoter within the TP53 gene. Using overexpression always raises concerns, but in this case, I am even more careful because the isoforms are almost always less expressed than the FLp53, and here they have to push it 5 to 10 times more expressed than the FLp53 to see the effect which make me fear an artifact effect due to the overwhelming overexpression (which even seems to change the normal localization of the protein). To visualize the endogenous proteins, they will have to change cell line as the H1299 they used are p53 null. Thank you for these comments. We\u2019ve addressed the motivation of overexpression in the above responses. We needed to use the plasmid constructs in the p53-null cells to detect the proteins but the expression level was certainly not \u2018overwhelmingly high\u2019. First, we tried the A549 cells (p53 wild-type) under DNA damage conditions, but the endogenous p53 protein was undetectable. Second, several studies reported increased \u0394133p53 level compared to wild-type p53 and that it has implications in tumor development(2, 3, 4, 9). Third, the apoptosis activity of H1299 cells overexpressing p53 proteins was analyzed in the revised manuscript (Figure 7). The apoptotic activity induced by FLp53 expression was approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the control vector under identical plasmid DNA transfection conditions (Figure 7). These results rule out the possibility that the plasmid-based expression of p53 and its isoforms introduced artifacts in the results. We\u2019ve discussed this in the Results section (lines 254269). Reviewer #3 (Significance): Overall, the paper is interesting particularly considering the range of techniques used which is the main strength. The main limitation to me is the lack of contradictory discussion as all argumentation presents \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 exclusively as oncogenic and strictly FLp53 dominant-negative when, particularly for \u0394133p53\u03b1, a quite extensive literature suggests a not so clear-cut activity. The aggregation mechanism is reported for the first time for \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1, although it was already published for \u039440p53\u03b1, \u0394133p53\u03b2 or in mutant p53. This manuscript would be a good basic research addition to the p53 field to provide insight in the mechanism for some activities of some p53 isoforms. My field of expertise is the p53 isoforms which I have been working on for 11 years in cancer and neuro-degenerative diseases Thank you very much for your positive and critical comments. We\u2019ve included a fair discussion on the oncogenic and non-oncogenic function of \u0394133p53 in the Introduction following your suggestion (lines 62-73).

    "full_text_abstract": "p53 is a tumor suppressor protein with multiple isoforms with shared or specific functions. However, two of its isoforms, \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1, with large N-terminal deletions, can cause cancer. These isoforms exert a dominant-negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53), although the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of action of \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 isoforms using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase expression, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence assays, and apoptotic caspase activity assay. Our study elucidates that these DNA-binding deficient p53 isoforms form hetero-tetrameric complexes with FLp53 and disrupt FLp53\u2019s DNA binding and transcriptional activities when present in a higher proportion than FLp53 in the tetramer. However, these structurally unstable isoforms promote vigorous protein aggregation involving FLp53, disrupting its structure and sequestering it in the cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates, thereby limiting its availability to function as a transcription activator protein. Thus, co-aggregation of \u0394133p53\u03b1 and \u0394160p53\u03b1 with FLp53, rather than hetero-tetramerization, is likely the primary factor contributing to their dominant-negative effect. Modulating the stability and aggregation of p53 isoforms could be a novel strategy for cancer therapy.\n\neLife digest Cancer is a deadly disease that continues to pose a major challenge to global healthcare systems. It arises when some cells acquire mutations that allow them to grow and divide uncontrollably. A key player for preventing this uncontrolled cell growth is the protein p53, which binds to DNA and regulates the activities of genes that determine whether a cell should grow, divide, or die. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 can hinder its ability to regulate gene activity, thereby contributing to cancer. Additionally, shorter versions of p53 \u2013 known as p53 isoforms \u2013 can accumulate in the cell and coexist with the normal full-length protein. These isoforms sometimes lack critical components of the protein, whilst retaining other properties. For example, two p53 isoforms \u2013 called \u2206133p53\u03b1 and \u2206160p53\u03b1 \u2013 are missing parts of the DNA-binding domain but can still bind to full-length p53 protein. Here, Zhao, Punga and Sanyal used biochemical and cell biology approaches to investigate how the \u2206133p53\u03b1 and \u2206160p53\u03b1 isoforms affect the activity of full-length p53. The team found that both isoforms can bind to full-length p53 protein and form tetramers, large molecules made up of four p53 sub-units. In addition, they found that the \u2206133p53\u03b1 and \u2206160p53\u03b1 isoforms can form aggregates with full-length p53. As a result, full-length p53 protein gets sequestered within these aggregates, which prevents them from binding to DNA and carrying out their role in gene expression and cell-death regulation. These findings open up new avenues for cancer research, particularly in cancer patients who have truncated isoforms of the p53 protein. Developing new therapies that prevent shorter and normal full-length p53 protein from forming irregular aggregates may have the potential to prevent, or slow, cancer progression in these patients."
