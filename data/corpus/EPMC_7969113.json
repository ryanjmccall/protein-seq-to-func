  "abstract_text": "NF-kappa B is an inducible transcription factor complex which regulates the expression of a variety of genes which are involved in the immune, inflammatory, and acute-phase responses. The maintenance of NF-kappa B activity in stimulated cells requires ongoing protein synthesis, suggesting several modes of regulation. In this report, we have characterized the transcriptional regulation of one family member, NF-kappa B2. The genomic structure and sequence of NF-kappa B2 revealed the presence of two promoters and at least four kappa B regulatory elements, which mediate responsiveness to phorbol myristate acetate and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Similar to other NF-kappa B family members, NF-kappa B2 is positively autoregulated. In contrast to other family members, we find that kappa B elements in the NFKB2 promoter can also mediate transcriptional repression in the absence of NF-kappa B. We identified a nuclear complex which binds specifically to a subset of kappa B-related sites but not to the canonical kappa B element. Because of its putative inhibitory or repressive effect, this binding activity has been termed Rep-kappa B. This mechanism of repressing basal NF-kappa B2 transcription in an inactivated state enables the cell to tightly control NF-kappa B2 activity. These data demonstrate that a novel mode of kappa B-dependent regulation is mediated by specific kappa B sites in the NFKB2 promoter.",
