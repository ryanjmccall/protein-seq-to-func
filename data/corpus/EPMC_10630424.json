    "abstract_text": "The conjugation of benzoyl-CoA with the aliphatic and acidic amino acids by glycine N-acyltransferase, as well as the amides of the latter group, was investigated. Bovine and human liver benzoyl-amino acid conjugation were investigated using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS). Bovine glycine N-acyltransferase catalyzed conjugation of benzoyl-CoA with Gly (Km(Gly) = 6.2 mM), Asn (Km(Asn) = 129 mM), Gln (Km(Gln) = 353 mM), Ala (Km(Ala) = 1573 mM), Glu (Km(Glu) = 1148 mM) as well as Ser in a sequential mechanism. In the case of the human form, conjugation with Gly (Km(Gly) = 6.4 mM), Ala (Km(Ala) = 997 mM), and Glu was detected. The presence of these alternative conjugates did not inhibit bovine glycine N-acyltransferase activity significantly. Considering the relatively low levels at which these conjugates are formed, it is unlikely that they will have a significant contribution to acyl-amino acid conjugation under normal conditions in vivo. However, their cumulative contribution to acyl-amino acid conjugation under metabolic disease states may prove to have a useful contribution to detoxification of elevated acyl-CoAs.",
