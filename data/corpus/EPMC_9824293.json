  "abstract_text": "Prop-1 is a newly isolated pituitary-specific paired-like homeodomain transcription factor whose cDNA sequence is well known in mouse. To study its involvement in human combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), we have isolated the human cDNA ortholog and determined the exon/intron organization and chromosomal localization of the human gene. A Prop-1 defect was characterized in three CPHD families. One missense mutation (R73C) involves a residue conserved in 95% of the more than 400 homeodomain proteins so far identified; in vitro splicing assays demonstrated the functional importance of the second defect, whereas the remaining mutation is a frameshift. Given the disease phenotype documented in the patients, these data, which will facilitate molecular investigations in other patients, demonstrate the crucial role of Prop-1 in the proper development of somatotrophs, lactotrophs, thyreotrophs and gonadotrophs.",
