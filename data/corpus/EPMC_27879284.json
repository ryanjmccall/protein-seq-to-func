Abstract Seipin is an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane protein implicated in lipid droplet ( LD ) biogenesis and mutated in severe congenital lipodystrophy ( BSCL 2). Here, we show that seipin is stably associated with nascent ER \u2013 LD contacts in human cells, typically via one mobile focal point per LD . Seipin appears critical for such contacts since ER \u2013 LD contacts were completely missing or morphologically aberrant in seipin knockout and BSCL 2 patient cells. In parallel, LD mobility was increased and protein delivery from the ER to LD s to promote LD growth was decreased. Moreover, while growing LD s normally acquire lipid and protein constituents from the ER , this process was compromised in seipin\u2010deficient cells. In the absence of seipin, the initial synthesis of neutral lipids from exogenous fatty acid was normal, but fatty acid incorporation into neutral lipids in cells with pre\u2010existing LD s was impaired. Together, our data suggest that seipin helps to connect newly formed LD s to the ER and that by stabilizing ER \u2013 LD contacts seipin facilitates the incorporation of protein and lipid cargo into growing LD s in human cells. electron microscopy lipid storage lipodystrophy membrane contact sites Subject Categories Membrane & Intracellular Transport Academy of Finland 272130 282192 284667 131650 1287975 The Finnish Medical Foundation Helsinki Biomedical Graduate School Sigrid Juselius Foundation Biocenter Finland Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale Aide aux Jeunes Diab\u00e9tiques Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone du Diab\u00e8te Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft SFB645 source-schema-version-number 2.0 component-id embj201695170 cover-date 15 December 2016 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.0.0 mode:remove_FC converted:19.12.2016 The EMBO Journal ( 2016 ) 35 : 2699 \u2013 2716 27879284 Introduction Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous cellular organelles consisting of a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer (Walther & Farese, 2012 ; Pol et al , 2014 ). They are key players in regulating lipid metabolism by storing lipids at times of excess and releasing them upon demand. The currently favored model of LD nucleation is that lipids accumulate within the ER bilayer in spatially restricted subdomains and bud off into the cytoplasm, with a proteomic fingerprint distinct from that of the ER (Ohsaki et al , 2014 ; Pol et al , 2014 ). LD growth is facilitated by localized activity of biosynthetic enzymes on LDs (Wilfling et al , 2013 ). For example, acyl\u2010CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3), which generates long\u2010chain acyl\u2010CoAs, was shown to control the number and size of LDs (Kassan et al , 2013 ), likely by activating fatty acids for neutral lipid synthesis on LDs (Fujimoto et al , 2007 ; Poppelreuther et al , 2012 ; Wilfling et al , 2013 ). After initial formation, LDs retain a functional connectivity with the ER, as manifested by their dynamic cargo exchange (Jacquier et al , 2011 ). Furthermore, live cell imaging demonstrated that LDs move in concert with the ER (Targett\u2010Adams et al , 2003 ; Guimaraes et al , 2015 ), and electron microscopy (EM) revealed an intimate morphological relationship between the ER and LDs (Robenek et al , 2006 ; Ohsaki et al , 2008 ; Wolinski et al , 2011 ). However, proteins responsible for the maintenance of ER\u2013LD contacts are so far unknown. Seipin/BSCL2 was first identified as a causative gene of Berardinelli\u2013Seip congenital lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2), the most severe form of lipodystrophy in humans, characterized by near complete lack of adipose tissue and subsequent metabolic disturbances (Magr\u00e9 et al , 2001 ). While studies in mammalian systems indicate that the protein plays a key role in adipocyte development (Payne et al , 2008 ; Chen et al , 2009 ), its molecular function remains open. Seipin is a ubiquitously expressed, oligomeric ER transmembrane protein (Binns et al , 2010 ). It is evolutionarily conserved, with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fld1 being the most extensively studied seipin ortholog. In the absence of seipin/Fld1, LDs appear smaller and aggregated, and sometimes supersized (Szymanski et al , 2007 ; Fei et al , 2008 ; Boutet et al , 2009 ). Several studies have identified aberrant protein composition of LDs in yeast cells lacking Fld1 (Fei et al , 2011 ; Wang et al , 2014 ; Cartwright et al , 2015 ; Grippa et al , 2015 ). Fld1 interacts with and stabilizes another ER membrane protein Ldb16 (Wang et al , 2014 ), which collaborates with Fld1 to control LD biogenesis and is localized to ER\u2013LD junctions by immuno\u2010EM (Grippa et al , 2015 ). Moreover, in Ldb16 \u0394 yeast ER\u2013LD contacts were enlarged, with conspicuous ER protrusions surrounding aggregated LDs (Grippa et al , 2015 ). In this study, we characterize ER\u2013LD contacts and their functionality in wild\u2010type and seipin\u2010deficient human cells, including primary BSCL2 patient cells and cell lines harboring WT\u2010 or BSCL2\u2010causing mutant seipin. We provide evidence that seipin is stably localized to ER\u2013LD contact sites and regulates the contacts of newly formed LDs with the ER, facilitating the transfer of protein and lipid cargo between them. Results WT\u2010seipin but not BSCL2\u2010mutant rescues aberrant LD biogenesis of seipin knockout cells To investigate the role of seipin in LD biogenesis, we knocked out seipin from human A431 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system ( Appendix Fig S1 ). As reported in yeast (Szymanski et al , 2007 ) and human cells (Boutet et al , 2009 ), perturbation of seipin function resulted in aberrant LD morphology. After a 3\u2010day delipidation followed by 1\u2010h oleic acid (OA) incubation to induce LD biogenesis, LDs in seipin knockout (SKO) cells were more numerous and heterogeneous in size. While some SKO cells harbored 1\u20134 large LDs, the vast majority of LDs in SKO were markedly smaller than in control cells (Figs 1 A and B, and EV1 A). These represented newly formed LDs, as they were not detected after delipidation (Fig EV1 B). Similar aberrant LD morphology was also observed in SKO cells grown in normal growth medium (Fig EV1 C). The content of neutral lipids was decreased in SKO cells (Fig EV1 D), analogously to BSCL2 patient cells (Boutet et al , 2009 ).

We then introduced GFP\u2010tagged human WT\u2010seipin to the SKO cells and selected a clone with a low expression level of WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP (Fig EV1 E). In the WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP\u2010expressing cell line, the defects in LD morphology and neutral lipid content were rescued (Figs 1 A and B, and EV1 D). In contrast, in a SKO cell line with a similarly expressed GFP\u2010tagged BSCL2\u2010causing point mutant seipin variant (Magr\u00e9 et al , 2001 ) (A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP), the aberrant LD biogenesis and neutral lipid storage defects were not corrected (Figs 1 A and B, and EV1 D and F). WT\u2010seipin but not BSCL2\u2010mutant is enriched at ER\u2013LD contact sites We next investigated the subcellular localization of WT\u2010 and A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP. Under normal growth conditions, both WT\u2010 and A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP showed a reticular ER pattern, but WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP exhibited a more punctate distribution (Fig 1 C). By stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) using anti\u2010GFP immunolabeling ( Appendix Fig S2 ), both WT\u2010 and A212P\u2010seipin were observed as discrete dotty or disk\u2010like structures (Fig 1 D). The A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP structures appeared smaller (diameter peak at ~35\u201340 nm) than the WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP structures (~40\u201350 nm) (Fig EV1 G), likely reflecting their assembly into smaller oligomers, as suggested (Binns et al , 2010 ; Sim et al , 2013 ). To study seipin localization in relation to LDs, we conducted 3D\u2010structured illumination microscopy (3D\u2010SIM) on cells with a low level of GFP fluorescence. This revealed that ~95% of newly formed LDs had at least one WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP puncta directly adjacent (Fig 1 E and F). The LD size did not clearly correlate with the number of seipin punctae associated with it (Fig EV1 H). Also by immuno\u2010EM, WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP was enriched at ER\u2013LD contact sites, contrary to A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP (Fig 1 G and H, and Appendix Fig S3 ). Yet, as the sample processing for immuno\u2010EM partially perturbed the contours of membrane bound organelles, these data should be interpreted with caution. Finally, to investigate endogenous seipin localization, we tagged the protein at its chromosomal locus (end\u2010seipin\u2010sfGFP; Appendix Fig S4 ). This confirmed the specific association of seipin at ER\u2013LD contact sites (Fig 1 I), with virtually all LDs harboring at least one seipin punctum. Thus, both WT\u2010seipin and a BSCL2\u2010causing point mutant form discrete structures in the ER, but the WT protein is highly enriched at ER\u2013LD contact sites while the mutant is not, arguing for the functional relevance of this location. WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP is stably associated with LDs in living cells To characterize the dynamics of seipin localization, we performed high\u2010resolution imaging of live cells. Upon incubation with OA for 30\u201375 min to induce LD biogenesis, two populations of WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP puncta were apparent: those associated with LDs and those without LD associations. Both populations were mobile but the latter displayed considerably faster movements (Figs 2 A and B, and EV2 A). The association of seipin\u2010GFP with LDs appeared stable during the observation period (up to 120 s) with seipin\u2010GFP dots hovering around the LD ( Movie EV1 ) or moving together with it (Fig 2 A, lower panel). Thus, LDs exhibit a close physical relationship with the ER, with seipin stably localizing at the ER\u2013LD junctions. Figure 2 Seipin is stably associated with LD s, and lack of seipin results in loss of LD contacts with the ER SKO cells stably expressing WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP cells were delipidated and then incubated with OA and LipidTox Deep Red for 30\u201375 min.

A subset of LDs in SKO cells display increased mobility and lack physical ER contact We next examined the dynamics of LDs in WT and SKO cells. In control cells treated with OA for 45\u201360 min, LDs were often relatively immobile, with occasional short bouts of faster, unidirectional movement likely representing LD transport along microtubules (Targett\u2010Adams et al , 2003 ; Shubeita et al , 2008 ; Herms et al , 2015 ). In SKO cells, LD mobility was increased, with some of the small LDs displaying strikingly aberrant multidirectional trajectories, and high mean and maximum velocities (Figs 2 C\u2013E and EV2 B and C, and Movie EV2 ). This phenomenon was also observed in LDs formed under normal growth conditions (Fig EV2 D\u2013F). We then imaged the movement of newly formed LDs in relation to the ER, focusing on peripheral areas of the cells where the ER network was less dense allowing better visualization. In control cells, two modes of LD movement relative to the ER were observed: (i) LDs that appeared stably associated with the ER and moved together with it and (ii) LDs that traveled vectorially along the ER (Fig 2 F\u2013H and Movie EV3 ). Remarkably, in SKO cells, some LDs also moved independently of the ER and with higher velocities (Figs 2 F\u2013H and EV2 G, and Movie EV3 ). This ER\u2010independent LD mobility was rescued upon stable expression of WT\u2010 but not A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP (Fig EV2 H). To confirm the apparent loss of ER\u2013LD contacts in SKO cells, we examined the 3D ultrastructure of LDs in WT and SKO cells using serial block\u2010face scanning EM (SB\u2010EM). For cytochemical staining of the ER, we generated cell lines expressing Hsp47, an ER\u2010resident chaperone (Kano et al , 2005 ) fused with APEX, an EM reporter (Martell et al , 2012 ). Delipidated WT and SKO cells were treated with OA for 1 h and imaged using SB\u2010EM, and ER and LD profiles were modeled (Fig 2 I). We found that the vast majority of LDs in SKO cells were smaller and more homogeneous in size (~200 nm diameter) than in WT cells (Fig 2 J). Within the resolution of the system (~20 nm in XY, ~40 nm in Z), all LDs in WT cells were in close proximity to the ER, as judged by the continuity of the LD profile with the ER profile. Strikingly, in SKO cells a subset of the small LDs (about 10% of LDs per region of interest) showed no contact with the ER, with their distance to closest ER membranes ranging from 20 to up to 460 nm (Figs 2 K and EV3 A). In contrast, all the large LDs visualized from SKO cells were in the proximity of the ER (Fig EV3 B). Figure EV3 Additional SB\u2010EM models of LDs and ER in SKO cells In relation to Fig 2 I\u2013K.

In relation to Fig 2 I\u2013K, an example of a large SKO cell LD, showing ER proximity. Aberrant morphology of ER\u2013LD contacts in SKO cells We next examined the detailed morphology of ER\u2013LD junctions in WT and SKO cells using electron tomography (ET; digital isotropic resolution ~2.8 nm). The ER\u2013LD contacts of WT cells appeared well\u2010delineated and morphologically uniform: the ER typically formed a foot\u2010like process that touched the LD surface within a small area (Fig 3 A), in accordance with earlier findings (Kassan et al , 2013 ; Wilfling et al , 2013 ). At such contacts, the membrane profile often appeared darker and thicker, but we did not observe direct membrane continuities between the ER and LD membranes. 3D modeling revealed several discrete patch\u2010like ER contacts per LD (Fig 3 B and Movies EV4 and EV5 ). In contrast, in SKO cells, the contacts appeared heterogeneous and irregular. Some LDs exhibited very extensive ER contacts (Fig 3 A), with modeling showing a web\u2010like ER attachment (Fig 3 B and Movies EV6 and EV7 ), while others (~20%) displayed narrow, string\u2010like bridges to the ER that were not observed in control cells (Fig 3 A). When the extent of ER\u2013LD contacts was evaluated, we found a striking heterogeneity in the extent of ER\u2013LD contacts in SKO cells (total ER\u2013LD contact area per LD: 0.022\u20130.053 \u03bcm 2 in WT cells vs. 0.012\u20130.105 \u03bcm 2 in SKO cells, n = 4\u20135 LDs). As the SKO LDs were smaller, the fraction of the LD surface associated with the ER was, on average, larger in SKO cells (3.2 \u00b1 1.7% of total LD area in WT vs. 9.5 \u00b1 4.5% in SKO, \u00b1 SD). Also with this resolution, a complete LD profile with no ER contact was recorded in SKO cells ( Movie EV8 ). Together, these data suggest that seipin controls the extent of ER\u2013LD contacts, as seipin loss is accompanied by missing, rudimentary, or very large ER\u2013LD contacts. Figure 3 ER \u2013 LD contacts and ER morphology are aberrant in SKO cells WT and SKO cells were treated with OA for 1 h and processed for ET.

When assessing the ER ultrastructure, we noted that in SKO cells, the ER appeared occasionally expanded in the vicinity of LDs (Fig 3 A). To address whether this was restricted to ER\u2013LD contact sites, we performed TEM of cells incubated with OA for 1 h. This revealed a significant widening of the overall ER diameter in SKO cells (width of ~40 nm in WT cells vs. ~50 nm in SKO cells; Fig 3 C and D). LDs generated in SKO cells show defective targeting of the ER membrane protein ACSL3\u2010Cherry We next investigated how select LD proteins associate with LDs in WT and SKO cells. To this end, we generated WT and SKO cells expressing ACSL3\u2010Cherry, an ER membrane protein that marks lipogenic ER subdomains and nascent LDs (Kassan et al , 2013 ). In these cells, we also transiently expressed a GFP\u2010fused adipose\u2010differentiation\u2010related protein (ADRP), which is recruited to LDs from the cytoplasm (Brasaemle et al , 1997 ). Upon 1\u2010h incubation with OA, ADRP\u2010GFP was efficiently recruited to newly formed LDs in both WT and SKO cells (Fig 4 A and B). In WT cells, ACSL3\u2010Cherry partially retained a reticular pattern, but additionally localized to the newly formed LDs. In contrast, in SKO cells ACSL3\u2010Cherry did not concentrate on LDs but remained almost exclusively in the ER (Fig 4 A and B). Similar results were obtained in live cells when these proteins were expressed individually (Fig EV4 A). Figure 4 Endogenous ACSL 3 accumulates at ER \u2013 LD junctions in SKO cells WT and SKO cells stably expressing ACSL3\u2010Cherry were transfected with ADRP\u2010GFP for 24 h, incubated with OA for 1 h, fixed, and stained with LD540.

Bars: mean % of LDs/cell in the indicated category \u00b1 SEM, n = 10\u201312 cells (1,443\u20132,770 LDs), two experiments, ** P < 0.005 (unpaired t \u2010test). To further characterize defective ACSL3 trafficking in the absence of seipin, we conducted cell fusion experiments. We fused cells expressing ADRP\u2010GFP on newly formed LDs with delipidated cells lacking LDs and containing ACSL3\u2010Cherry in the ER. When both cell pools represented WT genotype, ACSL3 recruitment to ADRP\u2010labeled LDs was readily evident (Fig 4 C and D). This suggests that cell fusion and subsequent fusion of ER membranes (Kaprielian et al , 1996 ) allowed ACSL3 to move via ER\u2013LD contacts to the surface of LDs. In contrast, this recruitment was perturbed when SKO cells were fused together (Fig 4 C and D). However, ACSL3 derived from SKO ER did gain access to WT LDs (Fig 4 C and D), likely because of functional ER\u2013LD contacts preserved in WT cells. Strikingly, LDs generated in SKO cells failed to recruit ACSL3 deriving from a WT ER (Fig 4 C and D). This suggests that seipin needs to be present during LD formation, as reintroducing seipin to SKO cells with pre\u2010existing LDs failed to facilitate ACSL3 LD recruitment. Endogenous ACSL3 accumulates in the ER and ER\u2013LD junctions in SKO cells We next examined the distribution of endogenous ACSL3 (Fig EV4 B). In delipidated cells, ACSL3 showed a reticular staining pattern with fine punctae, suggesting localization in a lipogenic ER subdomain (Kassan et al , 2013 ). These domains were largely segregated from areas marked by WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP (Fig EV4 C). A 15\u2010min treatment with OA caused the appearance of more prominent ACSL3 punctae, likely representing newly forming LDs (Kassan et al , 2013 ). In these conditions, WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP punctae were observed in close apposition and partly overlapping with the ACSL3 signal (Fig EV4 C). Upon 1\u2010h OA loading of WT cells, endogenous ACSL3 was observed mostly in ring\u2010like structures surrounding small LDs or in dot\u2010like structures completely overlapping with them (Fig 4 E and F). Virtually all LDs showed a clear accumulation of ACSL3. In contrast, in SKO cells ACSL3 did not accumulate on the surfaces of small LDs but often concentrated on one side of them (Fig 4 E and F). The few LDs in SKO cells that harbored ring\u2010like ACSL3 staining were > 0.5 \u03bcm in diameter. This ACSL3 mistargeting was rescued in SKO cells expressing WT\u2010, but not A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP (Fig EV4 D and E). To address endogenous ACSL3 localization in more detail, we performed immuno\u2010EM. In WT cells treated with OA for 1 h, ACSL3 labeling typically decorated the cytoplasmic side of the LD surface (Fig 4 G), indicating localization on the LD phospholipid monolayer. In SKO cells, ACSL3 labeling was often restricted to ER\u2013LD junctions, with the cytoplasmic face of LDs devoid of signal (Fig 4 G). Image analysis of WT cells revealed ACSL3 localization on the LD monolayer and LD\u2010ER contacts, whereas in SKO cells, 18% of LDs showed ACSL3 label exclusively at the ER\u2013LD junctions and 30% of LDs were completely devoid of ACSL3, showing labeling only outside the LDs in the ER (Fig 4 H). Defective cargo exchange between the ER and LDs in SKO cells Acyl\u2010CoA synthetase 3 localization to LDs depends on its N\u2010terminal hydrophobic region postulated to form an alpha\u2010helical secondary structure (Poppelreuther et al , 2012 ), and the protein presumably moves to LDs via ER\u2013LD contacts. We next asked whether seipin deficiency induces a general defect in the translocation of ER proteins to LDs. To address this, we employed HPos, a model peptide harboring the hydrophobic domain of ALDI for ER insertion and the LD\u2010targeting sequence of caveolin\u20101 (Kassan et al , 2013 ). This peptide was shown to translocate from the ER to nascent LDs within minutes after fatty acid administration. Accordingly, we observed that HPos\u2010Cherry was efficiently targeted to forming LDs in WT cells, very similar to ACSL3\u2010Cherry (Fig EV5 A). Interestingly, the recruitment of HPos\u2010Cherry to nascent LDs was not prevented in SKO cells and the peptide could also reach LDs devoid of endogenous ACSL3 (Fig EV5 A\u2013C). Figure EV5 Additional information on HPos\u2010Cherry ER\u2013LD trafficking WT and SKO cells stably expressing ACSL3\u2010 or HPos\u2010Cherry were incubated with OA for 1 h, fixed, and stained with LD540.

Also shown are curve fits of the recovery curves. Data for LD recovery are the same as in Fig 5 B. We next examined the kinetics of HPos\u2010Cherry ER\u2013LD trafficking with fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. We induced LD biogenesis by incubating cells with OA for 2 h which resulted in the recruitment of HPos\u2010Cherry to LDs in both WT and SKO cells. We then bleached the HPos\u2010Cherry signal at LDs and monitored recovery to LDs. For FRAP analysis, we focused on LDs that were relatively immobile, to avoid detection inaccuracies resulting from fast LD movements. In WT cells, there was a clear recovery and re\u2010accumulation of HPos\u2010Cherry to LDs via the ER (Figs 5 A and B, and EV5 D). However, in SKO cells the recovery of HPos was severely impaired (Figs 5 A and B, and EV5 D). Yet, the mobility of this peptide in the ER was similar in both WT and SKO cells under normal growth conditions (Fig EV5 E). It is thus plausible that the initial rapid recovery, similar in WT and SKO cells, reflects the fast recovery of the peptide in the ER, and the slower component, severely attenuated in SKO cells, the return of HPos to the LD monolayer. Together, these data suggest that the initial accumulation of HPos to forming LDs was preserved in SKO cells, but subsequent movement to pre\u2010existing LDs was compromised. Figure 5 Defective ER \u2013 LD cargo trafficking in SKO cells WT and SKO cells stably expressing HPos\u2010Cherry were incubated with OA for 4 h, and LDs were labeled with LipidTox Green.

Delipidated WT and SKO cells were pulsed for 10 min with 0.1 mM alkyne\u2010OA either directly (1\u20132) or after pre\u2010incubation with 0.1 mM OA for 1 h (3\u20134). After alkyne\u2010OA incubation cells were collected (1 and 3) or further incubated for 20 min in 10% FBS medium (2) or 0.1 mM OA medium (4). Bars: % of alkyne\u2010OA in neutral lipids (triacylglycerol and cholesterol esters), normalized to WT pulse (1), \u00b1 SEM, n = 6\u20139 samples, 2\u20133 experiments, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.005 (unpaired t \u2010test). To examine the lipid transport capabilities of ER\u2013LD junctions, we utilized Bodipy\u2010C12 (BPY\u2010C12), a fluorescent fatty acid analog used to monitor cellular fatty acid trafficking in cells (Rambold et al , 2015 ; Ohsaki et al , 2016 ). To this end, we first incubated delipidated cells in the presence of BPY\u2010C12 for 24 h, resulting in the incorporation of BPY\u2010C12 into cellular lipids, mostly phosphatidylcholine and neutral lipids (Fig EV6 A). We then incubated cells with OA for 1\u20132 h to induce LD biogenesis, which was accompanied by the accumulation of BPY\u2010lipids to LDs in both WT and SKO cells (Fig 5 C and D). However, FRAP experiments revealed that the return of BPY to LDs was impaired in SKO cells compared to WT (Figs 5 D and E, and EV6 B) while recovery in ER membranes appeared similar between genotypes (Fig EV6 C). Analogously to HPos, this suggests that BPY\u2010lipids can be incorporated into nascent LDs but cannot reach pre\u2010existing ones. To probe this further, we first induced LD biogenesis with OA for 1 h and then labeled cells with BPY\u2010C12 for 10 min and chased for increasing times in the presence of OA. In WT cells, there was a gradual, clear increase in BPY LD localization and a subsequent decrease in BPY labeling of membranous structures (Fig 5 F and G). In contrast, in SKO cells the probe largely remained in a membranous pattern and the colocalization of BPY with LDs was markedly attenuated (Fig 5 F and G). Figure EV6 Additional information on fatty acid ER\u2013LD trafficking and metabolism In relation to Fig 5 C\u2013E. WT and SKO cells were delipidated for 72 h with the last 24 h in the presence of 1 \u03bcM BPY\u2010C12 to label cellular lipids (pulse). LD biogenesis was induced by incubating cells in the presence of 0.1 mM OA for 2 h (chase). Lipids were extracted, separated on TLC, and imaged. BPY\u2010containing PC (phosphatidylcholine) and NL (neutral lipid) were identified based on migration corresponding with unlabeled lipids. Representative TLC from two experiments with similar results. In relation to Fig 5 E. Cells were incubated with BPY\u2010C12 as in (A). LD biogenesis was induced by incubating cells in the presence of 0.1 mM OA and LipidTox Green for 1\u20132 h. BPY on LDs was bleached and recovery to LDs monitored. The examples shown are from cells incubated with OA for 85 min (upper panel) and 95 min (lower panel). Analysis of BPY\u2010C12 recovery to LDs from FRAP experiments performed as outlined in (B). Additional photobleaching of ER regions was conducted prior to LD biogenesis induction. Data are normalized to both pre\u2010bleach and post\u2010bleach intensities, \u00b1 SEM, n = 22 bleached LDs (three experiments) and 10 ER regions/genotype (two experiments). Also shown are curve fits of the recovery curves. Data for LD recovery are the same as in Fig 5 E. Additional data related to Fig 5 H. Bars: % of alkyne\u2010OA in neutral lipids (TAG and CE) (NL), free fatty acid (FFA), and phosphatidylcholine (PC), normalized to NL in WT pulse (1), \u00b1 SEM, n = 6\u20139, 2\u20133 experiments, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.005 (unpaired t \u2010test, all significant differences indicated in graph). Data for NL are also shown in Fig 5 H. Exemplary TLC plates of alkyne\u2010OA incorporation into cellular lipids in conditions described in Fig 5 H. To compare the rapid flux of non\u2010fluorescent fatty acids to neutral lipids in WT and SKO cells, we employed \u201cclick\u201d chemistry. Alkyne\u2010OA has previously been used to monitor fatty acid flux in mammalian cells and shown to perform similarly as radiolabeled tracers (Thiele et al , 2012 ). We first examined neutral lipid synthesis of WT and SKO cells during early LD biogenesis, incubating delipidated cells with 0.1 mM alkyne\u2010OA for 10 min and chasing for 20 min. Both after the pulse and after the chase, alkyne\u2010OA incorporation into neutral lipids was similar between genotypes (Fig 5 H), arguing that the neutral lipid synthesis machinery of SKO cells is intact during early steps of LD biogenesis. However, when the 10\u2010min alkyne\u2010OA pulse\u2010chase was performed after a 1\u2010h pre\u2010incubation with unlabeled OA to first induce the generation of LDs, the results were different. Both after the pulse and after the chase, there was an impairment of OA incorporation into neutral lipids in SKO cells (Figs 5 H and EV6 D and E). Overall, these data suggest that in SKO cells, initial protein and lipid trafficking to nascent LDs is at least partly preserved and neutral lipid synthesis during early LD assembly is intact. Instead, the subsequent trafficking of cargo between ER and more mature LDs is compromised and accompanied by a neutral lipid synthesis defect. Older LDs of SKO cells display heterogeneous ER connectivity To study the role of seipin on LDs after longer fatty acid exposure, we incubated cells with OA for 20 h. Also under these conditions, seipin\u2010GFP was found at ER\u2013LD contacts, while A212P\u2010seipin\u2010GFP was more frequently absent (Fig 6 A and Appendix Fig S5A\u2013C ). By light and electron microscopy, WT cells were characterized by numerous, relatively homogeneous looking LDs, often in clusters (Fig 6 B\u2013D). In contrast, SKO cells harbored strikingly heterogeneous LDs, with small aggregated as well as supersized LDs, as described (Szymanski et al , 2007 ; Fei et al , 2008 ). In addition, abundant small individual LDs were found throughout the cell (Fig 6 B\u2013D). These small LDs behaved similarly as the newly formed LDs of SKO cells, displaying increased mobility and aberrant trajectories, with a subset moving seemingly independently of the ER (Fig 6 E and F, and Appendix Fig S5E\u2013G ). Instead, the aggregated and supersized LDs were typically immobile ( Appendix Fig S5E and F ). Also under these conditions, by SB\u2010EM, LDs disconnected from the ER were only detected in SKO cells ( Appendix Fig S5H ). Figure 6 Older LD s of SKO cells display heterogeneous ER connectivity A431 WT cells with seipin tagged at its chromosomal locus with sfGFP and stably expressing ER marker plasmid (BFP\u2010KDEL) were delipidated and treated with OA for 20 h, fixed, and stained with LipidTox Red.

Data are normalized to both pre\u2010bleach and post\u2010bleach intensities, \u00b1 SEM, n = 51\u201361 bleached LD areas/genotype, three experiments. We next investigated the localization of endogenous ACSL3 in cells after 20 h of OA loading. In WT cells, ACSL3 was invariably associated with LDs (Fig 6 G and H). In SKO cells, a substantial fraction of the small LDs did not acquire ACSL3, while the large LDs did (Fig 6 G and H). We also studied the localization of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), the final enzyme of TG synthesis that has been shown to localize to LDs to promote their growth (Kuerschner et al , 2008 ; Wilfling et al , 2013 ). Indeed, many large LDs of WT and SKO cells recruited this protein, while most small LDs did not, with no obvious difference between genotypes ( Appendix Fig S5I ). To examine cargo transport at ER\u2013LD junctions at this time point, we performed HPos FRAP experiments. In WT cells, HPos returned efficiently to all LDs analyzed, but in SKO cells, the majority of LDs showed impaired recovery (Fig 6 I and J, and Appendix Fig S6 ). Curiously, some large (> 0.5 \u03bcm in diameter) LDs in SKO cells showed exceptionally rapid HPos recovery (Fig 6 I and J). Overall, these data suggest that the connectivity of LDs to the ER is continuous over time in WT cells. In the absence of seipin, small \u201cnascent\u2010like\u201d LDs with dysfunctional/missing ER contacts are continuously present. In parallel, large LDs of SKO cells display heterogeneous ER connectivity. LDs without ER contacts, impaired ACSL3 targeting and defective fatty acid flux to neutral lipids in BSCL2 patient fibroblasts To assess whether our findings in SKO A431 cells can be reproduced in BSCL2 patient\u2010derived cells, we analyzed LD dynamics and ER\u2013LD relationship in healthy control (control 1 and control 2) and BSCL2 patient\u2010derived primary fibroblasts with homozygous frameshift mutations in seipin (S3 and S5) (Boutet et al , 2009 ). When delipidated fibroblasts were incubated for 1 h with OA to induce LD biogenesis, the BSCL2 patient cells showed aberrant LD morphology, with an abundance of tiny LDs (Fig 7 A), in agreement with previous findings in fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with a different mutation (Szymanski et al , 2007 ) and our observations in A431 SKO cells. Aberrantly large LDs were also detected, especially after prolonged OA incubation ( Appendix Fig S7A ). Interestingly, live cell imaging revealed an almost twofold increase in the mobility of nascent LDs in the cell periphery of BSCL2 patient cells as compared to controls (Fig 7 B and C, and Movie EV9 ). High\u2010resolution live cell imaging of LDs and the ER showed that, similarly to A431 SKO cells, in BSCL2 patient cells a subset of LDs were moving at high velocities and apparently independently of the ER (Fig 7 D and E, and Appendix Fig S7B and C , and Movie EV10 ). In contrast, in control cells even rapidly moving LDs appeared to move along the ER (Fig 7 D and E, and Movie EV10 ). Moreover, analysis of confocal z \u2010stacks of fixed specimen showed that BSCL2 patient cells harbored LDs with no obvious contact with the ER, while this was not observed in control fibroblasts ( Appendix Fig S7D ). We also investigated the targeting of endogenous ACSL3 to LDs. In BSCL2 patient cells, ACSL3 localization was altered in a similar manner as observed in A431 SKO cells (Fig 7 F and G). Finally, in alkyne\u2010OA flux experiments (analogous to the ones in A431 cells), we found no defect in OA incorporation into neutral lipids in delipidated cells. After LD biogenesis induction, control fibroblasts increased OA incorporation into neutral lipids, but BSCL2 cells failed to do so (Fig 7 H). Figure 7 BSCL 2 patient fibroblasts display LD s moving independently of the ER , ACSL 3 mistargeting, and defective fatty acid flux to neutral lipids Two control and BSCL2 fibroblast cell lines were delipidated and treated with OA for 1 h, fixed, and stained with LD540.

Discussion In this study, we found that human seipin is present in discrete foci in the ER and these structures were enriched at ER\u2013LD junctions by immuno\u2010EM, similarly as reported for Ldb16 in yeast (Grippa et al , 2015 ). We estimated the size of these foci to be roughly 40\u201350 nm by antibody detection of fluorescently tagged proteins. This size estimate is roughly in line with that obtained by atomic force microscopy of purified seipin oligomers (Sim et al , 2013 ). It is also possible that several oligomers join into a functional unit at the ER\u2013LD junction. The seipin\u2010GFP foci were mobile in the ER, with LD\u2010associated puncta moving less rapidly than those not associated with LDs. Most nascent LDs harbored only one WT\u2010seipin\u2010GFP punctum that appeared to be stably associated with the LD and moving together with it. Importantly, similar stable association of seipin at ER\u2013LD contacts and dynamic non\u2010LD\u2010associated seipin foci in the ER were observed when human seipin was tagged with GFP at its endogenous genomic locus. This agrees well with recent findings on endogenously tagged seipin in Drosophila cells (Wang et al , 2016 ). Seipin recruitment to ER\u2013LD contacts is a relatively early event during LD biogenesis, as reintroduction of seipin did not rescue protein targeting to pre\u2010existing LDs of seipin\u2010deficient cells. Lipid droplets are considered to maintain a close functional and physical relationship with the ER (Jacquier et al , 2011 ; Wilfling et al , 2013 ), but proteins tethering LDs to the ER have not been characterized. In A431 cells used in this study, all newly formed LDs appeared to be physically linked to the ER via discrete membrane contacts, as judged by ET. Unexpectedly, in SKO cells, a subset (roughly 10%) of LDs was entirely devoid of membrane contacts to the ER. In addition, the persisting ER\u2013LD contacts in SKO cells appeared morphologically abnormal, forming either very narrow and string\u2010like or extensive web\u2010like attachments. These data strongly suggest that seipin is critical for the formation and/or stabilization of normal ER\u2013LD contacts. However, as some LDs in SKO cells appeared extensively surrounded by the ER, seipin is presumably not the only protein responsible for the maintenance of ER\u2013LD contacts. Interestingly, LD detachment from the ER has not been reported in yeast lacking seipin ( Fdl1 \u0394 /Ldb16 \u0394). On the other hand, although we found a subset of LDs wrapped by the ER, we did not observe abnormal proliferations in the ER enwrapping LDs, as described in yeast (Grippa et al , 2015 ; Wolinski et al , 2015 ). This suggests cell type\u2010specific differences in the phenotype(s) of ER\u2013LD contacts in the absence of seipin. We did, however, observe a general widening of ER profiles in SKO cells that had been challenged with OA for 1 h. We speculate that this might reflect the deposition of cargo destined to LDs inside the ER. Indeed, studies in Fdl1 \u0394 yeast have documented increased neutral lipid sequestration in the ER during LD biogenesis (Cartwright et al , 2015 ). Based on our studies of protein and lipid delivery from the ER to LDs, it seems that a large fraction, potentially all, of ER\u2013LD contacts in seipin knockout cells were functionally defective. Another unanticipated observation, possibly reflecting the loss of functional ER contacts in seipin\u2010deficient cells, was the increased mobility of LDs. This was most conspicuous for LDs that appeared not to maintain contacts with the ER, exhibiting rapid, non\u2010directional jerky movements. Importantly, increased and abnormal LD motility in the cell periphery was also observed in BSCL2 patient fibroblasts. It is conceivable that ER contacts limit LD movement, and if lost, LD mobility becomes unrestricted. Interestingly, in seipin\u2010deficient cells also those LDs that appeared to move along the ER often had higher velocities. This points to the possibility that seipin plays a role in immobilizing LDs at distinct sites in the ER. Moreover, the generation of abnormally numerous small LDs suggests that seipin may also act by somehow restricting the number of LD nucleation sites in the ER (Cartwright & Goodman, 2012 ). To better understand this, it will be important to study the functions of non\u2010LD\u2010associated seipin foci. A marked phenotype of seipin\u2010deficient cells upon fatty acid loading is the formation of numerous tiny LDs. By EM, these LDs had a rather uniform diameter of circa 200 nm. This suggests that the initial formation of LDs in the ER does not depend on seipin, but in the absence of seipin, growth of most LDs beyond this size becomes abortive. A similar conclusion was reached by Wang et al ( 2016 ), while our work was under review. Based on our study, one possible explanation for this is the defective recruitment of protein machinery involved in lipid synthesis from the ER to LDs, as indicated by the impaired LD targeting of ACSL3 that should channel fatty acids into nascent LDs and promote their growth (Kassan et al , 2013 ). Moreover, the recruitment of some protein and lipid cargo to forming LDs was initially successful in seipin\u2010deficient cells, as indicated by the targeting of BPY\u2010C12 metabolites and the HPos model peptide to nascent LDs. Yet, based on FRAP studies their recruitment to pre\u2010formed LDs was compromised. Our rapid fatty acid flux experiments strengthened the idea that the initial machinery for triglyceride synthesis in seipin\u2010deficient cells is intact. However, a marked defect in OA incorporation into neutral lipids became manifested if OA was introduced into cells that already exhibited triglyceride stores and LDs. Together, these data imply that nascent LDs need to reach a distinct maturity at which the role of seipin in ER\u2013LD cargo exchange becomes apparent. Lipid droplet biogenesis is considered to be a stepwise process, originating by initial aggregation of neutral lipids inside the ER bilayer (Pol et al , 2014 ). Such initial lenses have so far not been reported in mammalian cells, but are likely to be followed by bigger blister\u2010like structures strengthening membrane curvature changes. The neutral lipid core would grow and induce the structure to bud off from the ER but remain in a dynamic contact with it. Indeed, LDs connected to the ER via what appear to be membrane bridges have been visualized by EM by us and others (Kassan et al , 2013 ; Wilfling et al , 2013 ). Based on our findings, the simplest interpretation is that seipin plays a role in LD biogenesis after the initial LD nucleation, by helping to physically bridge at least a subset of newly formed LDs to the ER (Fig 8 ). By contributing structurally to or otherwise stabilizing the ER\u2013LD contact, seipin may also facilitate the incorporation of protein and lipid cargo into growing LDs. This idea does not rule out other proposed functions of seipin at the ER\u2013LD interphase, such as a scaffolding of proteins important for neutral lipid synthesis (Sim et al , 2013 ; Talukder et al , 2015 ). Figure 8 Schematic illustration of the proposed role of seipin in ER \u2013 LD contacts LD biogenesis is initiated in the ER . Nascent LD s harboring seipin at their ER contact recruit proteins and lipids from the ER to promote LD growth. LD s remain associated with the ER during maturation, allowing continuous cargo exchange between these compartments. In seipin\u2010deficient cells, ER \u2013 LD contacts are morphologically abnormal, either missing, rudimentary, or aberrantly extensive. Most newly formed LD s lack functional contacts with the ER . HP os, a model ER \u2010to\u2010 LD targeting peptide can initially reach LD s but its access to LD s is later perturbed. ACSL 3, a lipid biosynthetic enzyme normally targeted to the LD surface remains in the ER or at ER \u2013 LD junctions. Oleic acid flux into neutral lipids is initially intact but subsequently impaired. In contrast, ADRP , a cytoplasmic coat protein, reaches LD s independently of seipin. Defective ER \u2013 LD contacts result in discontinued cargo exchange and arrested LD maturation, where the majority of LD s fail to grow beyond the diameter of ~200 nm. Importantly, it is increasingly evident that the communication between ER and LDs is bidirectional. Proteins and lipids may also relocate from the LD to the ER (Jacquier et al , 2011 ; Kassan et al , 2013 ; Wilfling et al , 2013 ) and mature LDs may be accessible from the ER luminal side (Mishra et al , 2016 ). The proposal that seipin acts as a diffusion barrier between the two compartments is interesting in this regard (Grippa et al , 2015 ), and potentially compatible with our data. For instance, nascent LDs might need seipin as a diffusion barrier to control their surface phospholipid composition, which would be required for the proper targeting of proteins destined for growing LDs and for the maintenance of their ER contacts. Considering the persistent localization of seipin at ER\u2013LD contacts, it is likely that it also plays a role in the maintenance of more mature LDs. However, at present it is not possible to discriminate between bona fide later role(s) of seipin from secondary effects induced at the earlier step(s) of LD biogenesis. In conclusion, this study reveals a role for seipin in ensuring functional ER\u2013LD contacts of nascent LDs in human cells. How defective ER\u2013LD interactions contribute to the near absence of adipose tissue in human BSCL2 remains open. An interesting observation in this context is that unilocular adipocytes may contain ER\u2010associated micro\u2010LDs that serve as intermediates in the packaging of triglycerides to the unilocular LD (Chu et al , 2014 ). Materials and Methods Cell culture and transfection Human epithelial carcinoma A431 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml each) and L\u2010glutamine (2 mM). Transfections of plasmids (Lipofectamine LTX with PLUS Reagent) and siRNAs (HiPerfect) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control human primary fibroblasts were from Coriell Cell Repositories (GM01650 and GM00323, designated as controls 1 and 2 in this study), and BSCL2 patient fibroblasts S3 and S5 were established from forearm skin biopsies of patients described in Boutet et al ( 2009 ). Fibroblasts were cultured in MEM, with 15% non\u2010heat\u2010inactivated FBS supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and L\u2010glutamine. Primary human fibroblasts were transfected with Amaxa Human Dermal Fibroblasts Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of endogenously tagged seipin\u2010sfGFP Superfolder\u2010GFP (P\u00e9delacq et al , 2006 ) and a 3XGGGGS linker were inserted at the C\u2010terminus of endogenous seipin by CRISPR/Cas9\u2010mediated genome editing (Pinder et al , 2015 ). Briefly, a homology\u2010directed repair template was generated by overlap PCR and transfected into A431 cells together with a vector encoding Cas9, sgRNA targeting the C\u2010terminus of seipin locus, and a puromycin selection marker. Clones were isolated after transient selection with puromycin. See Appendix Fig S4 for details of the constructs. Delipidation, LD induction, and cell fusion Cells were delipidated by culturing in serum\u2010free medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein\u2010deficient serum [LPDS; prepared as described in Goldstein et al ( 1983 )] for 3 days. For experiments involving LD induction, unless otherwise stated, cells were supplemented with 0.2 mM OA [final concentration, OA supplemented in complex with BSA in 8:1 molar ratio prepared in serum\u2010free DMEM as described in H\u00f6ltt\u00e4\u2010Vuori et al ( 2013 )] for indicated times. For cell fusion, cells were first co\u2010plated for 2.5 h. Fusion was induced by adding PEG 1500 (50% w/v) to the cells for 1 min at RT, followed by four washes with PBS. Click\u2010labeling and lipid analysis Alkyne\u2010OA click assay was performed essentially as described in Thiele et al ( 2012 ). Briefly, for A431 cells 1 h prior to alkyne\u2010OA labeling delipidated cells grown in 6\u2010cm dishes were transferred to CO 2 \u2010independent medium containing 5% LPDS only or 5% LPDS and 0.1 mM OA and transferred to 37\u00b0C water bath. Cells were then pulsed for 10 min with 0.1 mM alkyne\u2010OA in 10 mg/ml fatty acid\u2010free BSA medium and collected, or further incubated in chase medium (10% FBS or 0.1 mM OA) for 20 min. For fibroblasts, pulse and chase times were doubled to account for slower alkyne\u2010OA uptake and metabolism, chase medium contained 0.1 mM OA, and incubations were performed at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Lipids were then extracted and the extracts reacted with 3\u2010azido\u20107\u2010hydroxycoumarin in the presence of Cu(I) as in Thiele et al ( 2012 ). After the click reaction, products were separated on standard silica gel TLC plates and the plates developed and imaged as described in Thiele et al ( 2012 ). Densitometric analysis of the fraction of alkyne\u2010OA incorporated into cellular lipids was analyzed from images as percentage of total lane intensity with ImageJ FIJI. Neutral lipid analysis and BPY\u2010C12 incorporation into lipids For analysis of neutral lipid content, lipids were extracted and analyzed by high\u2010performance TLC as described in H\u00f6ltt\u00e4\u2010Vuori et al ( 2012 ). For analysis of BPY\u2010C12 incorporation into cellular lipids, lipids were extracted as described and separated on standard silica gel plates as described (Thiele et al , 2012 ) and visualized using a FLA\u20109000 imager. Statistical analyses The results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM or SD as indicated. Statistical analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel and Prism (GraphPad). Normality of data was assessed with D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test, and parametric or non\u2010parametric tests indicated were used accordingly. F \u2010test was used to assess for variance, and t \u2010tests assuming or not assuming equal variance were used accordingly. P \u2010values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

    "full_text_abstract": "Abstract Seipin is an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane protein implicated in lipid droplet ( LD ) biogenesis and mutated in severe congenital lipodystrophy ( BSCL 2). Here, we show that seipin is stably associated with nascent ER \u2013 LD contacts in human cells, typically via one mobile focal point per LD . Seipin appears critical for such contacts since ER \u2013 LD contacts were completely missing or morphologically aberrant in seipin knockout and BSCL 2 patient cells. In parallel, LD mobility was increased and protein delivery from the ER to LD s to promote LD growth was decreased. Moreover, while growing LD s normally acquire lipid and protein constituents from the ER , this process was compromised in seipin\u2010deficient cells. In the absence of seipin, the initial synthesis of neutral lipids from exogenous fatty acid was normal, but fatty acid incorporation into neutral lipids in cells with pre\u2010existing LD s was impaired. Together, our data suggest that seipin helps to connect newly formed LD s to the ER and that by stabilizing ER \u2013 LD contacts seipin facilitates the incorporation of protein and lipid cargo into growing LD s in human cells."
