  "abstract_text": "3'-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), the direct upstream kinase of Akt, can localize to the nucleus during specific signalling events. The mechanism used for its import into the nucleus, however, remains unresolved as it lacks a canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS). Expression of activated Src kinase in C6 glioblastoma cells promotes the association of tyrosylphosphorylated PDK1 with the NLS-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 as well as the nuclear localization of both proteins. A constitutive nucleo-cytoplasmic SHP-1:PDK1 shuttling complex is supported by several lines of evidence including (i) the distribution of both proteins to similar subcellular compartments following manipulation of the nuclear pore complex, (ii) the nuclear retention of SHP-1 upon overexpression of a PDK1 protein bearing a disrupted nuclear export signal (NES), and (iii) the exclusion of PDK1 from the nucleus upon overexpression of SHP-1 lacking the NLS or following siRNA-mediated knock-down of SHP-1. The latter case results in a perinuclear distribution of PDK1 that corresponds with the distribution of PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate), while a PDK1 protein bearing a mutated PH domain that abrogates PIP3-binding is excluded from the nucleus. Our data suggest that the SHP-1:PDK1 complex is recruited to the nuclear membrane by binding to perinuclear PIP3, whereupon SHP-1 (and its NLS) facilitates active import. Export from the nucleus relies on PDK1 (and its NES). The intact complex contributes to Src kinase-induced, Akt-sensitive podial formation in C6 cells.",
