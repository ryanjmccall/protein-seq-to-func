  "abstract_text": "Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a critical mediator of apoptotic signaling pathways initiated by a variety of death stimuli. Its activity is tightly controlled by various mechanisms such as covalent modification and protein-protein interaction. One of the proteins that control ASK1 function is 14-3-3zeta, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. Here, we report that ASK1 is capable of binding to other isoforms of 14-3-3, suggesting that binding ASK1 is a general property of the 14-3-3 family. In support of this notion, mutational analysis revealed that the ASK1/14-3-3 interaction was mediated by the conserved amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 with some residue selectivity. Functionally, expression of various isoforms of 14-3-3 suppressed ASK1-induced apoptosis. To understand how 14-3-3 controls the ASK1 activity, we examined intracellular localization of ASK1 upon 14-3-3 co-expression. We found that 14-3-3 co-expression is correlated with the translocation of ASK1 from the cytoplasm to a perinuclear localization, likely the ER compartment. Consistent with this notion, ASK1(S967A), a 14-3-3 binding defective mutant of ASK, showed no change in intracellular distribution upon 14-3-3 co-expression. These data support a model that 14-3-3 proteins regulate the proapoptotic function of ASK1 in part by controlling its subcellular distribution.",
