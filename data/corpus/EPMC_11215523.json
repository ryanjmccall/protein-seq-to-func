    "abstract_text": "Though the mitogenic activity of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been well established through classical studies, its mechanism of action was long obscure. Recent identification and cloning of LPA-specific receptors has led to the elucidation of the G-proteins and signaling pathways through which this molecule functions. In addition to its mitogenic properties, recent reports have suggested that LPA may also promote cell survival. This review will summarize the current literature regarding LPA signaling and its role as an antiapoptotic factor.",
