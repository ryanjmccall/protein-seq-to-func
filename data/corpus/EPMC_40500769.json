This impaired differentiation turns into persistent cytopenias and morphologic dysplasia, along with an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [ 1 , 2 ]. Given the clinical heterogeneity and the multiple etiologic factors that drive MDS development and progression, MDS cell lines had arisen as a key resource for modelling the leukemic evolution of MDS and unravel the pathogenic mechanisms behind it. Although up to 31 MDS-derived cell lines have been described in the literature, it has been challenging to identify one that accurately represents this pathology since a substantial part of them were established at the time of AML progression [ 3 ]. The MDS-L cell line is a blastic subline derived from the parental cell line MDS92, which has been proven to be the sole line established during the MDS phase of the disease [ 4 ]. Concretely, it derives from the bone marrow of a 52-year-old male patient with MDS-EB1 (MDS with excess of blasts type 1). MDS92 karyotype was previously reported as 44,XY,-7,-12,-13,del(5)(q13q35),add(14)(p11),add(22)(q13),+mar, together with an NRAS mutation, being both 5q deletion and monosomy 7 key alterations of the MDS condition [ 3 ]. Regarding its predecessor, the MDS-L proliferates in the presence of Interleukin−3 (IL-3) but has lost its differentiation capacity [ 5 ]. According to Tohyama et al. [ 6 ], its main karyotype was 49,XY,+1,der(5)t(5;19),-7,+8,-12,der(13)t(7;13),der(14)t(12;14),der(15)t(15;15),+19,+20,+21,der(22)t(11;22). Subsequent to the initial report, mutations in TP53 , CEBPA and NRAS were detected [ 4 ]. All these characteristics have made MDS-L a useful preclinical tool for the study of the in vitro effects of lenalidomide [ 6 , 7 ], and has enabled the establishment of an MDS xenograft model [ 5 , 8 ]. However, no further studies have delved deeper into the characterization of its genomic complexity, limiting its applicability as an in vitro model for MDS. With the aim of providing a more detailed characterization of the chromosomal alterations and mutational landscape of the MDS-L cell line, we combined the gold standard techniques used in the clinical routine for MDS diagnosis. Structural alterations were defined by integrating conventional G-banding and traditional molecular cytogenetic techniques together with the novel emerging Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) technology. The mutational landscape was defined by targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS). Materials and methods MDS-L cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), streptomycin/penicillin at 10 units each, 292 µg/ml glutamine, 20 µg/ml IL-3 and 10 ng/ml granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Thermo Scientific). For karyotype and Multicolor FISH (M-FISH) analysis, approximately 10 million cells were seeded in 5 ml of growing media and metaphase chromosome spreads were obtained following standard cytogenetic procedures [ 9 ]. Preparations were processed for M-FISH using the 24XCyte Human Multicolor FISH Probe kit (Metasystems GmbH). M-FISH capturing was performed in a Metafer Slide Scanning System (MetaSystems) with a AX10 ZEISS epifluorescence microscope and analyses were performed on the Isis FISH imaging system (MetaSystems). A total of 16 and 8 metaphases were analyzed by G-banding and M-FISH, respectively. For tNGS, OGM and SNP microarray studies, cells in exponential growth were cryopreserved in the same media, without IL-3/GM-CSF, 40% FBS and 10% DMSO. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated from 2 million cryopreserved cells and labeled and processed for analysis following the manufacturer’s protocols (Bionano Genomics Inc., San Diego, CA). DNA molecules were imaged by the Saphyr instrument and genome analysis was performed using the rare variant pipeline from the Bionano Access 1.8 platform, for the detection of aneuploidies, copy number variants (CNV), structural variants and regions of homozygosity (ROH). MDS-L DNA was also analyzed with the ThermoFisher ® CytoScan 750 K microarray for the identification of both CNA and ROH. The same DNA was used to perform tNGS using a custom myeloid panel covering selected exons of 51 associated with MDS disease [ 2 ]. The custom panel was designed following the specifications of KAPA HyperCap Workflow 3.3 (Roche, Basilea, Switzerland). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument following a paired-end 2 × 75 bp reads standard protocol, with a mean coverage of 1000x. Filtering, categorization and interpretation of variants was based on the criteria proposed by the Spanish Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes [ 10 ]. Results Two karyotypically distinct cell populations were detected by conventional G-banding, both showing a complex karyotype and found in the same proportion (8 out of 16 metaphases each). The two populations mainly differed by the presence of 1p arm gain and a derivative chromosome 7 (Fig. 1 A top) or a derivative chromosome 1 formed by the fusion of 1p and 7q arms (Fig. 1 A bottom). The M-FISH technique confirmed the translocations observed in the karyotype and identified the origin of the extra material present in chromosomes 6, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21 and 22 (Fig. 1 A). In this sense, the rearrangements der(1)t(1;7)(q11;q11.2), der(6)t(6;15)(p21.3;q15), der(9)t(9;10)(q34;p11.21), der(13)t(7;13)(p14.3;q14.2), der(15)t(15;15)(p11.2;q22), der(19)t(6;19)(p13;p22), der(21)t(15;21)(q22;p11.2) and der(22)t(11;22)(q13.2;q13.1) were defined (Table 1 ). Finally, it also allowed the detection of the cryptic rearrangement der(7)t(2;7)(q24.3;p21.1) present in only one of the two cell populations (Fig. 1 A top). Fig. 1 Overview of the genomic alterations detected by the multi-techniqueapproach. A) G banding and M-FISH of the two karyotypically distinct cellpopulations. B)Circosplot summarizing all the genomic alterations detected by the combination ofdifferent techniques. Rings are as follows (from outer to inner): chromosomecytobands, ROH regions (yellow), aneuploidies and CNV (gains in blue and lossesin red, alterations smaller than 500 kilobases are shown as dots), intra- andinterchromosomic translocations (green for those detected only by M-FISH, andblue for those detected by both OGM and M-FISH). C) UpSet plot illustrating thenumber of alterations detected exclusively by each technique, as well as thenumber of alterations simultaneously detected by multiple techniques. The combination of OGM and SNP microarrays allowed the detection of aneuploidies in chromosomes 1, 5p, 8q, 19, 20 and 21 previously detected by karyotype, and 43 copy number variants (CNV) ranging from 6 kilobases to 67.1 megabases (Fig. 1 B; Table 1 ). In addition, it facilitated the reevaluation of chromosome 7 status, as multiple losses were detected along the chromosome, but it was not completely lost. M-FISH study suggested that part of the remaining regions of chromosome 7 were in chromosome 13 (Fig. 1 A), an observation that was confirmed by OGM results. Moreover, the precise definition of the breakpoint sites in their genomic context allowed the detection of RB1 gene disruption as a result of t(7;13) rearrangement. The OGM technique detected 54% of the rearrangements identified by M-FISH and karyotyping. The remaining percentage is fully accounted for by rearrangements involving centromeric and telomeric regions, which are areas where OGM coverage is compromised [ 11 ] (Fig. 1 B green lines and Table 1 ). ROH regions were detected in chromosome arms 1q, 5q, 6p, 7q, 8p, 11q, 17p, 19p and 22q (Fig. 1 B). Even so, ROH regions in 17p, 19p and 22q were only detected by SNP array, coinciding with the fact that they were all smaller than 25 megabases (limit of detection of ROH in OGM) (Table 1 ). In addition, ROHs detected by OGM tend to be smaller in size than when detected by SNP microarrays, which might be explained by a mismatch between the regions covered by each technique.

In addition, a frameshift variant of unknown significance was found in TET2 (NM_001127208:c.5701delT:p.Y1902Tfs*6 heterozygous) gene. Two more mutations with a variant allele frequency below the 10% threshold [ 10 , 12 ] were detected in DNMT3A (NM_022552:c.1711delG:p.A571Lfs*80) and SMC1A (NM_006306:c.3337T>C:p.Y1113H) genes and were considered subclonal events. Thus, the integration of data from all techniques enabled the characterization of a multi-hit event in TP53 [ 13 ], as the homozygous mutation detected by NGS is indeed explained by the presence of an ROH in 17p region. In summary, a total of 72 alterations were detected after filtering out artifacts and combining the results found by all the techniques (Fig. 1 C). Of these, only 19 alterations were detected across all the techniques. OGM was the technique that detected the highest number of alterations, including 100% of CNV detected by SNP microarrays (Table 1 ). Furthermore, it identified 9 alterations exclusively, due to the resolution limitations of the other techniques (Fig. 1 C). Alterations detected only by SNP microarrays correspond to ROH. Discussion The multi-technique approach presented in this study has allowed a comprehensive characterization of the MDS-L cell line, addressing a gap in the existing literature regarding its genomic complexity. In this context, the structural alterations der(1)t(1;7)(q11;q11.2), del(1)(q11), der(4)t(4;5)(p16;q11.2), i(5)(p10), der(6)t(6;15)(p21.3;q15), der(7)t(2;7)(q24.3;p21.1), i(8)(q10), der(9)t(9;10)(q34;p11.21), der(19)t(6;19)(p13;p22), i(22)(q10), along with the mutation in TET2 , RB1 gene disruption and the ROH affecting TP53 , have been described here for the first time in the MDS-L cell line. Considering all the chromosomal alterations identified through the multi-technique approach, our final karyotype proposal is as follows: 49,XY,+1,del(1)(q11),der(4)t(4;5)(p16;q11.2),i(5)(p10),der(6)t(6;15)(p21.3;q15),-7,der(7)t(2;7)(q24.3;p21.1),+8,i(8)(q10),der(9)t(9;10)(q34;p11.21),-12,der(12)t(14;12)(p11.2;p11.2),der(13)t(7;13)(p14.3;q14.2),der(15)t(15;15)(p11.2;q22),+19,der(19)t(6;19)(p13;p22),+20,+21,der(21)t(15;21)(q22;p11.2),der(21)t(15;21),der(22)t(11;22)(q13.2;q13.1),i(22)(q10)[8]/ 49,XY,+1,der(1)t(1;7)(q11;q11.2),der(4)t(4;5)(p16;q11.2),i(5)(p10),der(6)t(6;15)(p21.3;q15),-7,+8,i(8)(q10),der(9)t(9;10)(q34;p11.21),12,der(12)t(14;12)(p11.2;p11.2),der(13)t(7;13)(p14.3;q14.2),der(15)t(15;15)(p11.2;q22),+19,der(19)t(6;19)(p13;p22),+20,+21,der(21)t(15;21)(q22;p11.2),der(21)t(15;21),der(22)t(11;22)(q13.2;q13.1),i(22)(q10)[8]. Furthermore, the combination of conventional cytogenetics and molecular techniques has proven to be an efficient strategy, enabling the detection of a higher number of alterations than any of the techniques could individually. In this sense, the combination of SNP microarrays and OGM yielded the best results, as it enabled the evaluation of both chromosomal rearrangements and small CNVs (Fig. 1 C). Even though, OGM proved to be the most effective technique, capable of detecting everything from small CNVs to chromosomal rearrangements, thereby showcasing its potential for routine application in MDS diagnosis. Finally, our findings confirm that the MDS-L cell line is a valuable model for MDS in vitro studies, as it exhibits key genetic alterations commonly associated with the disease, such as +1q, ROH 5q, del(7q), ROH 7q, +8q, ROH 11q, del(12p), +19, +20, and +22. Moreover, we have identified a multi-hit TP53 event, further underscoring the relevance of this cell line for researchers focused on studying this specific MDS subtype.

  "plain_text": "Among the human leukemia cell lines described in the literature, only the MDS-L cell line has been definitively established from a patient during the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) phase of the disease. However, the limited studies on its genomic complexity have restricted its applicability as an in vitro model for MDS. Here, we aimed to better characterize the chromosomal and genetic alterations of MDS-L. A comprehensive approach was employed combining conventional G banding, multicolor FISH (M-FISH), SNP arrays with the novel Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) technology. In addition, the mutational landscape was defined using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). G-banding revealed two karyotypically distinct cell populations, both exhibiting complex karyotypes. Using G-banding and OGM, we identified previously undescribed structural alterations, including der(1)t(1;7)(q11;q11.2), del(1)(q11), der(4)t(4;5)(p16;q11.2), i(5)(p10), der(6)t(6;15)(p21.3;q15), i(8)(q10), der(9)t(9;10)(q34;p11.21), der(19)t(6;19)(p13;p22) and i(22)(q10). Both OGM and SNP microarray analyses detected multiple copy number variants and regions of homozygosity. Chromosome breakpoints were precisely defined by OGM, allowing the identification of gene disruption events. Moreover, M-FISH technique validated the origins of additional chromosomal material observed in the karyotype, identified cryptic rearrangements, and distinguished the two clonal populations within the cell line. Finally, NGS revealed mutations in CEBPA , NRAS , TET2 and TP53 genes associated with MDS pathology. This multi-technique approach has enabled a precise characterization of the MDS-L cell line’s genomic complexity, highlighting the unique contributions of each technique in uncovering various genetic alterations and establishing a valuable resource for mechanistic studies and pre-clinical drug development."
