Abstract Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as cellular hubs to orchestrate signaling pathways that regulate metabolism, redox homeostasis, and cell fate decisions. Recent research revealed a role of mitochondria also in innate immune signaling; however, the mechanisms of how mitochondria affect signal transduction are poorly understood. Here, we show that the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway activated by TNF employs mitochondria as a platform for signal amplification and shuttling of activated NF\u2010\u03baB to the nucleus. TNF treatment induces the recruitment of HOIP, the catalytic component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), and its substrate NEMO to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where M1\u2010 and K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains are generated. NF\u2010\u03baB is locally activated and transported to the nucleus by mitochondria, leading to an increase in mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites in a HOIP\u2010dependent manner. Notably, TNF\u2010induced stabilization of the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 furthermore contributes to signal amplification by antagonizing the M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific deubiquitinase OTULIN. Overall, our study reveals a role for mitochondria in amplifying TNF\u2010mediated NF\u2010\u03baB activation, both serving as a signaling platform, as well as a transport mode for activated NF\u2010\u03baB to the nuclear. TNF induces remodeling of the outer mitochondrial membrane by assembling an NF\u2010\u03baB signaling platform that facilitates nuclear translocation of activated NF\u2010\u03baB.

Increasing evidence implicates mitochondria in innate immune signaling, illustrating that mitochondria have been co\u2010opted by eukaryotic cells to react to cellular damage and to promote efficient immune responses. For example, invading pathogens expose pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral RNA, which is recognized by cytoplasmic RLRs (retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I\u2010like receptors). Binding of viral RNA to RLRs induces a conformational change, allowing their recruitment to the mitochondrial RLR adaptor protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein). Subsequent multimerization of MAVS at mitochondria results in the activation of the transcription factors IRF (interferon\u2010regulatory factor) 3, IRF7, and NF\u2010\u03baB (nuclear factor\u2010kappaB), which regulate the expression of type 1 interferons and proinflammatory cytokines (Seth et al , 2005 ; Ablasser & Hur, 2020 ; Rehwinkel & Gack, 2020 ; Chowdhury et al , 2022 ). NF\u2010\u03baB is activated in several innate immune paradigms and is well known for its role in pathological conditions, where prolonged or profuse NF\u2010\u03baB activation in reactive immune or glial cells causes inflammation. However, NF\u2010\u03baB has important physiological functions in most\u2014if not all\u2014cell types. In the nervous system, NF\u2010\u03baB maintains neuronal viability and regulates synaptic plasticity (Meffert et al , 2003 ; O'Riordan et al , 2006 ; Salles et al , 2015 ; Neidl et al , 2016 ; Dresselhaus et al , 2018 ). Constitutive NF\u2010\u03baB activation by para\u2010 or autocrine loops is required for neuronal survival, and stress\u2010induced transient NF\u2010\u03baB activation confers protection from various neurotoxic insults (Blondeau et al , 2001 ; Bhakar et al , 2002 ). Accordingly, TNF has been identified as a neuroprotective cytokine that prevents neuronal damage under various stress conditions (Cheng et al , 1994 ; Turrin & Rivest, 2006 ). Although TNF can induce apoptotic or necroptotic cell death in certain pathological conditions, it usually protects from cell death. Engagement of TNF with its receptor TNFR1 at the plasma membrane results in the formation of signaling complex I that activates the transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB (typically p65/p50 heterodimers) in a tightly regulated manner, involving multiple phosphorylation and ubiquitination events (Hayden & Ghosh, 2014 ; Brenner et al , 2015 ; Annibaldi & Meier, 2018 ; Varfolomeev & Vucic, 2018 ). A crucial step in the activation process is the ubiquitination of NEMO (NF\u2010\u03baB essential modulator) by HOIP, the catalytic component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), and binding of NEMO to linear ubiquitin chains by its UBAN (ubiquitin\u2010binding domain in ABIN and NEMO) domain (Haas et al , 2009 ; Rahighi et al , 2009 ; Tokunaga et al , 2009 ; Fujita et al , 2014 ). These events induce a conformational change and oligomerization of NEMO, activating the associated kinases IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2. IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 phosphorylates the NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1, which is subsequently modified by K48\u2010linked ubiquitin chains and degraded by the proteasome. NF\u2010\u03baB heterodimers, liberated from their inhibitory binding to I\u03baB\u03b1, are then translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they increase the expression of anti\u2010apoptotic proteins or proinflammatory cytokines in a cell type\u2010 and context\u2010specific manner. We have previously shown that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin depends on this pathway to protect from stress\u2010induced neuronal cell death (Henn et al , 2007 ; Muller\u2010Rischart et al , 2013 ). Parkin modifies NEMO with K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains and facilitates subsequent M1\u2010linked ubiquitination of NEMO by HOIP, supporting the concept that linear ubiquitin chains are preferentially assembled as heterotypic K63/M1\u2010linked chains in innate immune signaling pathways (Emmerich et al , 2013 , 2016 ; Fiil et al , 2013 ; Hrdinka et al , 2016 ; Cohen & Strickson, 2017 ). Notably, in the absence of either HOIP or NEMO, Parkin cannot prevent stress\u2010induced cell death (Muller\u2010Rischart et al , 2013 ). Linear or M1\u2010linked ubiquitination is characterized by the head\u2010to\u2010tail linkage of ubiquitin molecules via the C\u2010terminal carboxyl group of the donor ubiquitin and the N\u2010terminal methionine of the acceptor ubiquitin (Kirisako et al , 2006 ; Dittmar & Winklhofer, 2019 ; Spit et al , 2019 ; Oikawa et al , 2020 ; Fiil & Gyrd\u2010Hansen, 2021 ; Fuseya & Iwai, 2021 ; Jahan et al , 2021 ; Shibata & Komander, 2022 ; Tokunaga & Ikeda, 2022 ). Formation and disassembly of linear ubiquitin chains are highly specific processes. HOIP is the only E3 ubiquitin ligase that generates linear ubiquitin chains, whereas OTULIN is the only deubiquitinase that exclusively hydrolyses linear ubiquitin chains (Keusekotten et al , 2013 ; Rivkin et al , 2013 ; Lork et al , 2017 ; Verboom et al , 2021 ; Weinelt & van Wijk, 2021 ). Thus, M1\u2010linked ubiquitination can be studied with unique specificity, in contrast to other types of ubiquitination. Mass spectrometry data on TNF\u2010induced signaling networks and the interactive profile of HOIP and OTULIN directed our interest toward mitochondria (Wagner et al , 2016 ; Kupka et al , 2016a ; Stangl et al , 2019 ). Here we show that TNF induces remodeling of the outer mitochondrial membrane by assembling an NF\u2010\u03baB signaling platform that facilitates nuclear translocation of activated NF\u2010\u03baB. HOIP plays a crucial role in this process by generating M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains and stabilizing the mitochondrial kinase PINK1, which contributes to NF\u2010\u03baB signal amplification through the phosphorylation of ubiquitin. Results TNF induces recruitment of LUBAC and the assembly of linear ubiquitin chains at mitochondria To get insight into the subcellular localization of OTULIN and its interactive profile, we performed co\u2010immunoprecipitation of HA\u2010tagged OTULIN expressed in HEK293T cells coupled to mass spectrometry. Strict filtering criteria were applied in two independent experiments, including only proteins, which were detected by at least two unique peptides that were not present in the negative controls. By this approach, 59 potential OTULIN\u2010interacting proteins were identified (Appendix Fig S1 A). An analysis of the subcellular localization of OTULIN\u2010interacting proteins indicated several mitochondrial proteins (Appendix Fig S1 B), consistent with interactors screens previously performed with OTULIN and HOIP (Kupka et al , 2016a ; Stangl et al , 2019 ). Moreover, mitochondrial proteins were found in a study on proteome\u2010wide dynamics of phosphorylation and ubiquitination in TNF\u2010induced signaling (Wagner et al , 2016 ). These findings prompted us to explore a possible mitochondrial localization of OTULIN and HOIP. Mitochondria from HEK293T cells were isolated and purified by subcellular fractionation using differential centrifugation followed by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation (Fig EV1A and B ). Immunoblotting of purified mitochondrial fractions revealed that a small fraction of both OTULIN and HOIP co\u2010purified with mitochondria (Fig 1A ). We wondered whether OTULIN antagonizes M1\u2010ubiquitination at mitochondria and therefore silenced OTULIN expression by RNA interference. Immunoblotting of mitochondrial fractions using the M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific antibodies 1E3 or 1F11/3F5/Y102L (Matsumoto et al , 2012 ) revealed a strong M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010positive signal at mitochondria isolated from OTULIN\u2010silenced cells, indicating that OTULIN regulates mitochondrial M1\u2010ubiquitination (Fig 1A and B ). Based on the fact that TNF activates LUBAC (Haas et al , 2009 ; Rahighi et al , 2009 ; Tokunaga et al , 2009 ) and the identification of mitochondrial proteins in the proteome analysis of TNF signaling (Wagner et al , 2016 ), we were wondering whether TNF triggers linear ubiquitin chain formation at mitochondria. M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains were detected 15 min after TNF treatment at mitochondria isolated from various cell types, such as HEK293T, HeLa, SH\u2010SY5Y cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig 1A\u2013C ). TNF\u2010induced mitochondrial M1\u2010ubiquitination was not observed in HOIP CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) cells, confirming HOIP\u2010dependent linear ubiquitination (Fig 1D ). Co\u2010localization of M1\u2010linked ubiquitin with mitochondria after TNF treatment was also seen by immunocytochemistry followed by super\u2010resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR\u2010SIM) (Fig 1E ). Consistent with an increase in mitochondrial M1\u2010ubiquitination, the abundance of all three LUBAC components, HOIP, HOIL\u20101L, and SHARPIN, was increased at mitochondria after TNF treatment (Fig 1F ). Immunoblotting of mitochondrial fractions showed that M1\u2010ubiquitination at mitochondria is a fast and transient response with maximum intensity after 15 min, which is paralleled by an increase in K63\u2010ubiquitination (Fig 1G ). This is in line with the observation that linear ubiquitin chains are preferentially assembled as heterotypic K63/M1\u2010linked chains (Emmerich et al , 2013 , 2016 ; Fiil et al , 2013 ; Hrdinka et al , 2016 ; Cohen & Strickson, 2017 ). Figure 1 TNF induces M1\u2010linked ubiquitination at mitochondria A, B A fraction of OTULIN is localized at mitochondria where it suppresses M1\u2010linked ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with control or OTULIN siRNA. Cells were harvested 72 h (A) or 48 h (B) after transfection or 15 min after TNF treatment (25 ng/ml). Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation and purified by ultracentrifugation using an OptiPrep\u2122 density gradient. 38% (A) or 20% (B) of the mitochondrial fractions and 2% (A, B) of whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the antibodies indicated.

TNF stabilizes PINK1 at mitochondria Next, we addressed the functional consequences of TNF\u2010induced mitochondrial ubiquitination. Ubiquitination of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins has been linked to a mitochondrial quality control pathway, resulting in the clearance of mitochondria by mitophagy (Nguyen et al , 2016 ; Whitworth & Pallanck, 2017 ; Harper et al , 2018 ; Pickles et al , 2018 ; Montava\u2010Garriga & Ganley, 2020 ; Goodall et al , 2022 ). In this pathway, depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane leads to an import arrest and stabilization of the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane. PINK1 is then activated by autophosphorylation and phosphorylates ubiquitin and the ubiquitin\u2010like domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin at serine 65, thereby activating Parkin (Gan et al , 2022 ; Kakade et al , 2022 ; Rasool et al , 2022 ; Sauve et al , 2022 ). Parkin\u2010mediated ubiquitination of outer membrane proteins recruits the autophagic machinery to eliminate damaged mitochondria. When the mitochondrial membrane potential is intact, full\u2010length PINK1 is imported by the translocases of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, the TOM and TIM23 complexes, and then PINK1 is processed to a 60 kDa intermediate species by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) in the matrix. Subsequently, the presenilin\u2010associated rhomboid\u2010like protein (PARL) and presumably other proteases in the inner membrane generate a 52\u2010kDa mature PINK1 fragment (Fig EV1C and D ) (Whitworth et al , 2008 ; Jin et al , 2010 ; Deas et al , 2011 ; Meissner et al , 2011 ; Shi et al , 2011 ; Greene et al , 2012 ). Proteolytically processed PINK1 is retro\u2010translocated to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Yamano & Youle, 2013 ; Liu et al , 2017 ). Whereas nonimported full\u2010length PINK1 has been linked to mitophagy induction, little is known about the function of mature PINK1 and the conditions that increase its abundance. The artificial tethering of unbranched linear ubiquitin chains to the mitochondrial outer membrane was shown to induce mitophagy (Yamano et al , 2020 ), we therefore tested whether mitochondrial M1\u2010ubiquitination induced by TNF has an impact on mitophagy. We first compared the relative amounts of PINK1 species in untreated, TNF\u2010stimulated, and CCCP (carbonyl cyanide 3\u2010chlorophenylhydrazone)\u2010treated cells. As expected, dissipation of the proton\u2010motive force across the mitochondrial inner membrane by CCCP (10 \u03bcM, 90 min) stabilized the unprocessed 63 kDa PINK1 species due to an impeded mitochondrial import. Upon 15 min TNF treatment, we observed a small but significant increase in PINK1 abundance (Fig 2A and B ). Interestingly, M1\u2010ubiquitination at mitochondria induced by TNF treatment or OTULIN silencing also increased the processed PINK1 species (Fig 2A ). TNF\u2010induced PINK1 stabilization was accompanied by a slight increase in p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin and p\u2010S65\u2010Parkin signal intensities (Fig 2B ). A kinetic analysis of TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester) fluorescence in TNF\u2010treated cells indicated a mild transient increase in the membrane potential between 15 and 60 min (Fig EV2A ), revealing that PINK1 was not stabilized by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential in TNF\u2010treated cells. Consistent with this result, TNF\u2010induced PINK1 stabilization at mitochondria did not induce mitophagy. Quantitative assessment of mitophagy by flow cytometry using the fluorescent reporter mt\u2010mKeima did not reveal changes in mitophagic activity induced by TNF treatment up to 16 h (Figs 2C and EV2C ). Moreover, mitophagy was not affected by OTULIN silencing or overexpression, suggesting that M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains do not regulate mitophagy (Fig EV2C\u2013E ), in line with proteomic ubiquitin profiling (Ordureau et al , 2014 , 2018 ). Figure 2 PINK1 is stabilized at mitochondria by LUBAC\u2010mediated ubiquitination A, B PINK1 is stabilized by TNF treatment. HEK293T cells were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml, 15 min) or CCCP (10 \u03bcM, 90 min) before harvesting or incubated with OTULIN\u2010specific siRNA for 48 h (A). Purified mitochondrial fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. Quantification of PINK1\u2010specific signals normalized to TIM23 is shown in the right panel.

C TNF\u2010induced PINK1 stabilization does not induce mitophagy. HeLa cells expressing mt\u2010mKeima were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml) for 30 min or 16 h.

V5\u2010tagged\u2010PINK1 immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected HEK293T cells via the V5 tag was incubated with recombinant mouse Ube1, UBE2L3, C\u2010terminal HOIP, and ubiquitin for in vitro ubiquitination. The samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting using V5 antibodies. F Endogenous PINK1 is modified with M1\u2010ubiquitin chains after TNF treatment. HEK293T cells were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml, 15 min), then endogenous PINK1 was immunoprecipitated from mitochondrial fractions. Cells mildly overexpressing PINK1\u2010V5 were also included (lanes 4, 5, 8), to make sure that the immunoreactive bands seen for endogenous PINK1 indeed correspond to PINK1. As a control for the presence of M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains, immunoprecipitated PINK1 was treated with recombinant OTULIN. As controls for the specificity of the immunoprecipitation, beads only (lanes 6\u20138) and beads plus IgG (lane 9) were included. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against PINK1, M1\u2010ubiquitin, and phosphorylated ubiquitin. For immunoprecipitation of overexpressed PINK1, only 50% of cells were used in comparison to the immunoprecipitation of endogenous PINK1. Source data are available online for this figure.

It has been reported previously that the mature 52\u2010kDa PINK1 species is stabilized by K63\u2010linked ubiquitination induced by NF\u2010\u03baB pathway activation (Lim et al , 2015 ). We therefore wondered whether PINK1 is a target for linear ubiquitination. Co\u2010immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that PINK1 interacts with HOIP (Fig EV3A\u2013D ). To map the domains of HOIP mediating this interaction, we employed transiently transfected cells. V5\u2010tagged PINK1 co\u2010purified with full\u2010length HOIP and the N\u2010terminal part of HOIP (aa 1\u2013697), but not with the C\u2010terminal part of HOIP (aa 697\u20131,072) (Fig EV3A and B ). We then tested different HOIP constructs lacking N\u2010terminal domains to more precisely define the region of HOIP that mediates the interaction with PINK1. PINK1 co\u2010immunoprecipitated only with the 1\u2013697 aa HOIP construct and to a lesser extent with the 1\u2013475 aa construct, which lacks the UBA domain, suggesting that the UBA domain directly or indirectly contributes to the interaction of HOIP with PINK1 (Fig EV3C and D ). Of note, immunoblotting of cellular lysates indicated that PINK1 abundance was increased in the presence of either full\u2010length HOIP or N\u2010terminal HOIP (1\u2013697 aa), suggesting that complex formation contributes to PINK1 stabilization (Fig EV3B and D , input). In support of PINK1 interacting with endogenous HOIP, both proteins were detected in the 450\u2013720 kDa fractions (corresponding to the size of LUBAC) upon size\u2010exclusion chromatography of cellular lysates (Fig EV3E ). In the next step, PINK1 ubiquitination was analyzed in cells overexpressing HOIP and HOIL\u20101 to increase LUBAC activity. The cells were harvested under denaturing conditions and then PINK1 was affinity\u2010purified by its V5 tag and subjected to immunoblotting using ubiquitin antibodies. A strong ubiquitin\u2010positive signal in the higher molecular range occurred upon increased expression of HOIP and HOIL\u20101, which was not present in cells overexpressing OTULIN, confirming a linear ubiquitin chain topology (Fig 2D ). Compared with wildtype HOIP, only a weak ubiquitin\u2010positive signal was seen in cells overexpressing catalytically inactive HOIP C885A (Fig 2D ), which can be explained by the ability of co\u2010expressed HOIL\u20101L to increase endogenous LUBAC activity. An in vitro ubiquitination assay using catalytically active recombinant HOIP and PINK1 immunoprecipitated from cells also supported the notion that HOIP can ubiquitinate PINK1 (Fig 2E ). We then tested for ubiquitination of endogenous PINK1 after TNF treatment. PINK1 was immunoprecipitated from untreated or TNF\u2010treated cells and analyzed by immunoblotting using PINK1\u2010, M1\u2010ubiquitin, and p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific antibodies. Increased signal intensities were observed in the high molecular weight range in TNF\u2010treated cells, which disappeared when the cell lysates were treated with recombinant OTULIN (Fig 2F ). In conclusion, TNF signaling induces recruitment of LUBAC to mitochondria, where PINK1 is stabilized by complex formation and ubiquitination.

Twenty\u2010four hours after transfection cells were lysed under native conditions and subjected to immunoprecipitation using HA antibodies. Immunopurified proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using V5 antibodies to detect PINK1. D The UBA domain enhances the interaction between HOIP and PINK1. HEK293T cells were analyzed as described in B. E PINK1 co\u2010elutes with HOIP in cellular lysates. HEK293T cells expressing V5\u2010tagged PINK1 were lysed, and soluble proteins were separated by size\u2010exclusion chromatography. Fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against HOIP and V5. F PINK1 phosphorylates M1\u2010linked tetra\u2010ubiquitin in vitro . M1\u2010linked tetra\u2010ubiquitin was incubated with or without recombinant tcPINK1 in kinase buffer for 48 h. The samples were analyzed by Phos\u2010tag\u2122 SDS\u2013PAGE and immunoblotting using ubiquitin antibodies. G The efficiency of OTULIN to hydrolyze M1\u2010linked ubiquitin is decreased in the presence of PINK1. Recombinant M1\u2010linked tetra\u2010ubiquitin was incubated with or without recombinant Tribolium castaneum tcPINK1 for 48 h. Then, recombinant OTULIN was added for the indicated time. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using ubiquitin antibodies. PINK1 counteracts OTULIN activity at mitochondria by phosphorylating M1 \u2010linked ubiquitin chains What could be the functional consequence of PINK1 stabilization at the mitochondrial outer membrane? PINK1\u2010mediated phosphorylation of ubiquitin alters the structure and surface properties of ubiquitin and thereby can affect the assembly and disassembly of polyubiquitin chains (Wauer et al , 2015 ). It has been shown previously in vitro that M1\u2010linked tetra\u2010ubiquitin is less efficiently hydrolyzed by OTULIN in the presence of PINK1 (Wauer et al , 2015 ). We confirmed these results (Fig EV3F and G ) and tested whether PINK1 impairs OTULIN activity also in cells. Proteins modified by linear polyubiquitin chains were affinity\u2010purified using the recombinant UBAN domain of NEMO (Komander et al , 2009 ; Rahighi et al , 2009 ; Hadian et al , 2011 ; Muller\u2010Rischart et al , 2013 ), which shows a 100\u2010fold higher affinity for M1\u2010linked than for K63\u2010linked ubiquitin (Lo et al , 2009 ; Rahighi et al , 2009 ), and then analyzed by immunoblotting using M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific antibodies. The M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010positive signals in extracts prepared from cells overexpressing HOIP and HOIL\u20101L were abolished by co\u2010expression of wildtype OTULIN (Fig 3A , lanes 1 and 4) but not by the inactive OTULIN variant W96A (Fig 3A , lane 6). Co\u2010expression of PINK1 increased M1\u2010ubiquitination induced by HOIP and HOIL\u20101L (Fig 3A , lanes 1 and 2) and partially restored M1\u2010ubiquitination in cells co\u2010expressing wildtype OTULIN (Fig 3A , lanes 3 and 4). These results suggested that also in cells PINK1 can counteract the efficiency of OTULIN to hydrolyze M1\u2010linked polyubiquitin chains. Figure 3 PINK1 stabilizes M1\u2010linked ubiquitin by phosphorylation and counteracts OTULIN activity PINK1 antagonizes OTULIN activity in cells. HEK293T cells expressing HOIP and HOIL\u20101L were transfected with PINK1, WT OTULIN, or the inactive OTULIN mutant W96A, as indicated. The cells were lysed 24 h later under denaturing conditions, and lysates were subjected to affinity purification using the Strep\u2010tagged UBAN domain of NEMO to enrich proteins modified with M1\u2010linked ubiquitin. Proteins affinity\u2010purified by Strep\u2010Tactin beads were immunoblotted against ubiquitin. Catalytically active PINK1 increases p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin at mitochondria. HEK293T cells were transfected with wildtype PINK1 or kinase\u2010dead (K/D) PINK1. Forty\u2010eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml, 15 min) and lysed. Purified mitochondrial fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin, PINK1, and VDAC (loading control). The TNF\u2010induced increase in p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin is abolished in PINK1\u2010deficient cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with control or PINK1\u2010specific siRNA and treated with TNF (25 ng/ml, 15 min) or CCCP (10 \u03bcM, 90 min) 48 h after transfection. The whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. TNF\u2010induced M1\u2010ubiquitination is reduced in PINK1\u2010deficient cells. WT and PINK1\u2010KO MEFs were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml, 15 min) and then harvested. Purified mitochondrial fractions were subjected to affinity purification using the Strep\u2010tagged UBAN domain, as described in (A), followed by immunoblotting using M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific antibodies, Strep\u2010Tactin conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (to control the UBAN pulldown efficiency), and TIM23 (input control). Quantification of the M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010positive signal intensities is shown in the lower panel. Data represent the mean values with standard deviations of three independent experiments; n.s., not significant, *** P < 0.001. A two\u2010way ANOVA test was used to analyze statistical significance. Source data are available online for this figure. Prompted by these findings, we wondered whether PINK1 increases TNF\u2010induced M1\u2010ubiquitination at mitochondria by phosphorylating ubiquitin. Increased expression of wildtype PINK1 but not kinase\u2010dead (K/D) PINK1 increased p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin in the mitochondrial fraction after TNF treatment (Fig 3B ), whereas in cells silenced for PINK1 expression TNF did not increase p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin (Fig 3C ). In favor of a role of PINK1 in stabilizing M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains, the TNF\u2010induced M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific signal was significantly reduced in MEFs from PINK1\u2010KO mice (Fig 3D ). Mitochondrial M1 \u2010ubiquitination protects from apoptosis Our data so far revealed that TNF increases M1\u2010linked ubiquitination at mitochondria and stabilizes PINK1 without inducing mitophagy. Based on the fact that both TNF and PINK1 have anti\u2010apoptotic functions, we were wondering whether M1\u2010ubiquitination at mitochondria protects from cell death. TNF induces the increased expression of anti\u2010apoptotic proteins through the formation of complex I at the TNFR1 and activation of the transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB (Hayden & Ghosh, 2014 ; Brenner et al , 2015 ; Kupka et al , 2016b ). We hypothesized that the fast TNF\u2010induced increase in mitochondrial ubiquitination protects mitochondria from apoptosis before transcriptional reprogramming by NF\u2010\u03baB takes effect. To address this possibility experimentally, we exposed cells to a short proapoptotic stimulus with or without TNF pretreatment for 15 min. Apoptotic cell death was assessed by mitochondrial Bax recruitment, cytochrome c release, caspase\u20103 activation, and ultrastructural analysis of cristae morphology. Bax was efficiently recruited to mitochondria within 1 h of staurosporine (STS) treatment, as detected by immunoblotting of purified mitochondria (Fig 4A ). When STS was applied 15 min after TNF pretreatment, the amount of mitochondrial Bax was significantly reduced (Fig 4A ). Likewise, STS\u2010induced cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm was decreased by the TNF pretreatment (Fig 4B ). Electron microscopy revealed that TNF prevents the STS\u2010induced reduction in cristae abundance per mitochondrial area and cristae length per mitochondria (Fig 4C and D ). Moreover, TNF significantly reduced the number of STS\u2010treated cells with activated caspase\u20103 (Fig 4E ). This effect was not compromised in the presence of the NF\u2010\u03baB super\u2010repressor I\u03baB\u03b1 (serines 32 and 36 replaced by alanines), which blocks nuclear translocation of the NF\u2010\u03baB subunit p65 and thus NF\u2010\u03baB transcriptional activity (Sun et al , 1996 ; Appendix Fig S2A and B ), indicating that the fast protective effect of TNF was not mediated by NF\u2010\u03baB activation (Fig 4E ). Notably, both HOIP and PINK1 were required for the protective effect of TNF pretreatment, since in cells silenced for HOIP or PINK1 expression, TNF was not able to reduce STS\u2010induced cytochrome c release (Fig 4F and G ). We concluded that the TNF\u2010induced assembly of M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains by HOIP and their phosphorylation by PINK1 interferes with the insertion of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby preventing apoptotic cell death. To check for mitochondrial fitness, we also analyzed cellular bioenergetics in response to TNF treatment and observed a transient increase in maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP production (Fig EV4A\u2013C ), suggesting that TNF at least transiently enhances the cellular energy metabolism. Figure 4 M1\u2010ubiquitination at mitochondria protects from apoptosis A STS\u2010induced mitochondrial Bax recruitment is reduced by TNF. HeLa cells were treated with STS (1 \u03bcM, 1 h) with or without a 15 min pretreatment with TNF (25 ng/ml) and then harvested.

A signaling platform for TNF \u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB activation is assembled at mitochondria Why is mitochondrial fitness and protection fostered in the early phases of TNF signaling? Though the fast TNF\u2010mediated protection of mitochondria from apoptosis was NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010independent, we observed an increased abundance of NEMO, p65, and phosphorylated p65 (p65) at mitochondria after 15 min TNF treatment (Fig 5A ). We therefore speculated that mitochondrial M1\u2010ubiquitination contributes to TNF signal amplification and facilitates transmission of the signal to the nucleus. To confirm our data based on mitochondrial purification and immunoblotting, we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA). In situ PLA using anti\u2010TOM20 and anti\u2010phospho\u2010S536\u2010p65 (p\u2010p65) antibodies revealed the presence of p\u2010p65 at mitochondria and an increased abundance upon TNF treatment (Fig 5B and C ). Next, we tested whether PINK1 has a role in mitochondrial NF\u2010\u03baB pathway activation. TNF\u2010induced nuclear translocation of p65 was significantly decreased in cells silenced for PINK1 expression. This phenotype was rescued by wildtype PINK1 but not by the catalytically inactive PINK1\u2010K/D mutant (Fig 6A ). Moreover, luciferase reporter assays indicated that basal and TNF\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent transcription is reduced in cells silenced for PINK1 expression (Fig EV4D ), in line with earlier findings (Sha et al , 2010 ). NEMO is a highly relevant substrate of HOIP in NF\u2010\u03baB pathway activation, and we and others previously found that Parkin modifies NEMO with K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains (Henn et al , 2007 ; Sha et al , 2010 ; Van Humbeeck et al , 2011 ; Muller\u2010Rischart et al , 2013 ). We therefore explored the possibility that PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitinated NEMO. In cells expressing wildtype PINK1, the p\u2010S65\u2010ubiquitin signal was strongly enhanced on NEMO affinity\u2010purified from cell lysates, whereas no signal was seen when catalytically inactive PINK1\u2010K/D was expressed (Fig 6B ). Supporting the physiological relevance of endogenous PINK1, TNF\u2010induced M1\u2010ubiquitination of NEMO was reduced in PINK1\u2010deficient cells (Fig 6C ). Taken together, catalytically active PINK1 promotes NF\u2010\u03baB activation, most likely by stabilizing M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains on LUBAC substrates, such as NEMO, through phosphorylation. Figure 6 PINK1 promotes NF\u2010\u03baB activation and modulates NEMO ubiquitination Nuclear translocation of p65 is impaired in cells silenced for PINK1 expression. SH\u2010SY5Y cells were transfected with control or PINK1\u2010specific siRNAs. For rescue experiments, cells were co\u2010transfected with wildtype PINK1, PINK1\u039477, or kinase\u2010dead PINK1\u2010K/D.

TNF promotes transport of p65 to the nucleus and increases mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites What could be the advantage of assembling a signaling platform at mitochondria? First, the mitochondrial network provides a large surface area for signal amplification. Second and possibly even more relevant, mitochondria are highly dynamic and mobile organelles that engage in physical and functional interactions with other organelles and the plasma membrane (Scorrano et al , 2019 ; Giacomello et al , 2020 ; Harper et al , 2020 ; Prinz et al , 2020 ). We therefore wondered whether mitochondria facilitate the transport of activated NF\u2010\u03baB components to the nucleus. First, we followed up on the motility of mitochondria in SH\u2010SY5Y cells upon TNF stimulation by life cell imaging and observed a decrease in the distance between peripheral mitochondria and the nucleus within 15 min of TNF treatment (Fig 7A ; Movie EV1 ). Encouraged by this observation, we tested whether mitochondrial motility affects the nuclear translocation of p65 upon TNF stimulation. We silenced the expression of the mitochondrial outer membrane Rho GTPases Miro1 and Miro2, which are components of the adaptor complex that anchors mitochondria to motor proteins (Schwarz, 2013 ; Misgeld & Schwarz, 2017 ). A ratiometric analysis revealed a significant decrease in the fraction of nuclear p65 upon TNF stimulation in Miro1/2\u2010deficient cells (Fig 7B ). Accordingly, NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent transcription was decreased in cells silenced for Miro1 and Miro 2 expression (Fig EV4E ). We then reasoned that mitochondrial transport of p65 to the nucleus should increase the proximity between mitochondria and the nucleus and possibly favor the formation of mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites. To this end, we have generated a new genetically encoded split\u2010GFP contact site sensor (SPLICS) (Cieri et al , 2018 ; Vallese et al , 2020 ; Cali & Brini, 2021 ), capable to reconstitute fluorescence only when the nucleus and mitochondria are in close proximity (Fig 7C ). Correct targeting and self\u2010complementation ability of the GFP 1\u201010 and the \u03b211 split\u2010GFP fragments to the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) were tested (Fig EV5A\u2013C ). The ONM\u2010\u03b211 was further selected to generate the SPLICS NU\u2010MT reporter along with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM)\u2010targeted GFP 1\u201010 , which has been extensively used in all mitochondrial sensors generated so far (Fig 7D ; Cieri et al , 2018 ; Vallese et al , 2020 ). Expression of the SPLICS NU\u2010MT reporter in HeLa cells resulted in the emission of a fluorescent punctate signal within the nuclear/perinuclear region that could be easily quantified with the Fiji ( https://imagej.net/software/fiji/ ) software, and custom macros written for interorganellar contact analysis (Cali & Brini, 2021 ), with an additional ROI traced around the nucleus of SPLICS NU\u2010MT \u2010positive cells to specifically focus only contacts that involve the nuclear envelope (Fig EV5D ). To validate the ability of the SPLICS NU\u2010MT reporter to detect changes in the mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites, we triggered the mitochondrial retrograde response (MRR) in HeLa cells (Amuthan et al , 2001 ; Eisenberg\u2010Bord & Schuldiner, 2017 ; Desai et al , 2020 ; Walker & Moraes, 2022 ). A significant increase in the formation of nucleus\u2010mitochondria contact sites upon MRR activation was observed by employing the SPLICS NU\u2010MT reporter (Fig EV5E ). With this new tool, we assessed whether mitochondrial transport of p65 to the nucleus favors the proximity between mitochondria and the nucleus in TNF\u2010treated SPLICS NU\u2010MT \u2010expressing cells. Indeed, the number of mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites strongly increased upon TNF stimulation (Fig 7E\u2013G ). Remarkably, HOIP silencing by siRNA completely abolished the TNF\u2010induced increase in mitochondria\u2010nucleus contacts (Fig 7H\u2013J ). Thus, different experimental approaches supported the notion that mitochondria are implicated in targeting activated NF\u2010\u03baB to the nucleus upon TNF stimulation and that this process is dependent on linear ubiquitination. Figure 7 Mitochondria facilitate the transfer of p65 to the nucleus A TNF induces the movement of peripheral mitochondria toward the nucleus. Primary macrophages were stained by Mitotracker\u2122 Green to visualize mitochondria and by Hoechst 33342 to visualize the nucleus and monitored every 30 s for 15 min after treatment with TNF (25 ng/ml).

Discussion We identified a mitochondrial signaling platform for NF\u2010\u03baB pathway activation that is shaped by LUBAC\u2010mediated linear ubiquitination. This mitochondrial platform shares some features with a signaling platform that is assembled at cytosol\u2010invading bacteria, such as Salmonella species, to restrict bacterial proliferation. Ubiquitination of the bacterial outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the RNF213 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent binding of LUBAC to pre\u2010existing ubiquitin results in the assembly of M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains and the recruitment of the M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010binding proteins NEMO and Optineurin to the bacterial surface (Noad et al , 2017 ; van Wijk et al , 2017 ; Otten et al , 2021 ). NEMO induces local activation of NF\u2010\u03baB signaling, whereas Optineurin as a selective autophagy receptor promotes the autophagic clearance of bacteria. Similarly to the bacterial NF\u2010\u03baB signaling platform, we observed recruitment of LUBAC, formation of OTULIN\u2010sensitive M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains, and binding and activation of NF\u2010\u03baB signaling components at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In contrast to the bacterial ubiquitin coat, enrichment of linear ubiquitin chains at mitochondria does not induce their autophagic clearance. The formation of mitochondrial signaling platforms has been implicated in various signaling paradigms. However, many aspects of why cells employ mitochondria as signaling organelles are still unknown. One obvious advantage is that the integration of mitochondria in signaling pathways facilitates context\u2010dependent adaptive responses to bioenergetic or biosynthetic demands. Another plausible explanation is that several signaling pathways affect cell fate decisions, which are regulated by mitochondria. Our study revealed two other advantages of mitochondrial signaling platforms. Mitochondria can contribute to signal amplification by virtue of their large surface and the presence of signaling components that stabilize \u201csignals\u201d by forming protein complexes (signalosomes) and/or by posttranslational modifications of signaling components. In TNF signaling, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 performs such a function. It increases the stability of M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains assembled by HOIP by antagonizing the M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific deubiquitinase OTULIN, thus enhancing downstream signaling. Moreover, mitochondria are highly dynamic and mobile organelles, allowing them to communicate and interact with various cellular components and organelles. Here we present evidence that mitochondria can act as vehicles to shuttle activated transcription factors to the nucleus. This mode of transport may be particularly relevant to polarized cells, such as neurons. In support of this notion, NF\u2010\u03baB signaling components are present at synapses and concentrated at postsynaptic densities together with mitochondria, where neuronal activity\u2010dependent retrograde transport of the NF\u2010\u03baB subunit p65 serves as a synapse\u2010to\u2010nucleus signal transducer (Mikenberg et al , 2007 ; Shrum et al , 2009 ). In our study, nuclear translocation of the NF\u2010\u03baB subunit p65 upon TNF stimulation was decreased in cells silenced for Miro1 and Miro2 expression. Even more striking, we found that TNF increases mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites, which presumably facilitate the uptake of p65 into the nuclear compartment. In support of this notion, the expression level of a mitochondria\u2010nucleus tether component identified in breast cancer cells, the mitochondrial translocator protein TSPO, correlated with the abundance of nuclear NF\u2010\u03baB (Desai et al , 2020 ). TNF\u2010induced formation of mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites was dependent on HOIP, confirming a role of M1\u2010linked ubiquitination. In a recent study performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , TOM70 has been implicated in the formation of tethers between mitochondria and the nucleus (Eisenberg\u2010Bord et al , 2021 ). TOM70 has also been identified as a target for ubiquitination within the TNF signaling network (Wagner et al , 2016 ) and was detected as an OTULIN\u2010interacting protein in our mass spectrometry\u2010based screen. In addition, TOM70 is required for the activation of IRF3 in MAVS signaling (Liu et al , 2010 ; Thorne et al , 2022 ). Hence, it will be interesting to explore the possible role of TOM70 in the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. TNF signaling usually mounts an anti\u2010apoptotic response via the TNFR1/complex I/NF\u2010\u03baB axis, implicating transcriptional regulation of anti\u2010 and proapoptotic gene expression (Varfolomeev & Vucic, 2018 ). We previously identified the mitochondrial GTPase OPA1 as an NF\u2010\u03baB target gene, which contributes to anti\u2010apoptotic reprogramming by maintaining cristae integrity (Muller\u2010Rischart et al , 2013 ). Here we identified a fast, transcription\u2010independent anti\u2010apoptotic TNF response that protects mitochondria by remodeling the outer mitochondrial membrane. This remodeling involves the assembly of M1\u2010 and K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains and the recruitment of ubiquitin\u2010binding proteins and signaling components to the outer mitochondrial membrane, which obviously impedes Bax insertion into the outer membrane under proapoptotic conditions. Conceptually, this early TNF response ensures mitochondrial integrity and fitness to fulfill their role in signal amplification and transport of activated NF\u2010\u03baB to the nucleus. Along this line, maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity were increased by TNF treatment. Finally, our study unveiled a mitophagy\u2010independent function of PINK1 in mitochondrial signaling. Previous studies already provided evidence for a role of PINK1 in NF\u2010\u03baB signaling. PINK1 was shown to increase Parkin\u2010mediated K63\u2010linked ubiquitination of NEMO in vitro and in cellular models and to increase TNF\u2010 and IL1\u2010induced transcriptional activity of NF\u2010\u03baB (Sha et al , 2010 ; Akundi et al , 2011 ; Lee et al , 2012 ; Lee & Chung, 2012 ). Moreover, cytosolic PINK1 is stabilized by K63\u2010linked ubiquitination in response to NF\u2010\u03baB pathway activation (Lim et al , 2015 ). In contrast to mitophagy\u2010inducing conditions, PINK1 is stabilized in TNF signaling without dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Accordingly, proteolytically processed, mature PINK1 is stabilized in addition to full\u2010length PINK1 destined for import through the TOM/TIM23 complexes. Albeit the accumulation of the mature PINK1 species after 15 min, TNF treatment is less striking than that of unprocessed PINK1 after 90 min CCCP treatment, several lines of evidence point toward a physiological role of PINK1 in NF\u2010\u03baB signaling. First, PINK1 phosphorylates M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains and thereby decreases the efficiency of OTULIN to hydrolyze linear ubiquitin chains. This explains why TNF\u2010induced M1\u2010ubiquitination is decreased in PINK1\u2010deficient cells. Second, the fast anti\u2010apoptotic TNF response depends on both HOIP and PINK1 expression. PINK1 is stabilized by complex formation with HOIP and HOIP\u2010dependent linear ubiquitination and in turn augments M1\u2010ubiquitination by antagonizing the disassembly of M1\u2010linked ubiquitin chains. This scenario is reminiscent of the feed\u2010forward activation loop in PINK1/Parkin\u2010dependent mitophagy and completes the picture of a mitophagy\u2010independent function of PINK1 and Parkin under physiological conditions that integrate their roles in innate immune signaling and stress protection.

wildtype PINK1\u2010V5 construct was described previously (Exner et al , 2007 ). It was generated by cloning the human PINK1 cDNA into the pcDNA6 vector via NheI and XhoI. For cloning of the kinase dead PINK1\u2010V5 mutant (K219A, D362A, D384A), the construct was modified by point mutations by using the indicated primers. For cloning of the PINK1\u2010\u039477\u2010V5 mutant, the PINK1 sequence 78\u2013581 was cloned into pcDNA6 vector. Wildtype human HOIP, HOIL\u20101L, and SHARPIN were described previously (Muller\u2010Rischart et al , 2013 ). HA\u2010HOIP 1\u2013697 was generated using the indicated primers and then incorporated into pcDNA 3.1\u2010N\u2010HA via EcoRI and XbaI. HA\u2010HOIP \u0394NZF1, HA\u2010HOIP \u0394NZF2, HA\u2010HOIP \u0394NZF1 + 2, HA\u2010HOIP \u0394UBA, and HA\u2010HOIP \u0394PUB were generated by overlap extension PCR (van Well et al , 2019 ; Meschede et al , 2020 ). The amplified fragments were generated using the primers indicated in the Materials section. The ONM\u2010\u03b211 construct has been amplified by PCR from the template pLV\u2010EF1a\u2010Itprip\u2010V5 (Addgene plasmid #120241; http://n2t.net/addgene:120241 ; RRID:Addgene_120241) by using the following primers: Itprip HindIII\u2010FF and RV Itprip XbaI Rev and cloned in pcDNA3 vector containing the short\u2010\u03b211 strand. The OMM\u2010GFP 1\u201010 construct, the GFP 1\u201010 construct, and the RFP\u2010\u03b211 construct have been described previously (Cieri et al , 2018 , Vallese et al , 2020 ). Cell culture HEK293T, HeLa cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin sulfate. PINK1\u2010KO MEFs have been described previously (Muller\u2010Rischart et al , 2013 ). SH\u2010SY5Y cells Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F\u201012 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 1\u00d7 MEM nonessential amino acids solution (Gibco\u2122). HAP1 WT and HAP1 HOIP (RNF31) KO Cells were cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 8 mM L\u2010glutamine. Human primary macrophages Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from commercially available buffy coats from anonymous donors (DRK\u2010Blutspendedienst Baden\u2010W\u00fcrttemberg\u2014Hessen, Institut f\u00fcr Transfusionsmedizin und Immunh\u00e4matologie, Frankfurt, Germany) using Pancoll (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) density centrifugation. Monocytes were separated from PBMC by adherence to plastic after 1 h incubation in a serum\u2010free RPMI1640 medium. To differentiate into macrophages, monocytes were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 3% human serum (DRK\u2010Blutspendedienst Baden\u2010W\u00fcrttemberg\u2014Hessen) for 7 days followed by culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cultured cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination regularly every 3\u20134 months. Transfection and siRNA knockdown Unless described otherwise, transfections were performed using the following procedures: For SH\u2010SY5Y and HeLa cells, Lipofectamine and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA interference, cells were transfected with stealth siRNA oligos (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for co\u2010transfection of siRNA oligos and DNA plasmids. HEK293T cells were transfected using PEI (polyethylenimine). DNA and PEI were mixed in a 1:2 ratio (\u03bcg:\u03bcl) in Opti\u2010MEM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA\u2010PEI mixture was then added to the cells. SPLICS NU\u2010MT transfection Transient transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate method. 30,000 HeLa cells/well were seeded on a 24\u2010well plate on coverslips in the evening. The morning after, a transfection mixture was prepared as follows (quantities reported per well): 50 \u03bcl HEPES buffered saline 2x (Merck), 5 \u03bcl 2.5 M CaCl 2 , 1 + 1 \u03bcg SPLICS NU\u2010MT plasmids, and up to 100 \u03bcl sterile H 2 O. The mixture was added to the wells, each containing 500 \u03bcl of growth medium. After 8 h, the mixture\u2010containing medium was removed and replaced with a fresh medium. 24 h after a medium change, the cells were treated as described below and fixed. SPLICS NU\u2010MT and siRNA co\u2010transfection Co\u2010transfection of SPLICS NU\u2010MT plasmids and siRNAs for HOIP silencing was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher). 400,000 HeLa cells/well were seeded on a 6\u2010well plate in the evening. The morning after, the medium was replaced with 750 \u03bcl/well Opti\u2010MEM (Thermo Fisher), and a transfection mixture with the following composition per well was prepared and added to the wells: 250 \u03bcl Opti\u2010MEM, 0.5 + 0.5 \u03bcg SPLICS NU\u2010MT plasmids, 60 \u03bcM each (180 \u03bcM in total) stealth siRNA oligos (Invitrogen), and 5 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 3,000. 32 h after the addition of the transfection mixture, the cells were detached using trypsin and re\u2010seeded on a 24\u2010well plate on coverslips (30,000 cells/well). 16 h after the re\u2010seeding, the cells were treated as described below and fixed. Immunoblotting Proteins were size\u2010fractionated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk or 5% BSA in TBST (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 16 h at 4\u00b0C. After extensive washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2010conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. Following washing with TBST, the antigen was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Promega) as specified by the manufacturer. In addition, immunoblots with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were imaged by an Azure Sapphire Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems, USA). For quantification of Western blots, Image Studio lite (version 3.1) and Fiji were used for X\u2010ray films and AzureSpot (version 2.0) was used for the Sapphire Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems, USA). Mitochondrial bioenergetics Metabolism of living cells was measured in real\u2010time using Seahorse XF 96 Analyzer. The Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Test was employed to measure basal mitochondrial respiration, maximal mitochondrial respiration, and spare respiratory capacity. The Seahorse Real\u2010Time ATP Rate Assay was used to measure mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production rates in living cells. A Seahorse 96\u2010well cell culture microplate was coated with poly\u2010L\u2010lysine for 10 min before seeding HeLa cells as a density of 1 \u00d7 10 4 . The outer rim of the plates was used for background correction, containing only medium without cells. HeLa cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 in cell culture media before the assay was started. Sensor cartridge was hydrated 1 day prior to sample analysis by sterile H 2 O at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 \u2010free incubator. One to two hours before starting the analysis, water was replaced by 200 \u03bcl of prewarmed Seahorse XF Calibrant per well. All assay compounds (oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone, and antimycin A) were solubilized in DMSO to a stock concentration of 5 mM and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. On the day of the assay, compounds were prepared for loading in XF sensor cartridge. Concentrations were chosen according to the Seahorse assay performed. Stock solution of compounds was mixed with an assay medium to generate 10\u00d7 port concentrations. Compounds were loaded into ports in XF sensor cartridge. XF sensor cartridge plate was placed into the Seahorse XF 96 analyzer and calibration was performed. Afterward, the calibration plate was replaced by the XF cell culture microplate and measurement was started. Prewarmed Seahorse DMEM assay media (pH 7.4) was supplied with 10 mM glucose, 2 mM L\u2010glutamine, and 1 mM pyruvate. Cells were washed once with Seahorse assay media before 180 \u03bcl of Seahorse assay media was added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a non\u2010CO 2 incubator for 45\u201360 min prior to the assay. For the XF Real\u2010Time ATP Rate Assay performed with HeLa cells, Seahorse DMEM assay media was exchanged again before starting the assay. The analysis of Seahorse Assays was performed by Wave Software. Data values were exported to Excel and further analyzed as described in User Manuals. For the Seahorse Real\u2010Time ATP Rate Assay, the Seahorse Report Generator in Excel was used. Statistical Analysis was performed using GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad Software, San Diego California, USA). Expression and purification of recombinant proteins Bacterial expression and purification of GST\u2010tagged proteins (C\u2010terminal HOIP, M1\u2010linked tetra\u2010ubiquitin, tcPINK1), Strep\u2010tagged proteins (OTULIN and UBAN domain), and His\u2010tagged proteins (mouse UBE1 and UBE2L3) were performed by standardized methods (Stieglitz et al , 2012 ; Rasool et al , 2018 ). The proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)\u2010pLys to an OD 600 of 0.6\u20130.8 before induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010thiogalactopyranoside and a change in temperature to 18\u00b0C overnight. In the case of C\u2010terminal HOIP, the medium was supplemented with 150 \u03bcM ZnCl 2 . Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mM Tris\u2013Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT and lysed by a French press. After centrifugation for 40 min at 38,000 g , tagged proteins were affinity\u2010purified with a HisTrap HP nickel column (GE Healthcare) or glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) or StrepTrap XT (Cytiva). For further purification, exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg, Cytiva) or anionic exchange (Hi\u2010Trap Capto Q, Cytiva) was performed. In all purification steps, the eluats were collected, and SDS\u2013PAGE was performed to determine the protein purity. The protein concentration was determined using the absorbance at 280 nm and the extinction coefficient of each construct by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher). Recombinant ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (79586\u201022\u20104). Quantitative RT\u2013PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1,000 ng RNA was reverse\u2010transcribed into cDNA using the iScript\u2122 cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio\u2010RAD, CA, USA). cDNA was diluted 1:5 in PCR\u2010grade dH 2 O and 1.5 \u03bcl of the cDNA\u2010mix was used per 20 \u03bcl real\u2010time PCR reaction with 0.25 \u03bcM of each primer and 2\u00d7 FastStart Essential DNA Green Master Mix (Roche). For each target and reference gene, samples were run in triplicates on a Light Cycler 96 (Roche). On each plate, relevant negative controls were run. Melt curves were studied for all assays, with the Tm checked to be within known specifications for each assay. Standard curves were run for each primer pair. Relative quantification of PINK1 mRNA was performed using the 2 \u2212 \u0394\u0394 C T method. Immunocytochemistry SY\u2010SY5Y, HAP1, MEFs, and neuronal cells were cultivated on glass coverslips (Laboratory Glassware Marienfeld). 24\u201372 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS pH 7.4, fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4, and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X\u2010100 in PBS for 10 min or with 0.5% saponin, 1% BSA in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1% BSA or 5% goat/donkey serum, the cells were stained with primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:100 to 1:1,000 in PBS or 0.5% saponin, 1% BSA in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescent dye\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies AlexaFluor488, 555 or 647 (Thermo Scientific), at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS pH 7.4 three times and subsequently incubated with DAPI (1 \u03bcg/ml) in H 2 O. Following a final wash in H 2 O, cells were mounted in Fluoromount G (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proximity ligation assay In situ proximity ligation assays were performed using the Duolink\u00ae PLA (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). The protocol was adapted from the manufacturer's instruction. Before fixation, cells were stained with MitoTracker\u2122 Red CMXRos Dye (1:10,000) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After fixation and permeabilization according to the immunocytochemistry protocol, cells were incubated with blocking solution provided in the Duolink\u00ae kit for 1 h at 37\u00b0C followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in the Duolink\u00ae antibody diluent overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing the cells three times for 5 min in wash buffer A, the cells were incubated with the PLA probes anti\u2010mouse Minus and anti\u2010rabbit Plus, diluted 1:5 in the Duolink\u00ae antibody diluent in a preheated humidity chamber for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing the cells three times for 5 min in wash buffer A, ligation and amplification were performed with the Duolink\u00ae in situ detection reagents green following the manufacturer's protocol. After the final washing steps in 0.01\u00d7 wash buffer B, the coverslips were mounted with the Duolink\u00ae mounting media. For negative controls, only one primary antibody was used for incubation. For positive controls, mouse anti\u2010TOM20 and rabbit anti\u2010TOM70 antibodies were incubated in parallel. Mitochondrial and nuclear staining in SPLICS NU\u2010MT transfected cells Cells were fixed with 3.75% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X\u2010100 for 10 min, blocked with 1% bovine gelatin in PBS for 10 min three times, and then washed with PBS for 5 min three times. Mitochondria were stained using a 1:100\u2010diluted rabbit anti\u2010TOM20 primary antibody (Santa Cruz). Cells were incubated with the antibody in a wet chamber for 2 h at room temperature, blocked three times with gelatin in PBS for 10 min, and washed three times with PBS for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with a 1:100\u2010diluted AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) in a wet chamber for 45 min at room temperature, rinsed with gelatin in PBS for three times, then nuclei were stained by incubating the cells with 1 \u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 10 min. Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS for 5 min and mounted on glass slides before being analyzed by a Zeiss sp5 confocal microscope. Assessment of the mitochondrial membrane potential For \u0394\u03a8 m determination, HeLa cells were stained with 7 nM tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE). For ratiometric imaging, dual staining was performed with MitoTracker Green FM (MTG), used at a concentration of 100 nM. MTG is a \u0394\u03a8 m independent dye. TMRE is rapidly equilibrated and nontoxic for respiration in those low concentrations. Cells grown on glass coverslips were stained in fresh medium for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 100 nM MitoTracker\u00ae Green FM, washed once with PBS and once with medium, and then imaged in fresh media containing 7 nM TMRE and 10 \u03bcM verapamil (after another 30 min of incubation). MTG emission was recorded between 500 and 510 nm. TMRE was added 30 min before the measurements and kept in a medium throughout the experiments. During imaging, no MTG was present in the medium. TMRE was obtained from Biomol GmbH and MTG from ThermoFisher Scientific. Determination of \u0394\u03c8 was performed by simultaneous TMRE and MTG measurements (Z\u2010stacks, 0.25 nm steps, seven slices) to enable normalization according to Wikstrom et al ( 2007 ) with a cLSM (Leica SP8) equipped with a tunable white light laser (470\u2013670 nm), a 63\u00d7 water objective (N.A. 1.2) and two highly sensitive hybrid GAsP (HyD) detectors. Two technical replicates were conducted. For evaluation, an Otso mask was used to obtain the mitochondria skeleton only. Mean gray values were determined for each cell, and the fluorescence emission ratio (TMRE/MTG) was calculated. Box\u2010and\u2010whisker plot from mean gray value data points (each data point represents the mean of one cell = one mitochondrial network). Error bars denote 5 th to 95 th percentile values, boxes represent 25 th to 75 th percentiles. Vertical lines in boxes represent the median values, whereas square symbols in boxes denote the respective mean values. Minimum and maximum values are denoted by x. Significance levels were determined by a one\u2010way ANOVA: * P \u2264 0.05; ** P \u2264 0.01; *** P \u2264 0.001. Live\u2010cell imaging of mitochondrial movement SH\u2010SY5Y were plated on a 35 mm Ibidi Glass Bottom dish at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells per dish. 48 h after seeding, cells were incubated with 1\u00d7 NucSpot\u00ae Live 488 (Biotium Inc., USA) and 1\u00d7 MitoView\u00ae Fix 640 (Biotium Inc., USA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C prior to imaging. TNF was added immediately before starting the image acquisition. Imaging was carried out using an Elyra 7 Lattice\u2010SIM Super\u2010Resolution microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) every 2 min for 30 min with a 63\u00d7 oil objective (Plan\u2010Apochromat 63\u00d7/NA1.4). Image analysis was performed with Imaris 9.9.1 (Bitplane AG, Switzerland) using the Spot (mitochondria) and surface (nucleus) functions. Mitochondrial shortest distance to the nucleus is color\u2010coded. Macrophages were plated on at 50,000 cells/well in \u03bc\u2010Slide 8\u2010well chambers (80826, Ibidi, Martinsried, Germany) and incubated with 0.5 \u03bcM MitoTracker Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C prior to imaging. The nuclei were stained using 2 \u03bcM Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TNF was added immediately before staring video recording. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscope (LSM800, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and LD Plan\u2010Apochromat 40\u00d7 objective. Electron microscopy Cell grown on ACLAR\u00ae\u2013Fluoropolymer fil (Plano) were fixed by immersion using 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4 overnight at 4\u00b0C. After postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide and pre\u2010embedding staining with 1% uranyl acetate, tissue samples were dehydrated and embedded in Agar 100. Thin sections (80 nm) were counterstained using 1% uranylacetat (aq) and examined using a Talos L120C (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACSymphony A5 cell analyzer. HeLa FlpIn TRex cells stably expressing mt\u2010mKEIMA and doxycycline\u2010inducible Parkin were seeded in 6\u2010well plates 48 h prior to treatment. Parkin expression was induced for 24 h by 0.25 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline. Cells were treated with TNF or antimycin A/oligomycin (10 \u03bcM) for the indicated time (25 ng/ml for 30 min or 10 ng/ml for 16 h) and harvested by Trypsin digestion. 10,000 events were preselected for viable, fluorescent, single cells. Dual\u2010fluorescence for 405 nm (mt\u2010mKEIMA pH 7) and 561 nm (mt\u2010mKEIMA pH 4) excitation and 610/20 nm emission was recorded. The ratio between 561 and 405 nm mt\u2010mKEIMA fluorescence is a measure of mitophagic flux. Mitochondria fractionation To extract crude mitochondria, cells were washed with ice\u2010cold PBS buffer 2 times and scraped from the dishes. Cells were then collected and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 1 min at 4\u00b0C. Cell pellets were resuspended in RSB buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.4) for 2\u20133 min on ice to swell, and then centrifuged at 2,400 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellets were resuspended in 1:1 mixed RSB/MS buffer (420 mM mannitol, 140 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors, N\u2010ethylmaleimide) and lysed with a 23 G needle (10 times) followed by a 26 G needle (5 times). For human macrophages, the cell suspension was lysed with a 30 G needle (5 times) in addition. The lysed cell suspension was diluted 1:1 ratio with MS buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to sediment crude mitochondria. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C to collect purified cytosol. For further purification, the crude mitochondria were resuspended in 36% Opti\u2010prep solution and transferred to a tube, overlayed with 4 ml 30% Opti\u2010prep solution and 4 ml 10% Opti\u2010prep solution. 1 ml diluent (250 mM sucrose, 6 mM EDTA, 120 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was added on top of the gradient. The Opti\u2010prep gradients were centrifuged at 213,000 g for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation, the white fluffy layer between 30 and 10% was collected and diluted with M1 buffer (600 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), centrifuge at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to sediment purified mitochondria. Linear ubiquitination assay Cells were lysed in denaturing lysis buffer (1% SDS in PBS) and heated (95\u00b0C for 10 min). Protein extracts were diluted 1:10 with nondenaturing lysis buffer (1% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS) and cleared by centrifugation. To pull down proteins modified by linear ubiquitin chains, 20 \u03bcg of the recombinant UBAN domain of NEMO was added, which carries an N\u2010terminal Strep\u2010Tag II. After incubation for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, Strep\u2010Tactin beads were added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Proteins binding to the UBAN domain were separated with SDS\u2013PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against M1\u2010 ubiquitin or pan\u2010ubiquitin (in case OTULIN was used as a control for M1\u2010ubiquitin specificity). Co\u2010immunoprecipitation Cells were harvested in cold PBS and subsequently lysed in 1% (v/v) Triton X\u2010100 in PBS supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), N\u2010ethylmaleimide and sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 g and incubated overnight with anti\u2010HA agarose beads at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunopurified proteins were eluted by adding Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) and boiling for 10 min. For endogenous PINK1 immunoprecipitation, crude mitochondria were extracted from cells and lysed in 1% Triton X\u2010100 lysis buffer on ice for 5 min, then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The lysates were incubated with rabbit anti\u2010PINK1 antibody or IgG epitope control overnight at 4\u00b0C. The samples were then incubated with prewashed protein A beads for 3 h. The protein A beads were washed with 1% Triton X\u2010100 lysis buffer 3 times before adding to the samples. The beads were washed three times with 1% Triton X\u2010100 lysis buffer, finally eluted with 2\u00d7 LSB, and analyzed by Western blotting. Size\u2010exclusion chromatography HEK293T cells expressing PINK1\u2010V5 were lysed in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, and complete protease inhibitor) by repeated passing through a syringe needle. After 15 min incubation on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000 g , 20 min, 4\u00b0C). Protein concentration of the samples was measured by the Bradford protein assay and equal amounts of proteins were loaded on the column. Proteins were separated on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column using an \u00c4KTA chromatography system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). 0.5 or 1 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against HOIP and the V5 tag. In vitro ubiquitination assay PINK1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by anti\u2010V5 beads. The beads were washed three times with 1% Triton X\u2010100 lysis buffer and twice with ubiquitination reaction buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM TCEP), and then incubated with recombinant ubiquitin (30 \u03bcM), mouse Ube1 (0.1 \u03bcM), UBE2L3 (1 \u03bcM), C\u2010terminal HOIP (4 \u03bcM) and ATP (2 mM) in the in vitro ubiquitination reaction buffer for 90 min at 30\u00b0C. Reactions were terminated by adding 5\u00d7 LSB into the reaction mix at 97\u00b0C for 3 min. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting. In vitro deubiquitination assay Recombinant M1\u2010linked tetra\u2010ubiquitin (2.5 \u03bcg) was incubated with or without 16 \u03bcg tcPINK1 or 16 \u03bcg BSA as a control for 48 h at 30\u00b0C in kinase buffer (500 mM Tris, 100 mM MgCl 2 , 10 nM ATP, 10 mM DTT). For the DUB assay, 0.26 \u03bcg recombinant OTULIN was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for the indicated time. The DUB reaction was terminated by 5\u00d7 LSB and heating (80\u00b0C). The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting and Phos\u2010tag\u2122 PAGE. Cellular deubiquitination assay PINK1 was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates as described above and the beads were resuspended in low salt buffer containing recombinant OTULIN (2 mM) and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 5\u00d7 LSB and heating (95\u00b0C). The samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Apoptosis assays Activated caspase\u20103 was quantified as described previously (Meschede et al , 2020 ). In brief, cells plated on glass coverslips were stained with antibodies against activated caspase\u20103 by indirect immunofluorescence, and signals were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. For the assessment of Bax recruitment, mitochondrial fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using Bax\u2010specific antibodies. For analyzing cytochrome c release, subcellular fractionation was performed by differential centrifugation. The cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against cytochrome c . Image acquisition Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss ELYRA PS.1 equipped with an LSM880 (Carl Zeiss, Jena) and a 20\u00d7, 63\u00d7 oil, or 100\u00d7 oil immersion objective or a C2+ system (Nikon). Super\u2010resolution images were generated by structured iIlumination microscopy (SIM) using 405, 488, and 561 nm widefield laser illumination. SIM confocal images were processed using the ZEN2.3 software (Carl Zeiss, Jena). For the p65 translocation assay, laser scanning microscopy was performed using the 405, 488, and 561 laser illumination set in individual channels to avoid cross\u2010talk. For live\u2010cell experiments, imaging was carried out using an ELYRA 7 Lattice\u2010SIM Super\u2010Resolution microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 63\u00d7 oil objective (Plan\u2010Apochromat 63\u00d7/NA1.4). Image analysis Mitochondrial movement For the analysis of mitochondrial movement, cells were incubated with MitotrackerGreen\u2122 (50 nM) and Hoechst (5 \u03bcg/ml) and imaged every 30 s after treatment with TNF (25 ng/ml). Mitochondria and the nucleus were segmented using Imaris 9.8 Surface and Spot modules and mitochondrial spots were classified with respect to the nuclear distance. Cytosolic/nuclear ratio of the p65 signal HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with control or Miro1\u2010 and Miro2\u2010specific siRNAs. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml) for 15 min and then fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X\u2010100 for 30 min and blocked with 5% donkey or goat serum in 0.2% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with an anti\u2010p65 and anti\u2010tubulin antibody diluted in a blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing, the cells were incubated with AlexaFluor488 and AlexaFluor555 secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed extensively with PBS and then mounted onto glass slides and analyzed by laser scanning microscopy (LSM). For the analysis of the signal intensity ratio between the cytosol and the nucleus, LSM datasets including stainings for the whole cell (tubulin), p65, and the nucleus (DAPI) were exported using Zeiss Zen Blue (2.1). Based on the individual channels, datasets were segmented in a cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment and the fluorescence p65 signal intensity ratio for every cell was measured using CellProfiler 4.2.1. Alternatively, the translocation of p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus was determined by indirect immunofluorescence based on single\u2010cell analysis. SH\u2010SY5Y cells or MEFs were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with control or PINK1\u2010specific siRNA. For rescue experiment, cells were co\u2010transfected with WT PINK1, PINK1\u039477, or kinase\u2010dead PINK1\u2010K/D mutant. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with TNF (25 ng/ml, 25 min) and then fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X\u2010100 for 10 min and blocked with 5% donkey or goat serum in 0.2% Triton X\u2010100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with an anti\u2010p65 antibody diluted in a blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. After extensive washing, cells were incubated with an ALEXA488\u2010conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed extensively with PBS and then mounted onto glass slides and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) and transfected cells were visualized by EGFP or mCherry plasmid co\u2010transfection. Mitochondrial ultrastructure High\u2010resolution images of mitochondria were imported into Imaris 9.8, and the scale was adjusted using the correct pixel sizes. For the analysis of average cristae number/mitochondrial area, Imaris 9.8 surface function was used, and for the average cristae length, data were collected using a direct measure function. Proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) positive foci quantification To analyze the PLA\u2010positive foci, the images were captured through laser scanning microscopy. Captured images were segmented with cytoplasmic and nucleus compartment, and the PLA foci were identified and counted through Cell Profiler 3.1.9. Mass spectrometry\u2010based analysis for the identification of OTULIN interaction partners In\u2010gel digestion was performed as previously described (Sima et al , 2021 ). 200 ng tryptic peptides were subsequently measured by nano\u2010LC\u2010ESI\u2010MS/MS. An UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano\u2010LC system (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was utilized for nano\u2010HPLC analysis using the following solvent system: (A) 0.1% FA; (B) 84% ACN, 0.1% FA. Samples were loaded on a trap column (Thermo, 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 2 cm, particle size 5 \u03bcm, pore size 100 \u00c5, C18) with a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min with 0.1% TFA. After sample concentration and washing, the trap column was serially connected with an analytical C18 column (Thermo, 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 50 cm, particle size 2 \u03bcm, pore size 100 \u00c5), and the peptides were separated with a flow rate of 400 nl/min using a solvent gradient of 4% to 40% B for 98 min at 60\u00b0C. After each sample measurement, 1 h of column washing was performed for equilibration. The HPLC system was online connected to the nano\u2010electrospray ionization source of an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data\u2010dependent mode with the spray voltage set to 1,600 V in positive mode and a capillary temperature of 275\u00b0C. Full scan MS spectra (mass range 300\u20132,000 m / z ) were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer at a mass resolution of 60,000. The 20 most intensive ions per spectra were subsequently fragmented using collision\u2010induced dissociation (35% normalized collision energy) and scanned in the linear ion trap. The m / z values triggering MS/MS were set on a dynamic exclusion list for 30 s. Proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant (v. 1.6.17.0, https://maxquant.org/ ) using Andromeda as a search engine. Spectra were matched against UniProt/Swiss\u2010Prot using human taxonomy (released 2021_02). Methionine oxidation was set as variable modifications; cysteine carbamidomethylation was a fixed one. The minimum number of peptides and razor peptides for protein identification was 1; the minimum number of unique peptides was 0. Protein identification was performed at a protein false discovery rate of 0.01. The \u201cmatch between runs\u201d option was on. Intensity\u2010based absolute quantification (iBAQ) was used to estimate protein abundances (Tyanova et al , 2016 ). The Gene Ontology Cellular Compartment (GOCC) annotation was performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 (Huang da et al , 2009a , b ). Factory settings were maintained. Resulting tables were exported into excel, and the number of proteins from the identified cellular compartments were visualized in the pie chart. Quantification and statistical analysis For the quantification of mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites, Image analysis and contacts quantification was carried on using the ImageJ distribution Fiji ( https://imagej.net/software/fiji/ ), ImageJ plugin VolumeJ, and custom macros were written for interorganelle contacts analysis. The analysis was done as previously described (Cali & Brini, 2021 ). An ROI was traced around the nucleus of probe\u2010positive cells to quantify only contacts that involve the nuclear envelope. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SD or SEM, n numbers are indicated in the figure legends. For the quantification analysis in which manual counting was used, not all experiments were performed in a blinded manner. All statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad PRISM (Version 5; San Diego, CA, USA) with the exception of mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites, which were assessed by GraphPad Prism 8. To check the normal distribution of data, the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was applied. Based on the outcome of the test, appropriate parametric and nonparametric tests were chosen. For the comparison of two independent parametric datasets, the student's t \u2010test was used. For the comparison of more than 2 parametric datasets, one\u2010way ANOVA was applied. To correct for \u03b1\u2010error inflation resulting from multiple comparisons, ANOVA was followed by the Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison tests. For the direct comparison of two nonparametric datasets, the Wilcoxon Mann\u2013Whitney ( U \u2010test), and for the comparison of more than more 2 nonparametric datasets, the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used. Significance levels for all tests: * P \u2264 0.05; ** P \u2264 0.01; *** P \u2264 0.001.

    "full_text_abstract": "Abstract Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as cellular hubs to orchestrate signaling pathways that regulate metabolism, redox homeostasis, and cell fate decisions. Recent research revealed a role of mitochondria also in innate immune signaling; however, the mechanisms of how mitochondria affect signal transduction are poorly understood. Here, we show that the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway activated by TNF employs mitochondria as a platform for signal amplification and shuttling of activated NF\u2010\u03baB to the nucleus. TNF treatment induces the recruitment of HOIP, the catalytic component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), and its substrate NEMO to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where M1\u2010 and K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains are generated. NF\u2010\u03baB is locally activated and transported to the nucleus by mitochondria, leading to an increase in mitochondria\u2010nucleus contact sites in a HOIP\u2010dependent manner. Notably, TNF\u2010induced stabilization of the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 furthermore contributes to signal amplification by antagonizing the M1\u2010ubiquitin\u2010specific deubiquitinase OTULIN. Overall, our study reveals a role for mitochondria in amplifying TNF\u2010mediated NF\u2010\u03baB activation, both serving as a signaling platform, as well as a transport mode for activated NF\u2010\u03baB to the nuclear.\n\nTNF induces remodeling of the outer mitochondrial membrane by assembling an NF\u2010\u03baB signaling platform that facilitates nuclear translocation of activated NF\u2010\u03baB."
