Here, we describe the results for patients with rheumatic disease.<h4>Methods</h4>Eligible patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were recruited and received intravenous CT-P13 induction and/or maintenance therapy. Patients were either naive to IFX (IFX-naive) or had been previously treated with IFX originator or another IFX biosimilar (IFX-switched). CT-P13 persistence (primary objective) was measured as a time-dependent variable during a 2-year follow-up period. Safety was also assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The patient population comprised 142 patients with RA (IFX-naive: n = 70; IFX-switched: n = 69; other [i.e., previously received IFX, but received another treatment before switching to CT-P13]: n = 3); 411 patients with AS (IFX-naive: n = 189; IFX-switched; n = 201; other: n = 21); and 96 patients with PsA (IFX-naive: n = 44; IFX-switched: n = 47; other: n = 5). After 2 years of follow-up, CT-P13 persistence rates were 49.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40.4-60.8%), 62.7% (95% CI 56.6-69.5%), and 73.0% (95% CI 62.7-85.1%) in patients with RA, AS, and PsA, respectively. CT-P13 persistence was greater for IFX-switched than IFX-naive groups in patients with RA (65.4% [95% CI 52.8-81.0%] vs. 33.3% [22.7-49.1%]) and AS (66.5% [95% CI 58.3-76.0%] vs. 56.6% [47.6-67.4%]) and was similar between IFX-switched and IFX-naive groups in patients with PsA (75.9% [95% CI 62.2-92.8%] vs. 72.0% [57.5-90.1%]). The main reason for CT-P13 discontinuation was loss of response (RA/AS/PsA) in both IFX-naive (38.6%/23.3%/22.7%) and IFX-switched 18.8%/18.4%/12.8%) groups. Among patients (RA, AS, and PsA), 52.1%, 57.9%, and 56.3%, respectively, reported ≥ 1 adverse event (AE), and 14.1%, 11.4%, and 10.4%, respectively, reported serious AEs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>After 2 years of follow-up, the effectiveness of intravenous CT-P13 was maintained in > 65% of IFX-switched patients and CT-P13 induced effective therapeutic maintenance in IFX-naive patients. CT-P13 had an acceptable safety profile.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02925338.",

Introduction ReFLECT was a French multicenter, observational cohort study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CT-P13, an infliximab (IFX) biosimilar, in a real-world setting. Here, we describe the results for patients with rheumatic disease. Methods Eligible patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were recruited and received intravenous CT-P13 induction and/or maintenance therapy.

Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12325-025-03304-6. Plain Language Summary Biosimilars are approved biologics that are highly similar in structure to original biologics. CT-P13 is an infliximab biosimilar used to treat patients with rheumatic diseases. This study looked at how effective and safe CT-P13 was in a real-life setting in patients with rheumatic diseases. We studied 142 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 411 with ankylosing spondylitis, and 96 with psoriatic arthritis who were living in France and were prescribed CT-P13 as their first infliximab treatment (infliximab-naive) or switched from the original infliximab biologic or another infliximab biosimilar to CT-P13 (infliximab-switched). Two years after CT-P13 initiation, 49.6% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 62.7% with ankylosing spondylitis, and 73.0% with psoriatic arthritis were still taking CT-P13. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, more infliximab-switched (65.4−66.5%) than infliximab-naive (33.3−56.6%) patients continued taking CT-P13 2 years after starting treatment. Around the same percentage of infliximab-switched (75.9%) and infliximab-naive (72.0%) patients with psoriatic arthritis continued taking CT-P13 2 years after starting treatment. If CT-P13 treatment was discontinued, it was mainly because of loss of response. Corticosteroid use generally decreased with time in all patients with rheumatoid disease. Most (52.1−57.9%) patients with rheumatic diseases reported at least one adverse event, but few (10.4−14.1%) reported any serious adverse events. CT-P13 is an effective and safe treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases, regardless of whether patients take CT-P13 as their first infliximab treatment or switch from another infliximab treatment to CT-P13.

Randomized studies demonstrated that CT-P13 is efficacious and safe in patients with rheumatic diseases, but knowledge gaps and uncertainty about the role of biosimilars were identified among physicians and patients after biosimilars were introduced into clinical practice in rheumatology. This study was conducted to provide support for the safety and efficacy of switching to CT-P13 in a real-world setting for patients with rheumatic disease. What was learned from this study? After 2 years of follow-up, 49.6%, 62.7%, and 73.0% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis, respectively, remained on CT-P13. Two-year treatment persistence rates were 65.4−75.9% for patients who switched from infliximab originator or another infliximab biosimilar to CT-P13 and 33.3−72.0% for patients who were naive to infliximab, suggesting higher persistence in patients who are on stable and effective infliximab treatment before switching to a biosimilar. CT-P13 is a safe and effective treatment for patients with rheumatic disease; it induced therapeutic maintenance in those receiving infliximab for the first time and sustained disease control in those who switched from previous infliximab treatments to CT-P13, without any new safety concerns. Introduction CT-P13 (Inflectra ® ; Pfizer Europe MA EEIG, Brussels, Belgium, and Remsima ® ; Celltrion Healthcare, Hungary Kft, Budapest, Hungary) is a biosimilar of reference infliximab (IFX-EU) marketed in the EU (Remicade ® , Janssen Biotech, Horsham, PA, USA, and Janssen Biologics B.V., Leiden, The Netherlands) [ 1 , 2 ]. CT-P13 was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody to be approved by the EMA in 2013 [ 3 – 5 ] and is authorized for all disease indications of IFX-EU [ 1 , 2 ]. Biosimilar approval of CT-P13 was based on an extensive development program that included two double-blind, randomized clinical trials—PLANETRA and PLANETAS—which demonstrated therapeutic equivalence of CT-P13 and IFX-EU in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), respectively [ 6 , 7 ]. NOR-SWITCH, a randomized, double-blind, phase 4 study, provides evidence that CT-P13 is efficacious and safe in patients with RA, AS, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), chronic plaque psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ 8 – 10 ]. The NOR-SWITCH main trial demonstrated noninferiority in efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of switching from IFX originator to CT-P13 after 52 weeks of treatment. In the NOR-SWITCH extension study, there was no difference in safety and efficacy between patients who continued CT-P13 for an additional 26 weeks and those who switched from IFX originator to CT-P13 at the end of the randomized period (week 52). Knowledge gaps and uncertainty about the role of biosimilars were identified among physicians and patients after biosimilars were introduced into clinical practice in rheumatology. In a 2015 survey of French rheumatologists, 50% of respondents ( n = 116) lacked confidence in prescribing biosimilars because they did not feel sufficiently informed about their safety [ 11 ]. Most respondents raised concerns (69.8%) or expressed a negative opinion (57.8%) about substitution by the pharmacist of a reference product with its biosimilar medicine [ 11 ]. Furthermore, 67.2% cited concerns in extrapolating results from biosimilar studies in one indication to all indications of the reference product as a barrier to prescribing biosimilars [ 11 ]. In a 2017 nationwide survey of French patients treated for rheumatic diseases, 65% of patients who were aware of biosimilars ( n = 273) felt insufficiently informed about them [ 12 ]. Among all respondents ( N = 629), most worried about the biosimilar being less effective (60%), less safe (57%), and of lower quality (53%) than the reference product [ 12 ]. Furthermore, 47% of respondents cited scientific arguments—especially safety and efficacy data—as the best incentive for converting patients from reference to biosimilar medicines [ 12 ]. ReFLECT was a multicenter, observational cohort study conducted in France to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of CT-P13 in adult patients with rheumatic diseases (RA, AS, or PsA) and adult and pediatric patients with IBD (Crohn’s disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]) in a real-world setting [ 13 ]. The study was completed to provide support for the safety and efficacy of switching to CT-P13. Herein, we report results for patients with rheumatic diseases who were either naive to IFX and started on CT-P13 (IFX-naive) or previously treated with IFX originator or another IFX biosimilar and switched to CT-P13 (IFX-switched). Methods Study Design and Patients ReFLECT was a national, multicenter, observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02925338) conducted at public or private hospitals in France where CT-P13 was on formulary. Adult (≥ 18 years) patients with RA, AS, or PsA and adult and pediatric (6–17 years) patients with CD or UC who were treated with intravenous CT-P13 (Inflectra ® , Pfizer Europe MA EEIG, Brussels, Belgium) according to the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) were eligible for inclusion. Patients who refused access to their medical record; were not treated with CT-P13; were treated with CT-P13 for psoriasis; had a history of hypersensitivity to IFX, other murine proteins, or one of the excipients of CT-P13; or had moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association III/IV criteria) were excluded from study entry. Patients were recruited consecutively; at each participating center, all patients for whom CT-P13 was prescribed in accordance with the SmPC and who met eligibility criteria were included in the study. Patients with RA received 3 mg/kg intravenous CT-P13 followed by additional 3 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks after the first infusion and then every 8 weeks thereafter. CT-P13 was given concomitantly with methotrexate. Patients with AS received a 5-mg/kg IV infusion followed by additional 5-mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks after the first infusion and then every 6 to 8 weeks. Patients with PsA received a 5 mg/kg infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks after the first infusion and then every 8 weeks thereafter. The study did not modify or influence current medical practice regarding the prescription and use of IFX. Patients could have switched from IFX originator or from another IFX biosimilar, including CT-P13, marketed as Remsima ® (Celltrion Healthcare Hungary Kft., Budapest, Hungary) or SB2 (Flixabi ® , Samsung Bioepis NL B.V., The Netherlands), to CT-P13 (IFX-switched) or have been naive to IFX at the time of CT-P13 initiation (IFX-naive). Patients (IFX-naive and IFX-switched) could have received their first CT-P13 administration (Month 0 [M0]) at the time of study entry (i.e., M0 was concomitant with inclusion) or could have initiated CT-P13 before study entry (i.e., M0 preceded inclusion). Most patients had been receiving CT-P13 for approximately 12 months before inclusion. Patients were enrolled over approximately 2 years (October 2016 to April 2019) and follow-up continued for up to 2 years (study completion: April 2021). Data of interest were captured from patients’ medical records by investigators at inclusion (baseline), M0, and at least every 6 months thereafter until treatment discontinuation during the follow-up period (6 [M6], 12 [M12], 18 [M18], and 24 [M24] months post-inclusion) using an electronic Case Report Form. All patients who withdrew their consent to participate were excluded from the analysis. In this report, we present results for patients with rheumatic diseases only; results for adult patients with IBD were reported separately [ 14 ]. Ethical Considerations Patients (or their legal representatives) completed a written informed consent form and authorized access to their clinical data and medical records before enrollment. This observational study was registered with the National Commission on Data Processing and Freedoms. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the French Advisory Committee on the Treatment of Information in Health Research (CCTIR no. 16-207; 23/03/2016) and by the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) (approval ref. MMS/VCS/ARS169124/request no. 916228; 30/09/2016)), which were the requirements at the time this study was conducted. Primary Objectives and Assessments Primary objectives of the study were to describe the profiles of patients with RA, AS, or PsA who were treated with CT-P13, as summarized by sociodemographic and disease characteristics, medical history, and prior treatments at inclusion (Fig. S1 ), and CT-P13 treatment persistence in patients with RA, AS, or PsA, described by treatment subgroup (IFX-naive and IFX-switched) but irrespective of the type (originator or biosimilar) of previous IFX treatment. Within each indication (RA, AS, and PsA), CT-P13 treatment persistence was expressed as the percentage of patients without treatment failure during the follow-up period. Treatment failure was defined as permanent discontinuation (i.e., until the end of follow-up) from CT-P13 due to intolerance and/or lack or loss of response according to the physician’s assessment or death of the patient if it was related to CT-P13. Prespecified Secondary Objectives and Assessments Secondary objectives were to describe the conditions for use and the safety profile of CT-P13 in patients with RA, AS, or PsA in a real-world setting (Fig. S1 ). Conditions for use of CT-P13 were described by CT-P13 prescribing practices, biochemical parameters, and disease activity. CT-P13 prescribing practices included details of CT-P13 administration (e.g., number of infusions, posology or dose administered, etc.) and concomitant treatments, summarized overall and by visit (Fig. S1 ). Biochemical parameters (C-reactive protein [CRP], rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody) were measured across visits (Fig. S1 ). Disease activity was measured by patient clinical status and by disease-specific activity scores across visits, including: physician's global assessment of disease activity and patient’s assessment of fatigue, both on a 0–10 visual analog scale (RA, AS, and PsA); disease activity score-28 (DAS28), simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) for patients with RA; Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) for patients with AS; and DAS28 for patients with PsA (Fig. S1 ). The safety profile of CT-P13 was measured by the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs of special interest (AESIs) related to CT-P13 (Fig. S1 ). AEs were recorded at each follow-up visit and coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology. Statistical Analysis This was an ambispective study, as some patients may have received their first CT-P13 infusion at study entry or inclusion, and some patients were already receiving CT-P13 before study inclusion. Therefore, “baseline” or “inclusion” terminology refers to the initial time point of patient entry into the study or the study start. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, depending on the nature of the variable (qualitative vs. quantitative data): frequency and percentage, with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) when considered relevant; mean, with standard deviation (SD); and median, with quartiles and range. CT-P13 treatment persistence was expressed as the percentage of patients without treatment failure with the 95% CI and was analyzed using a survival method. Patients who were already on CT-P13 at study inclusion were not at risk of treatment failure before study inclusion (immortal time). Therefore, immortal time bias was addressed using a Kaplan-Meier method with left truncation and right censoring to analyze time to treatment failure. Post hoc analysis of treatment persistence was performed considering treatment failure for patients lost to follow-up, who withdrew their consent during the study, who decided to drop out of the study, and who were withdrawn from the study for another reason. For safety, the incidences of AEs and AESIs were reported. Results Patient and Treatment Characteristics Between October 19, 2016, and April 29, 2019, 649 patients with rheumatic disease were enrolled across 71 sites and received treatment with CT-P13, including 142 (21.9%) with RA, 411 (63.3%) with AS, and 96 (14.8%) with PsA.

At baseline, mean (± SD) DAS28 scores were 3.8 (± 1.4) and 2.9 (± 1.2) for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively; mean (± SD) SDAI scores were 22.9 (± 18.0) and 12.7 (± 10.9), respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline CRP concentrations were 5.0 (1.4, 12.0) and 3.0 (1.9, 7.5) mg/l for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively. Overall, 72.5% ( n = 103) of all patients with RA were already on CT-P13 at inclusion, for a mean (± SD) duration of 12.88 (± 21.48) months. Among these patients, mean (± SD) DAS28 scores were 4.80 (± 1.16) and 2.62 (± 0.85) for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively; mean (± SD) SDAI scores were 36.0 (± 19.8) and 8.3 (± 5.4), respectively; median (Q1, Q3) CRP concentrations were 10.6 (4.0, 26.0) and 3.6 (1.0, 8.0) mg/l, respectively.

Overall, 46.0% ( n = 189) of patients were IFX-naive, 48.9% ( n = 201) were IFX-switched, and 5.1% ( n = 21) had other treatment history. At baseline, mean (± SD) BASDAI scores were 4.18 (± 2.13) and 2.71 (± 2.03) for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively; mean (± SD) BASFI scores were 3.70 (± 2.48) and 2.95 (± 2.36), respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline CRP concentrations were 3.2 (1.0, 9.0) and 2.5 (1.0, 4.5) mg/l for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively. Overall, 76.6% ( n = 314) of all patients with AS were already on CT-P13 at inclusion, for a mean (± SD) duration of 12.70 (± 9.5) months. Among these patients, mean (± SD) BASDAI scores were 5.54 (± 1.93) and 2.56 (± 2.14) for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively; mean (± SD) BASFI scores were 5.24 (± 2.25) and 3.29 (± 2.60), respectively; median (Q1, Q3) CRP concentrations were 5.0 (2.1, 16.6) and 2.0 (1.0, 5.0) mg/l, respectively. Among patients with PsA ( N = 96), median (Q1, Q3) age was 55 (45, 63) years and 58.3% were female (Table 3 ). Overall, 45.8% ( n = 44) of patients were IFX-naive, 49.0% ( n = 47) were IFX-switched, and 5.2% ( n = 5) had other treatment history. At baseline, mean (± SD) DAS28 scores were 3.4 (± 1.5) and 2.4 (± 0.9) for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively; median (Q1, Q3) baseline CRP concentrations were 3.1 (1.0, 9.4) and 2.0 (1.0, 5.0) mg/l, respectively. Overall, 80.2% ( n = 77) of all patients with PsA were already on CT-P13 at inclusion, for a mean (± SD) duration of 12.0 (± 9.9) months. Among these patients, mean (± SD) DAS28 scores were 4.0 (± 1.1) and 2.4 (± 1.0) for IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, respectively; median (Q1, Q3) CRP concentrations were 4.7 (2.0, 11.6) and 2.0 (0.9, 3.0) mg/l, respectively. Ct-P13 Treatment Evolution and Persistence Across indications (RA, AS and PsA, respectively), 54.9% (78/142), 61.1% (251/411), and 68.8% (66/96) of patients completed the study according to protocol, and 45.1% (64/142), 38.9% (160/411), and 31.3% (30/96), were prematurely withdrawn from the study (Table S4). Of those who were prematurely withdrawn from the study and with available data, most discontinued the study because of permanent treatment discontinuation (RA: 89.1% [57/64]; AS: 84.7% [133/157]; PsA: 85.7% [24/28]), mainly because of treatment failure (RA: 64.9%; AS: 63.6%; PsA: 62.5%) and intolerance (RA: 24.6%; AS: 12.1%; PsA: 29.2%). When CT-P13 was stopped, most patients switched to another IFX treatment (IFX originator or Remsima) or biotherapy (RA: 67.9%; AS: 73.6%; PsA: 69.6%). Estimated rates of CT-P13 treatment persistence among all patients with rheumatic diseases were 73.8% (95% CI 69.0%, 79.0) at M12 ( n = 568) and 60.8% (95% CI 56.0%, 66.0%) at M24 ( n = 504) after CT-P13 initiation. Treatment persistence at M24 after CT-P13 initiation was 67.4% (95% CI 60.9%, 74.7%) for IFX-switched patients ( n = 258) and 52.1% (95% CI 45.1%, 60.1%) for IFX-naive patients ( n = 221). For patients with RA, estimated rates of CT-P13 treatment persistence at M12 and M24 after CT-P13 initiation were 65.4% (95% CI: 55.6%, 76.9%) and 49.6% (40.4%, 60.8%), respectively (Fig. 1 a). Treatment persistence at M24 was 65.4% (95% CI: 52.8%, 81.0%) for IFX-switched patients and 33.3% (22.7%, 49.1%) for IFX-naive patients (Fig. 1 a). Overall, 43.0% (61/142) of patients permanently discontinued CT-P13, including 52.9% (37/70) and 34.8% (24/69) in the IFX-naive and IFX-switched groups, respectively (Fig. S2a), mainly because of treatment failure according to physician’s assessment (IFX-naive: 38.6% [27/70]; IFX-switched: 18.8% [13/69]) and intolerance (IFX-naive: 12.9% [9/70]; IFX-switched: 8.7% [6/69]) (Fig. S2b). Of those who permanently discontinued CT-P13 and with available data ( N = 60), 70% ( n = 42) switched to another treatment (Fig. S2c), including a switch back to IFX originator (21.4% [9/42]) or switch to another IFX biosimilar (SB2; 4.8% [2/42]), non-IFX TNF inhibitor (TNFi; 7.1% [3/42]), or treatment/mechanism of action (66.7% [28/42]). Fig. 1 Kaplan-Meier curves of CT-P13 treatment persistence in patients with RA ( a ), AS ( b ) and PsA ( c ) a . a Patients who were already on CT-P13 at study inclusion were not at risk of treatment failure before entering the study (immortal time). Therefore, immortal time bias was addressed using a Kaplan-Meier method with left truncation and right censoring to analyze time to treatment failure.

Treatment persistence at M24 was 66.5% (95% CI 58.3%, 76.0%) for IFX-switched patients and 56.6% (47.6%, 67.4%) for IFX-naive patients (Fig. 1 b). Overall, 33.1% (136/411) of patients permanently discontinued CT-P13, including 37.0% (70/189) and 29.9% (60/201) in the IFX-naive and IFX-switched groups, respectively (Fig. S3a), mainly because of treatment failure according to physician’s assessment (IFX-naive: 23.3% [44/189]; IFX-switched: 18.4% [37/201]) and intolerance (IFX-naive: 5.3% [10/189]; IFX-switched: 3.0% [6/201]) (Fig. S3b). Of those who permanently discontinued CT-P13 and with available data ( N = 132), 73.5% ( n = 97) switched to another treatment (Fig. S3c), including a switch back to IFX originator (29.9% [29/97]), or switch to another IFX biosimilar (SB2; 12.4% [12/97]), non-IFX TNFi (20.6% [20/97]), or treatment/mechanism of action (37.1% [36/97]). For patients with PsA, estimated rates of CT-P13 treatment persistence at M12 and M24 after CT-P13 initiation were 86.5% (95% CI 77.8%, 96.2%) and 73.0% (62.7%, 85.1%), respectively (Fig. 1 c). Treatment persistence at M24 was 75.9% (95% CI 62.2%, 92.8%) for IFX-switched patients and 72.0% (57.5%, 90.1%) for IFX-naive patients (Fig. 1 c). Overall, 29.2% (28/96) of patients permanently discontinued CT-P13, including 27.3% (12/44) and 29.8% (14/47) in the IFX-naive and IFX-switched groups, respectively (Fig. S4a), mainly because of treatment failure according to physician’s assessment (IFX-naive: 22.7% [10/44]; IFX-switched: 12.8% [6/47]) and intolerance (IFX-naive: 4.5% [2/44]; IFX-switched: 10.6% [5/47]) (Fig. S4b). Of those who permanently discontinued CT-P13 and with available data ( N = 27), 66.7% ( n = 18) switched to another treatment (Fig. S4c), including a switch back to IFX originator (33.3% [6/18]) or switch to a non-IFX TNFi (27.8% [5/18]) or to another treatment/mechanism of action (38.9% [7/18]). Disease Activity and Biochemical Parameters Changes in disease activity across visits are shown in Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 for patients with RA, AS, and PsA, respectively. For patients with RA, mean (± SD) DAS28 and SDAI scores at M0 were 4.8 (± 1.2) and 34.3 (± 17.9), respectively, in the IFX-naive group and 2.6 (± 0.9) and 9.8 (± 7.5), respectively, in the IFX-switched group (Fig. 2 a, b). In IFX-naive patients, mean DAS28 score decreased from M0 to M6 and then remained relatively stable until M24 (3.5 ± 1.3); mean SDAI decreased over time until M24 (17.0 ± 15.8). In IFX-switched patients, both mean DAS28 and SDAI scores remained stable across visits (M24: 2.4 ± 0.9 and 6.4 ± 7.9, respectively).

In IFX-naive patients, mean BASDAI score decreased over time until M24 (3.2 ± 2.2); mean BASFI decreased from M0 to M6 and then remained relatively stable until M24 (3.4 ± 2.4). In IFX-switched patients, both mean BASDAI and BASFI scores remained stable across visits (M24: 2.7 ± 1.8 and 3.4 ± 2.7, respectively). For patients with PsA, mean DAS28 score at M0 was 4.2 (± 1.1) and 2.2 (± 0.9) in the IFX-naive and IFX-switched groups, respectively (Fig. 4 a). In IFX-naive patients, mean DAS28 score decreased from M0 to M6 and then remained relatively stable until M24 (2.8 ± 1.6); DAS28 score remained stable across visits for IFX-switched patients (M24: 2.9 ± 1.0). Regardless of the indication, CRP concentration decreased from M0 to the end of follow-up in IFX-naive patients. Conversely, there was no change in CRP concentration throughout follow-up in IFX-switched patients (Figs. 2 c, 3 c and 4 b). Safety An overview of safety by indication and treatment group is provided in Table 4 . Overall, 56.4% (366/649) of patients reported at least one AE, 11.9% (77/649) reported SAEs, and 24.5% (159/649) reported AESIs with possible relationship to CT-P13. The incidences of AEs and SAEs were 58.1% and 10.6%, respectively, in the IFX-naive group and 55.8% and 12.6%, respectively, in the IFX-switched group. The most frequently reported specific AEs were infections (severe infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, hepatitis B) in 7.7% (11/142), 4.9% (20/411), and 5.2% (5/96) of patients with RA, AS, and PsA, respectively, and adverse reactions due to perfusion (acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions) in 3.5% (5/142), 2.9% (12/411), and 1.0% (1/96) of patients, respectively.

COVID-19 infection was reported in 0.2% (1/411) of patients with AS and in 0% of patients with RA and PsA. In general, concomitant corticosteroid therapy decreased with time in patients with RA (Fig. S5), especially in naïve patients (from 45% at M6 to 30% at M12), while it remained relatively stable in switched patients (22% at M6 and 17% at M24). In patients with AS, concomitant corticosteroid therapy was maintained (14% at M6 and M24 in naive patients and 8% and 7%, respectively, in switched patients). In patients with PsA, corticosteroid therapy remained stable in naïve patients (14% at M6 and 11% at M24) but decreased with time in switched patients (16% at M6 and 6% at M24). Discussion ReFLECT is one of the largest observational studies conducted in French centers to evaluate CT-P13 treatment persistence after 2 years of follow-up in patients with rheumatic disease or IBD who were either naive to IFX or had been previously treated with IFX originator or another IFX biosimilar. Overall, 60.8% of patients with rheumatic disease remained on CT-P13 treatment after 2 years of follow-up, including 49.6%, 62.7%, and 73.0% of patients with RA, AS, and PsA, respectively. Treatment persistence rates with CT-P13 in our study are broadly comparable with previous reports for IFX [ 15 – 21 ]. Observational studies including patients with rheumatic disease receiving IFX as first- or later-line treatment have reported 2-year persistence rates of 42–65%, 37–70%, and 42–58% for patients with RA, AS/axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), and PsA, respectively [ 15 – 21 ]. CT-P13 persistence rates in the current study are higher than 2-year rates reported in PERSIST (overall: 47.9%; RA: 44.4%; AS: 50.0%; PsA: 50.6%), an observational cohort study of patients with rheumatic disease who were biologic-naive or switched from originator IFX to CT-P13 [ 22 ]. This may reflect differences between studies in patient populations and/or how persistence was defined. It is not possible to directly compare the efficacy of CT-P13 in different inflammatory diseases with different criteria for efficacy. Nonetheless, given the limited therapeutic options available at the time, especially for patients with AS and PsA, physicians may have been more inclined to maintain patients on CT-P13 rather than consider switching. Therefore, many patients with AS were fully controlled and satisfied with IV treatment administered every 6 weeks, favoring drug maintenance, which may explain why persistence was higher in patients with AS than in patients with RA. The mean dose of CT-P13 in RA is usually lower (3 mg/kg) because of recommended posology than in AS or PsA (5 mg/kg). Furthermore, the time since diagnosis appears to be longer in RA than in AS. Multiple studies have investigated real-life switching from originator IFX to CT-P13 in patients with rheumatic disease [ 23 – 27 ]. The DANBIO registry and Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register (SRQ) studies, both including patients with rheumatic disease who switched from IFX originator to CT-P13 for non-medical reasons, reported 1-year retention rates of 84.1% (RA: 81%; PsA: 86%; AxSpA: 87%) and 93%, respectively [ 24 , 25 ]. Single-center cohort studies in patients with rheumatic disease who were systematically switched from originator IFX to CT-P13 have reported persistence rates of 72% (median follow-up: 33 weeks) [ 27 ], 74% (median follow-up: 34 weeks) [ 23 ], and 87% (after two years follow-up) [ 26 ]. Two-year treatment persistence rates for IFX-switched patients in the current study (RA: 65.4%; AS: 66.5%; PsA: 75.9%) were somewhat lower than those reported in the DANBIO and SRQ studies [ 24 , 25 ] and in one single-center cohort study [ 26 ]. This may reflect differences in patient populations and/or study design. Overall, CT-P13 treatment persistence in the current study was higher for IFX-switched (67.4%) than IFX-naive (52.1%) patients. This finding is consistent with the SRQ study [ 24 ] and a post-marketing surveillance study of CT-P13 in Japanese patients with RA [ 28 ], both of which reported higher 1-year treatment retention in patients who switched from originator IFX to CT-P13 (84–93%) for non-medical reasons than in patients who initiated originator IFX or CT-P13 for the first time (55–67%) [ 24 , 28 ]. This same pattern of results was observed in the non-interventional PERFUSE study of patients with RA, PsA, or AxSpA who initiated SB2 as their first IFX treatment (IFX-naive) or who switched from originator IFX or another IFX biosimilar to SB2 (IFX ref and IFX bs, respectively) [ 29 ]. In that study, 1-year persistence rates were higher for IFX ref (75–87%) and IFX bs (80–85%) patients than for IFX-naive patients (56–64%) [ 29 ]. Interestingly, in a retrospective analysis of 5-year drug survival with CT-P13, treatment persistence was similar between patients who started CT-P13 as their first IFX treatment (RA: 41.2%; AS: 63.5%) and those who switched from originator IFX to CT-P13 for non-medical reasons (RA: 52.9%; AS: 72.1%) [ 30 ]. Collectively, these results suggest higher persistence in patients who are on stable and effective IFX treatment before switching to a biosimilar. Additional objectives of ReFLECT were to characterize the patient population receiving CT-P13 and describe the prescribing practices and safety of CT-P13 in a real-world setting. In our study, between 45.8% and 49.3% of patients with rheumatic disease were naive to previous IFX treatments. Sociodemographic and disease characteristics at inclusion were generally similar between IFX-naive and IFX-switched patients, except for longer disease duration in the IFX-switched versus IFX-naive groups and more active disease in the IFX-naive versus IFX-switched groups. Most (72.5–80.2%) patients were already on CT-P13 at inclusion, and among these patients, IFX-naive groups had more active disease than IFX-switched groups (e.g., higher CRP concentrations and disease-specific activity scores). Concomitant or previous corticosteroid use in the last 2 months before inclusion was lower in patients with AS and PsA (9.2% and 14.6% respectively) than in patients with RA (41.5%). This reflects current European treatment recommendations, where corticosteroid therapy is part of the initial treatment strategy or used as temporary adjunctive treatment in RA to control inflammation or during disease flares. Corticosteroid use also declined in all cohorts over time. Patients are recommended to taper glucocorticoids and eventually discontinue them when in remission or low disease activity due to bDMARD treatment. The safety profile of CT-P13 in patients with rheumatic disease has been well established in randomized controlled trials [ 8 – 10 , 31 , 32 ]. This real-world study of CT-P13 did not identify any new safety issues. Overall, 56.4% of patients with rheumatic disease reported ≥ 1 AE, and SAEs (11.9%) and AEs with possible relationship to CT-P13 (24.5%) occurred less frequently. These findings are comparable to those of NOR-SWITCH [ 8 – 10 ] and consistent with other observational studies of CT-P13 in patients with rheumatic disease (AE: 26–76%; SAE: 3–15%; treatment-related AE: 14–29%) [ 22 , 28 , 33 , 34 ]. The most frequently reported specific AEs for all patients in ReFLECT with rheumatic disease were infections (4.9–7.7%) and perfusion reactions (1.0–3.5%), which are within the range reported in other observational studies (0–19% and 2–13%, respectively) and consistent with the known safety profile of IFX [ 22 , 33 – 35 ]. The strengths of this study are its multicenter design and large sample size of patients with rheumatic disease ( N = 649). Additionally, there was low attrition (e.g., patients lost to follow-up or who withdrew consent or decided to withdraw from the study), and the length of study follow-up (2 years) allowed for collecting long-term efficacy and safety data. However, this study was limited by its noninterventional design, which resulted in some data not being well collected or missing data. For example, disease-specific activity scores (e.g., HAQ and ASDAS) were not documented in all patients. Another inherent limitation of the non-randomized design of the study is the potential for confounding bias, which impacts its internal validity. Furthermore, a subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2019–2020 [ 2 ] after the completion of this study. Subcutaneous CT-P13 has demonstrated similar efficacy to intravenous CT-P13 [ 36 , 37 ]. Further studies are required to determine whether the convenience of subcutaneous CT-P13 administration can impact treatment persistence. Conclusions This study allowed for the characterization of patients with rheumatic disease who were treated with CT-P13 in a real-world setting. CT-P13 induced effective therapeutic maintenance in patients with RA, AS, or PsA receiving IFX for the first time and maintained sustained disease control in patients who switched from previous IFX treatments to CT-P13. This real-world study did not highlight any new safety concerns. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

  "plain_text": "Introduction ReFLECT was a French multicenter, observational cohort study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CT-P13, an infliximab (IFX) biosimilar, in a real-world setting. Here, we describe the results for patients with rheumatic disease. Methods Eligible patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were recruited and received intravenous CT-P13 induction and/or maintenance therapy. Patients were either naive to IFX (IFX-naive) or had been previously treated with IFX originator or another IFX biosimilar (IFX-switched). CT-P13 persistence (primary objective) was measured as a time-dependent variable during a 2-year follow-up period. Safety was also assessed. Results The patient population comprised 142 patients with RA (IFX-naive: n = 70; IFX-switched: n = 69; other [i.e., previously received IFX, but received another treatment before switching to CT-P13]: n = 3); 411 patients with AS (IFX-naive: n = 189; IFX-switched; n = 201; other: n = 21); and 96 patients with PsA (IFX-naive: n = 44; IFX-switched: n = 47; other: n = 5). After 2 years of follow-up, CT-P13 persistence rates were 49.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40.4–60.8%), 62.7% (95% CI 56.6–69.5%), and 73.0% (95% CI 62.7–85.1%) in patients with RA, AS, and PsA, respectively. CT-P13 persistence was greater for IFX-switched than IFX-naive groups in patients with RA (65.4% [95% CI 52.8–81.0%] vs. 33.3% [22.7–49.1%]) and AS (66.5% [95% CI 58.3–76.0%] vs. 56.6% [47.6–67.4%]) and was similar between IFX-switched and IFX-naive groups in patients with PsA (75.9% [95% CI 62.2–92.8%] vs. 72.0% [57.5–90.1%]). The main reason for CT-P13 discontinuation was loss of response (RA/AS/PsA) in both IFX-naive (38.6%/23.3%/22.7%) and IFX-switched 18.8%/18.4%/12.8%) groups. Among patients (RA, AS, and PsA), 52.1%, 57.9%, and 56.3%, respectively, reported ≥ 1 adverse event (AE), and 14.1%, 11.4%, and 10.4%, respectively, reported serious AEs. Conclusion After 2 years of follow-up, the effectiveness of intravenous CT-P13 was maintained in > 65% of IFX-switched patients and CT-P13 induced effective therapeutic maintenance in IFX-naive patients. CT-P13 had an acceptable safety profile. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02925338.

CT-P13 is an infliximab biosimilar used to treat patients with rheumatic diseases. This study looked at how effective and safe CT-P13 was in a real-life setting in patients with rheumatic diseases. We studied 142 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 411 with ankylosing spondylitis, and 96 with psoriatic arthritis who were living in France and were prescribed CT-P13 as their first infliximab treatment (infliximab-naive) or switched from the original infliximab biologic or another infliximab biosimilar to CT-P13 (infliximab-switched). Two years after CT-P13 initiation, 49.6% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 62.7% with ankylosing spondylitis, and 73.0% with psoriatic arthritis were still taking CT-P13. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, more infliximab-switched (65.4−66.5%) than infliximab-naive (33.3−56.6%) patients continued taking CT-P13 2 years after starting treatment. Around the same percentage of infliximab-switched (75.9%) and infliximab-naive (72.0%) patients with psoriatic arthritis continued taking CT-P13 2 years after starting treatment. If CT-P13 treatment was discontinued, it was mainly because of loss of response. Corticosteroid use generally decreased with time in all patients with rheumatoid disease. Most (52.1−57.9%) patients with rheumatic diseases reported at least one adverse event, but few (10.4−14.1%) reported any serious adverse events. CT-P13 is an effective and safe treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases, regardless of whether patients take CT-P13 as their first infliximab treatment or switch from another infliximab treatment to CT-P13.
