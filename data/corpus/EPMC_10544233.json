  "abstract_text": "The common neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, plays an important role in several cellular signaling cascades, including that leading to apoptosis. FAP-1 (Fas-associated phosphatase-1), which binds to the cytoplasmic tail of Fas, was originally identified as a negative regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Here we have shown by co-immunoprecipitation that FAP-1 also binds to the p75(NTR) cytoplasmic domain in vivo through the interaction between the third PDZ domain of FAP-1 and C-terminal Ser-Pro-Val residues of p75(NTR). Furthermore, cells expressing a FAP-1/green fluorescent protein showed intracellular co-localization of FAP-1 and p75(NTR) at the plasma membrane. To elucidate the functional role of this physical interaction, we examined TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6)-mediated NF-kappaB activation and tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in 293T cells expressing p75(NTR). The results revealed that TRAF6-mediated NF-kappaB activation was suppressed by p75(NTR) and that the p75(NTR)-mediated NF-kappaB suppression was reduced by FAP-1 expression. Interestingly, a mutant of the p75(NTR) intracellular domain with a single substitution of a Met for Val in its C-terminus, which cannot interact with FAP-1, displayed enhanced pro-apoptotic activity in 293T transfected cells. Thus, similar to Fas, FAP-1 may be involved in suppressing p75(NTR)-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling through its interaction with three C-terminal amino acids (tSPV). Thus, FAP-1 may regulate p75(NTR)-mediated signal transduction by physiological interaction through its third PDZ domain.",
