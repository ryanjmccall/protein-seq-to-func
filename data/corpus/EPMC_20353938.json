  "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), a major regulator of endocrine actions of IGFs, is a p53-regulated potent apoptotic factor and is significantly suppressed in a variety of cancers. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that IGFBP-3 contributes to cancer risk protection in a variety of cancers, and a polymorphic variation of IGFBP-3 influences cancer risk, although other studies vary in their conclusions. Some antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 have been reported to be independent of IGFs, but the precise biochemical/molecular mechanisms of IGF-independent, antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 are largely unknown. Here we report a new cell death receptor, IGFBP-3R, that is a single-span membrane protein and binds specifically to IGFBP-3 but not other IGFBP species. Expression analysis of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3R indicates that the IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis is impaired in breast and prostate cancer. We also provide evidence for anti-tumor effect of IGFBP-3R in vivo using prostate and breast cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice. Further in vitro studies demonstrate that IGFBP-3R mediates IGFBP-3-induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in various cancer cells. Knockdown of IGFBP-3R attenuated IGFBP-3-induced caspase activities and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of IGFBP-3R enhanced IGFBP-3 biological effects. IGFBP-3R physically interacts and activates caspase-8, and knockdown of caspase-8 expression or activity inhibited IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R-induced apoptosis. Here, we propose that IGFBP-3R represents a novel cell death receptor and is essential for the IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis and tumor suppression. Thus, the IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis may provide therapeutic and prognostic value for the treatment of cancer.",
