  "abstract_text": "Glucocorticoids play an important role in the treatment of a number of hematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma. The effects of glucocorticoids are mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor alpha, the abundance of which can be modulated by alternative splicing of the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA. Two splice variants of the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA have been described: glucocorticoid receptor beta, which reportedly has a dominant negative effect on the actions of the glucocorticoid receptor alpha, and glucocorticoid receptor P, of which the effects are unknown. In this study, we have investigated the expression levels of these two splice variants at the mRNA level in multiple myeloma cells and in a number of other hematological tumors. Although the glucocorticoid receptor beta mRNA was, if at all, expressed at very low levels, considerable amounts (up to 50% of the total glucocorticoid receptor mRNA) glucocorticoid receptor P mRNA was present in most hematological malignancies. In transient transfection studies in several cell types and in multiple myeloma cell lines, the glucocorticoid receptor P increased the activity of the glucocorticoid receptor alpha. These results suggest that the relative levels of the glucocorticoid receptor alpha and the glucocorticoid receptor P may play a role in the occurrence of glucocorticoid resistance in tumor cells during the treatment of hematological malignancies with glucocorticoids.",
