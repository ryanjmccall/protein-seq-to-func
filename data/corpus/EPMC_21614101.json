    "abstract_text": "Although the cell cycle machinery is essentially linked to cellular proliferation, recent findings suggest that neuronal cell death is frequently concurrent with the aberrant expression of cell cycle proteins in post-mitotic neurons. The present work reviews the evidence of cell cycle reentry and expression of cell cycle-associated proteins as a complex response of neurons to insults in the adult brain but also as a mechanism underlying brain plasticity. The basic aspects of cell cycle mechanisms, as well as the evidence showing cell cycle protein expression in the injured brain, are reviewed. The discussion includes recent experimental work attempting to establish a correlation between altered brain plasticity and neuronal death, and an analysis of recent evidence on how neural cell cycle dysregulation is related to neurodegenerative diseases especially the Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the mechanisms that control reexpression of proteins required for cell cycle progression which is involved in brain remodeling, may shed new light into the mechanisms involved in neuronal demise under diverse pathological circumstances. This would provide valuable clues about the possible therapeutic targets, leading to potential treatment of presently challenging neurodegenerative diseases.",
