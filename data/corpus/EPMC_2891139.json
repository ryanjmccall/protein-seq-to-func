  "abstract_text": "Recently we described a full-length cDNA for the human nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Here, we report the chromosomal localization and partial map of the human gene for this enzyme as well as the complete coding sequence for this protein. The nucleotide sequence reveals a single 3042-base open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted Mr of 113,135. A comparison of this deduced amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequence of three peptides derived from human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase revealed a match of 27 amino acid residues. A computer-derived structural analysis of the enzyme and a search for similarities with other proteins confirmed that the polymerase belongs to a subfamily of DNA/NAD-binding proteins and DNA-repair proteins. Possible Zn2+-binding \"fingers,\" a nucleotide-binding fold, and a nuclear transport signal were noted. Additionally, chromosomal mapping has identified polymerase-hybridizing sequences on human chromosomes 1 (the active gene), 13, and 14 (processed pseudogenes). Using the polymerase cDNA as a probe, we also have detected several DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms in normal humans.",
