    "abstract_text": "DNA topoisomerase (topo) II mediates DNA strand passage in an ATP-dependent reaction. Human cell lines express at least two genetically distinct forms of the enzyme, topo II alpha (p170) and II beta (p180). Previously, we isolated a novel HeLa cDNA clone (CAA5) that partially encodes a protein homologous to topo II alpha (Austin, C.A. and Fisher, L.M. (1990) FEBS Lett. 266, 115-117). In this paper we show that CAA5 encodes a C-terminal segment of human topo II beta. We report here for the first time cDNA clones spanning the entire coding sequence. Overlapping clones specifying the 3' end of the cDNA have been isolated, mapped and sequenced. The missing 5' coding sequence was obtained by an inverse PCR protocol and from a specifically primed cDNA library. Human topo II beta is a 1621 amino acid protein which is closely homologous to topo II alpha in the N-terminal three quarters of its sequence. In contrast, the C-terminal segments of the alpha and beta sequences show considerable divergence suggesting these regions may mediate different cellular functions of the two isoforms. Southern blot analysis of yeast and Drosophila DNA using human alpha and beta specific probes detected a single topo II homologue in these lower eukaryotes. Comparison of the protein sequence for human topo II beta with other type II topoisomerases revealed several conserved motifs and has allowed identification of the likely ATPase- and DNA breakage-reunion domains.",
