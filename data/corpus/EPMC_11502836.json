    "abstract_text": "G to A transition at position 6664 of the GH-1 gene results in the substitution of Arg183 by His (R183H) in human GH protein and causes a new form of autosomal dominant isolated GH deficiency (type II). Although a weak GH release after standard pharmacological provocation tests is observed in these affected individuals, the dominant inheritance pattern is postulated to be caused by a blockade of the GH-regulated secretion in the somatotrophs. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of this autosomal dominant mutation not only at a clinical, but also at a cellular, level. The results of the different stimulation tests showed first that the patient possesses a severely impaired, but releasable, GH store, and second that the GH secretion is blocked in a time-dependent and reversible way. To confirm these clinical data, cell culture studies were performed looking at the regulated secretory pathway of GH using AtT-20 cells. Importantly, we were able to show that when the R183H mutant GH was expressed in AtT-20 cells, secretagogue (forskolin) induced a normal R183H GH-regulated secretion, but in AtT-20 cells coexpressing both the R183H mutant GH and the normal GH, forskolin-induced GH secretion was markedly reduced. Together, the experiments seem to support the hypothesis that R183H mutant GH severely impaired the GH-regulated secretion and may, therefore, be the cause of this specific form of isolated GH deficiency type II.",
