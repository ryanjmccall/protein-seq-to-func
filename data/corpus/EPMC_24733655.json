    "abstract_text": "Lipids play crucial roles in cell signaling and various physiological processes, especially in the brain. Impaired lipid metabolism in the brain has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other central nervous system insults. The brain contains thousands of lipid species, but the complex lipid compositional diversity and the function of each of lipid species are currently poorly understood. This review integrates current knowledge about major lipid changes with the molecular mechanisms that underlie AD pathogenesis.",
