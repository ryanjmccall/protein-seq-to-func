    "abstract_text": "We report here the role of one of the less studied members of the family of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), namely SOCS-7, in cytokine signaling. We demonstrate that SOCS-7 inhibits prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), or leptin (LEP) signaling mediated through STAT3 and STAT5 in a dose-dependent manner. SOCS-7 also attenuated STAT3 and STAT5 signaling induced by overexpression of JH1, the catalytic subdomain of JAK2. Since SOCS-7 interacted with phosphorylated STAT3 or STAT5, we assumed that SOCS-7 acts at the level of STAT proteins. Indeed, we showed that SOCS-7 inhibits PRL- and leptin-induced STAT5 and STAT3 phosphorylation and prevented the nuclear translocation of activated STAT3. Taken together, our results indicate that SOCS-7 is a physiological dysregulator of PRL, leptin, and probably also GH signaling and that its mode of action is a novel variation of SOCS protein inhibition of cytokine-inducible STAT-mediated signal transduction.",
