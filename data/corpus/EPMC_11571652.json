  "abstract_text": "The ubiquitin pathway is involved in the proteolytic turnover of many short-lived cellular regulatory proteins. Since selective degradation of substrates of this system requires the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to the substrates, degradation could be counteracted by de-ubiquitinating enzymes (or isopeptidases) which selectively remove the polyubiquitin chain. Unp is a human isopeptidase with still poorly understood biological functions. Here, we show that cellular Unp specifically interacts with the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb).",
