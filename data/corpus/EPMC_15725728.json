    "abstract_text": "Netrins and their classical receptors--DCC and neogenin--play key roles in neuronal guidance. Recent developments identify new roles for netrins in epithelial and vascular morphogenesis. Netrins accomplish these effects, at least in part, through binding to integrins and/or activating integrin-associated kinases such as FAK and Fyn. Here we discuss these recent findings and propose that integrins and classical netrin receptors cooperate to regulate multiple aspects of development.",
