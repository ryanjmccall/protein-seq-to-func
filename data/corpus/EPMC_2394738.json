    "abstract_text": "S100 protein is a low molecular weight, EF-hand, Ca2(+)-binding protein widely distributed and conserved in the central nervous system of vertebrates. The gene coding for the beta subunit of human S100 protein (S100 beta) has been recently mapped to chromosome 21. In order to study the expression of this gene in normal and abnormal brain development, we have isolated and characterized overlapping genomic clones spanning the region coding for human S100 beta and its flanking sequences. The intron-exon organization of the human S100 beta gene is similar to that of the genes coding for several other members of the S100 protein subfamily of EF-hand proteins. The human S100 beta gene is composed of 3 exons, the first of which specifies the 5'-untranslated region, while the second and third each encode a single EF-hand, Ca2(+)-binding domain. The promoter region contains several potential regulatory transcription elements including the cAMP-responsive elements CRE and AP-2. A novel sequence motif, the S100 protein element, situated in close proximity to the TATA box of the genes of several members of the S100 protein subfamily, has been identified. In addition, multiple repeats with similar nucleotide sequence and location to the recently reported beta globin direct repeat elements have been also found in the human S100 beta promoter. A full length (17.3 kilobases) copy of the human S100 beta gene was constructed and transfected into rat glioma C6 cells. Stable transfectants were shown to express correctly initiated transcripts of the human S100 beta gene, indicating that the cloned sequences contain functional regulatory transcription elements.",
