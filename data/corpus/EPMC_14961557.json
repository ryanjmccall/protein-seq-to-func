  "title": "A novel PTPN11 mutation in LEOPARD syndrome.",
  "year": 2003,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/14961557",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "PTPN11 gene mutations are common to both patients with Noonan (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS). So far only two recurrent mutations have been identified in LS patients by different research groups, i.e., Tyr279Cys and Thr468Met. In this work we describe the third PTPN11 mutation that has been found in a single LS patient. The mutation (c.1517A>C) substitutes a proline for a glutamine at amino acid 506 (Gln506Pro) in the phosphatase domain (PTP) of the PTPN11 peptide SHP2. This region is a mutation hotspot. Changes at amino acids 501 to 504 cause NS. Gln506Pro is predicted, by modeling analysis, to seriously disrupt the normal contacts between the regulating N-SH2 and the active PTP domains, leading to hyperactivity of the phosphatase. This report demonstrates that rarer mutations other than Tyr279Cys and Thr468Met can be found in LS patients and the need of screening the whole gene in those negative for the commonest mutations.",
