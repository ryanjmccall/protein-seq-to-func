    "abstract_text": "The efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is closely associated with genome stability and tumor response to chemotherapy. While many factors have been functionally characterized in HR, such as TOPBP1, their precise regulation remains unclear. Here, we report that TOPBP1 interacts with the RNA-binding protein HTATSF1 in a cell-cycle- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, CK2 phosphorylates HTATSF1 to facilitate binding to TOPBP1, which promotes S-phase-specific TOPBP1 recruitment to damaged chromatin and subsequent RPA/RAD51-dependent HR, genome integrity, and cancer-cell viability. The localization of HTATSF1-TOPBP1 to DSBs is potentially independent of the transcription-coupled RNA-binding and processing capacity of HTATSF1 but rather relies on the recognition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated RPA by HTATSF1, which can be blunted with PARP inhibitors. Together, our study provides a mechanistic insight into TOPBP1 loading at HR-prone DSB sites via HTATSF1 and reveals how RPA-RAD51 exchange is tuned by a PARylation-phosphorylation cascade.",
