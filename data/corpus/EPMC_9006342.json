    "abstract_text": "Cell adhesion kinase-beta (CAK-beta) is a protein tyrosine kinase of the focal adhesion kinase subfamily, which contains large amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. We studied the tissue distribution of CAK-beta and its mRNA by immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization. In rat brain, CAK-beta was mainly found in the medulla whereas CAK-beta mRNA was expressed in most neurons, especially pyramidal cells and Purkinje cells. In the small intestine, CAK-beta protein and mRNA were detected in the absorptive epithelial cells, and the protein was concentrated in the brush border. Double immunostaining for CAK-beta and actin showed that they co-localized in the brush border of small intestine cells. Immunoelectron micrography revealed that the anti-CAK-beta antibody localized within microvilli. In the kidney, the protein was mainly expressed in proximal tubular cells, which have well developed microvilli, although CAK-beta mRNA was observed in most urinary tubular cells. In other tissues, the ciliated cells of the epididymis strongly expressed CAK-beta mRNA and CAK-beta localized in the cilia. In addition, alpha- and beta-tubulin were identified in the rat brain lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-CAK-beta antibody. The present results demonstrate that CAK-beta is present at relatively high levels in cilia, axons, and microvilli. This suggests that CAK-beta may play important roles in the functions of these structures or that the CAK-beta-related signaling pathway is closely associated with cytoskeletal components.",
