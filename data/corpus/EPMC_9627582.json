  "title": "Inherited and de novo androgen receptor gene mutations: investigation of single-case families.",
  "year": 1998,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/9627582",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study was to assess somatic and inherited androgen receptor gene mutations in families with only one affected individual.<h4>Methods</h4>Molecular genetic analysis of the androgen receptor gene in DNA derived from blood leukocytes from 30 families with single-strand conformation analysis, direct sequencing, and restriction fragment analysis was performed.<h4>Results</h4>In 22 families the mothers and all investigated grandmothers were heterozygous carriers. However, within the sisters and aunts, both heterozygous carriers and noncarriers were present. In eight families a de novo mutation was characterized. In three of these patients indication for somatic mosaicism was found.<h4>Conclusions</h4>De novo mutations occur at a high rate within the androgen receptor gene (8 of 30 = 26.7%); a high proportion (3 of 8) arise after the zygote stage. Thus only direct analysis of the underlying mutation of the androgen receptor gene in the proband and his or her family can provide the basis for genetic counseling.",
