  "abstract_text": "Protein aggregation and misfolding characterize most age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. Protein aggregation has generally been assumed to be responsible for neurodegeneration in these disorders due to association and genetics. However, protein aggregation may, in fact, be an attempt to protect neurons from the stress resulting from the disease etiology. In this review, we weigh the evidence of whether removal of amyloids, aggregates and neuronal inclusions represent a reasonable strategy for protecting neurons.",
