  "title": "Three-dimensional structure of class pi glutathione S-transferase from human placenta in complex with S-hexylglutathione at 2.8 A resolution.",
  "year": 1992,

  "abstract_text": "The three-dimensional structure of human class pi glutathione S-transferase from placenta (hGSTP1-1), a homodimeric enzyme, has been solved by Patterson search methods and refined at 2.8 A resolution to a final crystallographic R-factor of 19.6% (8.0 to 2.8 A resolution). Subunit folding topology, subunit overall structure and subunit association closely resembles the structure of porcine class pi glutathione S-transferase. The binding site of a competitive inhibitor, S-hexylglutathione, is analyzed and the locations of the binding regions for glutathione (G-site) and electrophilic substrates (H-site) are determined. The specific interactions between protein and the inhibitor's glutathione peptide are the same as those observed between glutathione sulfonate and the porcine isozyme. The H-site is located adjacent to the G-site, with the hexyl moiety lying above a segment (residues 8 to 10) connecting strand beta 1 and helix alpha A where it is in hydrophobic contact with Tyr7, Phe8, Val10, Val35 and Tyr106. Catalytic models are discussed on the basis of the molecular structure.",
