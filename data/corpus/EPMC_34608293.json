    "abstract_text": "Spindle position control is essential for cell fate determination and organogenesis. Early studies indicate the essential role of the evolutionarily conserved G\u03b1i/LGN/NuMA network in spindle positioning. However, the regulatory mechanisms that couple astral microtubules dynamics to the spindle orientation remain elusive. Here we delineated a new mitosis-specific crotonylation-regulated astral microtubule-EB1-NuMA interaction in mitosis. EB1 is a substrate of TIP60, and TIP60-dependent crotonylation of EB1 tunes accurate spindle positioning in mitosis. Mechanistically, TIP60 crotonylation of EB1 at Lys66 forms a dynamic link between accurate attachment of astral microtubules to the lateral cell cortex defined by NuMA-LGN and fine tune of spindle positioning. Real-time imaging of chromosome movements in HeLa cells expressing genetically encoded crotonylated EB1 revealed the importance of crotonylation dynamics for accurate control of spindle orientation during metaphase-anaphase transition. These findings delineate a general signaling cascade that integrates protein crotonylation with accurate spindle positioning for chromosome stability in mitosis.",
