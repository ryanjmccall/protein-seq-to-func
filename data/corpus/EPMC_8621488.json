    "abstract_text": "Through the specific binding of a negative calcium-responsive element to its binding protein in response to extracellular Ca (Ca2+e), negative calcium-responsive element-bearing genes, such as the human parathyroid hormone gene, are negatively regulated by Ca2+e. The Ku antigen mediated negative gene regulation by Ca2+e by interacting with a redox factor protein, REF1. Although sequence-nonspecific DNA binding activity of the Ku antigen has been well characterized, the mechanism of its sequence-specific DNA binding remained obscure. Here, we report that the specific binding of the Ku antigen to another protein, REF1, leads to DNA-protein complex formation with a novel sequence specificity and thereby regulates gene expression.",
