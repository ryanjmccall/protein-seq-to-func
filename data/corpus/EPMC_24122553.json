  "abstract_text": "Human DNAJC12 is a J domain-containing protein whose regulation, subcellular localization, and function are currently unknown. We show here that the abundance of DNAJC12 in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells is upregulated by the stress-inducing drug A23187 and by the stressregulated transcription factor AIbZIP/CREB3L4. The DNAJC12 gene encodes two isoforms, only one of which (isoform a) is expressed in these cells. Immunofluorescence studies showed that a recombinant DNAJC12 protein is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. To identify substrates of DNAJC12, we used an immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry approach in cells that express epitope-tagged DNAJC12. The list of potential DNAJC12-binding proteins that were identified in this screen includes several nucleotide-binding proteins. The most frequently identified partner of DNAJC12 in unstressed cells was Hsc70, a cognate Hsp70 chaperone, whereas in stressed cells, the ER chaperone BiP was frequently associated with DNAJC12. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the endogenous DNAJC12 and Hsc70 proteins interact in LNCaP cells. These results clarify the role of DNAJC12 in the regulation of Hsp70 function.",
