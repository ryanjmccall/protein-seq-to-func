    "abstract_text": "The metabolic actions of insulin are transduced through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. A critical component of this pathway is 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), a PH domain-containing enzyme that catalyzes the activating phosphorylation for many AGC kinases, including Akt and protein kinase C isozymes. We used a directed proteomics-based approach to identify the adaptor protein Grb14, which binds the insulin receptor through an SH2 domain, as a novel PDK-1 binding partner. Interaction of these two proteins is constitutive and mediated by a PDK-1 binding motif on Grb14. Disruption of this motif by point mutation or deletion of the Grb14 SH2 domain prevents the insulin-triggered membrane translocation of PDK-1. The interaction of PDK-1 with Grb14 facilitates Akt function: disruption of the interaction by overexpression of a construct of Grb14 mutated in the PDK-1 binding motif significantly decreases insulin-dependent activation of Akt. Thus, Grb14 serves as an adaptor protein to recruit PDK-1 to activated insulin receptor, thus promoting Akt phosphorylation and transduction of the insulin signal.",
