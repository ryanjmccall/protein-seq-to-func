Keywords Vascular endothelial growth factor Oral squamous cell carcinoma Extracellular vesicles Bevacizumab Heparan sulfate proteoglycans issue-copyright-statement \u00a9 BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024 Introduction According to the data of World Health Organization\u2019s Globocan project, OSCC was ranked 18th among male patients and 17th among female patients in all 36 types of tumors, and the yearly prevalence of OSCC is increasing globally [ 1 , 2 ]. Despite years of development, there are various treatment options for OSCC patients, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but the prognosis of patients is still poor, and the overall five-year survival rate is only about 50% [ 3 , 4 ]. Several studies have indicated that OSCC tissue exhibits high microvascular density (MVD) [ 5 \u2013 7 ], creating a favorable environment for tumor growth and metastasis in patients with OSCC. In light of the high MVD characteristics of OSCC tissue, it may be beneficial to explore targeted novel treatment options as a potential direction for improving prognosis in OSCC patients. Angiogenesis is the biological process by which new blood vessels are generated from pre-existing vessels [ 8 ]. To sustain the rapid proliferation of cancer cells, tumors necessitate efficient and swift formation of new vascular networks. The formation of tumor blood vessels is partially driven by aberrant levels of growth factors secreted by tumor and stromal cells, including VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and angiopoietins, with VEGF playing a pivotal role [ 9 ]. VEGF is a homodimeric glycoprotein that regulates vascular formation and has over 20 isoforms. The key isoforms\u2014VEGF 121 , VEGF 165 , and VEGF 189 \u2014differ in their heparin-binding abilities [ 10 \u2013 13 ]. Overexpression of VEGF is strongly correlated with increased MVD in OSCC tissues [ 5 ]. Therefore, the main therapeutic focus has been on the major pro-angiogenic stimulus VEGF. However, the efficacy of VEGF-targeting drugs is limited [ 14 ], which may be attributed to the complex nature of VEGF proteins. EVs are membrane-bound particles produced by cells and released into the extracellular space. EVs extract waste components from the cell, are capable of distributing nutrition, and function as intercellular messengers through the transport and dissemination of bioactive enzymes, molecules, and molecular signals [ 15 ]. Emerging studies suggest that tumor-derived EVs play a crucial role in regulating angiogenesis by transferring a variety of components, including non-coding RNAs like circular RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, and proteins [ 16 \u2013 19 ]. In addition, a substantial body of research has also revealed the significant contribution of EVs in promoting tolerance to anti-angiogenesis therapy [ 20 \u2013 23 ]. VEGF was found in EVs secreted by cells including colon cancer, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer, depending on the cell type, the link between EVs and VEGF can be mediated by HSPG, HSP90, or CD63, and VEGF carried by EVs demonstrated tolerance to the humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab [ 24 \u2013 26 ]. Although previous studies have demonstrated that VEGF carried by EVs is resistant to the effects of bevacizumab, a satisfactory clinical solution to this issue has yet to be identified. In this study, EVs isolated from OSCC CM were found to carry VEGF 189 , which demonstrated resistance to bevacizumab, in accordance with previous research. Additional investigations indicated HSPG as the bridging molecule between EVs and VEGF, and a significant factor in EV-VEGF resistance to bevacizumab. As such, the application of HSPG antagonist surfen was considered, and it was found to hinder EV-VEGF angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro experiments. In conclusion, surfen shows promise as a novel therapy for treating particular forms of VEGF, such as EV-VEGF. In light of our discoveries, we aim to study the mechanisms of resistance to anti-VEGF treatment in OSCC and identify effective targeted agents. Methods Human specimen study All studies involving human specimens were approved by Dalian Medical University. The tumor tissue samples of 23 OSCC from patients and 10 normal oral mucosa tissues from patients with no pathological evidence of OSCC were obtained from School of Stomatology, Dalian Medical University. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for diagnosis and evaluating the tissue morphological structure. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of VEGF in these tissues using the streptavidin\u2013biotin complex technique. The procedures are as follows: the specimens were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Following xylene deparaffinization and alcohol rehydration (ranging from 100 to 75%), slides were immersed in the endogenous peroxidase blockers for 10 min, and subsequently treated in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 2 min under pressure cooking for antigen retrieval. Slides were subsequently incubated with Anti-VEGFA antibody 1:100 (ab52917, Abcam) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. On the subsequent day, the sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated secondary antibody (PV-9001, ZSGB-bio). Following extensive washes, the slides were exposed to horseradish peroxidase for 30 min. After washes in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), slides were incubated with the chromogen diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), counterstained with hematoxylin, and sealed with Neutral balsam (G8590, Solarbi). In order to accurately evaluate the assessment of VEGF staining, integrated optical density and area of target distribution were measured with Image Pro \u00ae Plus version 6.0 subsequently computing the average density of each field. Cell culture Two OSCC cell lines, UM-SCC6 and CAL-27, were used in this study. UM-SCC6 was a courtesy of Peking Union Medical University. CAL-27 was purchased from American type culture collection company. Both were squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with CAL-27 exhibiting greater invasiveness and metastatic capability and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Biological Industries, Israel) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biological Industries, Israel), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin (P1400, Solarbio). Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (pHUVEC) cell was isolated from fresh umbilical cord and cultured in endothelial cell medium (ECM, ScienCell, SanDiego, CA) supplemented with 5% FBS (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) and 1% endothelial cell growth factor (ECGS, ScienCell, SanDiego, CA). All cells were cultured at 37\u2103 in 5% CO2. TCGA data analysis The standardized TCGA dataset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues and normal adjacent tissues without any cancer cells were downloaded from the UCSC database ( https://xenabrowser.net/ ). Subsequently, we isolated the expression data of the VEGFA gene from each specimen. To mitigate data skewness and rectify data distribution, we executed a log2(x + 1) transformation on the VEGFA gene expression values of each sample. Ultimately, we computed the mean expression values for each cohort of samples to evaluate the disparity in VEGFA gene expression between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissues and normal tissues. EVs isolation EVs were isolated from CM by following steps. EV-free FBS was obtained by ultracentrifuging FBS for 6 h at 100,000 g. UM-SCC6 or CAL-27 cells were cultured in dishes until the cell density reached about 80%. The cells were washed twice with PBS, replaced with 10 mL 4% EV-free FBS media, and cultured for another 48 h. The CM was collected and centrifuged at 500 g for 15 min and 2,500 g for 25 min to remove cells. The medium was subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min to remove cell debris and large vesicles. Then, the medium was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 2 h. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was re-suspended in 10 mL PBS and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for another 2 h. The pellet (EVs) was finally re-suspended in 100\u2013200 \u00b5L PBS and stored at -80 \u2103. The protein concentration of each EVs sample was determined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (p0010, Beyotime). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) To observe the morphological characterization of EVs, carbon-coated nickel grids were loaded with 20 \u00b5L EVs and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The grids were negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid for 5 min and dried. Observation was achieved by JEM-2000EX TEM (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). For immunogold labeling, grids were blocked by 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) after placed in EVs for 20 min. Then, the grids were incubated with antibodies of CD63 1:10 (ab134045, Abcam), CD9 1:10 (ab263019, Abcam) or VEGF 1:10 (19003-1-AP, Proteintech) for 16 h at 4 \u2103. Next day, the grids were washed three times by PBS contained 0.1% BSA and incubated with Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor\u2122 488\u20135 nm colloidal gold 1:20 (A31565, Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, 5% glutaraldehyde was used to fix the grids for 15 min. Then, the grids were negatively stained and observed under TEM. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) NTA was performed to analyze the particle size distribution of EVs, which was accomplished by ZetaView PMX 110. In brief, the EVs were diluted one-thousand-fold and injected into the instrument. Then, the particle number and size distribution data of EVs were acquired from the instrument software. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Cells were seeded into 6 mm cell culture dishes and lysed with 1 mL Trizol (ET111-01, Transgene) when cell density reached about 80%. Total RNA was isolated from cells according to Trizol extraction method. Reverse transcription process was accomplished by using All-In-One 5X RT MasterMix (G490, abm). About 10 ng cDNA sample was amplified through 30 cycles for \u03b2-actin or 35 cycles for VEGF. The \u03b2-actin forward primer sequence and reverse primer sequence were as follow: forward sequence: CACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC, reverse sequence : AGGTCTTTGCGGATGTCCACGT. VEGF isoforms were detected by using a common forward primer (Exon3F: CCCTGATGAGATCGAGTACATCTT) and reverse primers covering the exon 5 and 7 junction (Exon5/7R: AGCAAGGCCCACAGGGATTT), the exon 5 and 8 junction (Exon5/8R: GCCTCGGCTTGTCACATTTT), exon 6 (Exon6R: AACGCTCCAGGACTTATACCG) or exon 8 (Exon8R: ACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCAC). Immunofluorescence Cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates. When the density reached about 70%, cells were washed twice with PBS, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked in 5% Normal Goat Serum (SL038, Solarbio) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary anti-VEGF 1:100 (19003-1-A, Proteintech) at 4\u2103 overnight. Next day, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Dylight 488 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG 1:200 (A23220, Abbkine) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (C0065, Solarbio) for 5 min at room temperature. Immunoblotting UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates. When cell confluency reached 70-80%, washed twice with cold PBS, 200 \u00b5L RIPA lysis buffer (Solarbio R0010) was added to plates and cells were harvested with scraper. The samples were left on ice for at least 30 min then centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 RPM; the supernatant was collected and added with 5\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer (P1040, Solarbi), boiled for 5 min at 100 \u2103. For EVs samples, EVs suspend in PBS were added with 5\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 5 min at 100 \u2103. Proteins (30 \u00b5g) or EVs (5 \u00b5g) were loaded on 8\u201312% SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically separated, then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (IPFL20200, Millipore). The membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk (D8340, Solarbio) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was blotted with primary antibodies (anti-VEGF 1:500 [19003-1-AP, Proteinteh], anti-GAPDH 1:2000 [10494-1-AP, Proteintech], anti-CD63 1:1000 [ab134045, Abcam], anti-CD9 1:1000 [ab263019, Abcamc], anti-TSG101 1:1000 [ab125011, Abcam], anti-Calnexin 1:1000 [ab133615, Abcam]) at 4 \u2103 overnight. Next day, the membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washed three times with TBST, the chemiluminescence signal was detected using Chemidoc\u00ac\u00acTM Imaging System (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) VEGF concentrations in CM and EVs were estimated according to the manufacturer of EliKineTM Human VEGF ELISA kit (KTE6033, Abbkine). Briefly, 100 \u00b5L CM or EVs (10 \u00b5g) were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, 100 \u00b5L Human VEGF detect antibody (1:100) was added to each well, incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the wells were washed and added with 100 \u00b5L streptavidin \u2013 horseradish (HRP) peroxidase and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After repeating the washing step 100 \u00b5L HRP substrate was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, 50 \u00b5L Stop solution was added to each well to end the reaction. Optical density at 450 nm was obtained by using ELx808TM Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA). The value was calculated according to standard curve. Quantification of unbound bevacizumab A high bind 96-well microplate was coated with rVEGF 165 (12.5 ng/mL). Bevacizumab (10 ng/mL) were pre-incubated with either rVEGF 189 or EVs in volume of 100 \u00b5L at 37 \u25e6C for 2 h. Then the mixture was added into the rVEGF-coated microplate. Then, the wells were washed and added with 100 \u00b5L HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG 1:20,000 (A21050, Abbkine) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Followed by washing and addition of HRP substrate solution, incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, 50 \u00b5L Stop solution was added to each well to end the reaction. Absorbance was read at 450 nm. The concentration of unbound bevacizumab in each reaction was calculated according to the relevant standard curve. Flow cytometry For detecting EV-associated protein, EVs (1 \u00d7 10 9 ) were incubated with AF488 anti-human CD63 1:10 (NHA063-A488, NanoFCM), AF488 anti-human CD9 1:10 (NHA009-A488, NanoFCM) or Human VEGF Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488-conjugated Antibody 1:10 (IC2931G, R&D) for 30 min at 37\u2103.Then, EVs were centrifuged for 70 min at 100,000 g. Pellet was re-suspended in 100 \u00b5L PBS and immediately analyzed using a flow nanoanalyzer (NanoFCM, Xiamen, China). Experiments were performed three times independently. Tube formation assay After thawed on ice overnight at 4 \u2103, 50 \u00b5L Matrigel (082703, BD) was added into 96-well plate and incubated at 37 \u2103 for 1 h. pHUVECs (2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well) with rVEGF 189 (10 ng/mL) or EVs (10 \u00b5g) were seeded into 96-well plate. After 6 h, tube-like structures can be observed and imaged under microscopy. The tube numbers per well were scanned and quantified by Image J. Matrigel-plug angiogenesis assay Matrigel-plug assay was performed to observe angiogenesis in vivo. Matrigel (450 \u00b5L) was mixed with PBS (50 \u00b5L), rVEGF 189 (100 ng/mL) or EVs (100 \u00b5g) with or without bevacizumab (0.25 mg/mL) (HY-P9906, MCE) or surfen (200 \u00b5M) (HY-122704 A, MCE), the mixture was injected subcutaneously into ventral region of BALB/c female nude mice (6 weeks old, n = 4 per group). After 14 days, the mice were anesthetized, Matrigel plugs were collected, fixed in neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin and sliced into 4 \u03bcm. Sections were stained with Masson\u2019s trichrome stain [G1340, Solarbi], which blue part represent Matrigel. Immunohistochemistry for CD34 1:150 [ab81289, Abcam] was carried out to show the positive area in Matrigel. Animal experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee of Dalian Medical University. Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0. The data visualization was accomplished utilizing Graph Pad 8.0. Comparisons between 2 groups were made by student\u2019s t-test. The p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments. Results VEGF isoforms in OSCC To confirm that VEGF exhibits significantly elevated expression levels in OSCC tissues, compared to those in healthy tissues. We evaluated the expression of VEGF in 23 OSCC cases and 10 healthy controls by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 1 A). It was found that VEGF expression showed significantly higher in OSCC cases than that in the controls (Fig. 1 B). Based on mRNA data from the TCGA database regarding HNSCC, it was revealed that the expression of VEGF mRNA was significantly elevated in HNSCC tissues, compared with para cancer tissues (Fig. 1 C). Immunofluorescence qualitative analysis revealed robust cytoplasmic expression of VEGF in UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 cells (Fig. 1 D). Fig. 1 VEGF Expression in OSCC.

To investigate the VEGF isoforms produced by OSCC cells, primers specifically targeting VEGF 121 , VEGF 165 , and VEGF 189 alone and nonspecifically targeting all three VEGF isoforms were designed (Fig. 1 E). The RT-PCR results indicated that all three isoforms were expressed in OSCC cells. VEGF 121 and VEGF 165 exhibited the high expression level, while VEGF 189 expression was lower than both VEGF 121 and VEGF 165 (Fig. 1 F). However, using human recombinant VEGF 121 (rVEGF 121 ), VEGF 165 (rVEGF 165 ), and VEGF 189 (rVEGF 189 ) monomer and dimer as positive controls, western blot analysis only detected the expression of VEGF 165 dimer and VEGF 189 monomer in both OSCC cells (Fig. 1 G). EV-binding and soluble VEGF secreted by OSCC To investigate whether EVs derived from OSCC are associated with VEGF. CM of UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 were collected to assess the EV-binding and non-EV-binding (soluble) VEGF composition secreted by OSCC cells. Cells and debris are deleted through 500 g and 2,500 g centrifugation. The concentration of VEGF in the supernatant was measured and defined as the total VEGF concentration secreted by OSCC cells (Fig. 2 A). Then, the supernatant was submitted to centrifuge at 12,000 g and ultracentrifuge 120,000 g to get EV pellet. As ultracentrifugation is not able to remove all of the EVs in CM, the EV-depleted CM was ultrafiltered utilizing a 100 kDa ultrafiltration tube to remove the remained EVs and obtain the soluble factors with low molecules. The molecular weight of VEGF is about 40 kDa, soluble VEGF was defined as that in the EV-depleted medium and total VEGF was defined as that in the supernatant after 2,500 g centrifugation (Fig. 2 A). The total VEGF concentrations secreted by UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 were 3890 pg/mL and 3083 pg/mL, respectively, while soluble VEGF were 2419 pg/mL and 1417 pg/mL (Fig. 2 B). It is suggested that 62% VEGF secreted by UM-SCC6 was soluble, while 45% VEGF secreted by CAL-27 was soluble (Fig. 2 C). We speculate that most of the non-soluble VEGF was EV-binding subtype.

Western blots analysis demonstrated the expression of CD63, CD9, and TSG101 in both cell lysate and EVs samples. However, the endoplasmic reticulum membrane marker Calnexin was exclusively detected in the cell lysate, but not in EVs (Fig. 3 D). TEM examination showed typical morphological features of EVs from UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 (Fig. 2 E). The particle size distribution of EVs was determined through NTA. It revealed that the EVs showed medians of 94.25 nm and 89.25 nm for UM-SCC6 and CAL-27, respectively (Fig. 2 F). Fig. 3 VEGF 189 present in EVs.

It was discovered that the isoform of EV-VEGF was VEGF 189 , it showed higher expression in CAL-27, and there is also a trace amount of EV-VEGF 165 expressed in CAL-27(Fig. 3 A). Nano-gold labelling and TEM revealed that VEGF was located on the surface of EVs, similar to CD9 and CD63 (Fig. 3 B). Nanoflow cytometry was used to detect EV-binding VEGF. Using CD63 and CD9 as positive controls, the percentage of CD63- and CD9-positive EVs was found to be approximately 30%, while the percentage of VEGF-positive EVs was less than 10% (Fig. 3 C). Next, we measure the stability of EV-VEGF. The half-life of rVEGF 189 is approximately 48 h, whereas that of EV-VEGF exceeds 72 h (Fig. 3 D). It suggests that EV-VEGF exhibits greater stability compared to rVEGF 189 . Sensitivity of EV-VEGF to bevacizumab Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, recognized all VEGF isoforms and impedes their interaction with receptors. Therefore, we tested the angiogenic activity of EV-VEGF and the anti-angiogenic effects of bevacizumab to EV-VEGF. Through experiments involving tubule formation, it is confirmed that EV-VEGF from both OSCC cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent capability to promote angiogenesis (Fig. 4 A). As the aforementioned subtype of EV-VEGF is VEGF 189 , human rVEGF 189 was utilized as a positive control. It was discovered that bevacizumab successfully hindered the formation of tube in rVEGF 189 groups with an inhibition efficiency of approximately 70%. However, no significant inhibitor effects of bevacizumab on EV-VEGF were found (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 4 EV-VEGF is insensitive to bevacizumab.

As shown in Fig. 4 C, rVEGF 189 or EV-VEGF were incubated with bevacizumab firstly and then the unbinding rVEGF 189 or EV-VEGF were measured. It was found that the concentration of VEGF in the rVEGF 189 group was barely detectable, with a binding efficiency of nearly 100%. By contrast, the binding efficiency of the EV-VEGF from both cells to bevacizumab was only about 10% (Fig. 4 C). To further confirm our findings, an ELISA kit for quantitative determination of bevacizumab levels was designed. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the levels of unbound bevacizumab were measured after incubation with different concentrations of rVEGF 189 or EV-VEGF. It was found that the concentration of unbound bevacizumab decreased in a rVEGF 189 -dependent manner, whereas unbound bevacizumab concentration did not show significant changes in the both EV groups (Fig. 4 D). HSPG mediating VEGF binding to EVs HSPGs are a type of molecule that is most closely associated with VEGF. Thereby, we try to determine the potential mediation of HSPG in VEGF binding to EVs. Heparinase I was used to degrade the HS chains of HSPG. The levels of VEGF raised in the supernatants of UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 EVs treated with heparinase (Fig. 5 A). The binding affinity between EV-VEGF and bevacizumab was also been changed by heparinase I. The concentration of unbound bevacizumab was decreased after bevacizumab was incubated with EVs pretreated by heparinase I (Fig. 5 B). Thus, we propose that HSPG facilitates VEGF binding to EV and plays a crucial role in EV-VEGF resistance to bevacizumab. Then the sensitivity of bevacizumab to EV-VEGF plus heparinase I was evaluated through tube-formation assay. It is revealed that bevacizumab in combination with heparinase I significantly inhibited EV-VEGF-induced angiogenesis (Fig. 5 C). Fig. 5 The VEGF 189 in EVs is facilitated by HSPG.

Surfen, a small molecule antagonist of HSPG, may provide a potential solution to this problem. In the presence of surfen, the formation of tubes induced by both UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 EVs was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, bevacizumab in combination with surfen inhibited UM-SCC6 and CAL-27 EV-induced angiogenesis significantly. And the combination effects on anti-angiogenic activity was better than surfen alone (Fig. 6 B). Surfen was known for suppressing rVEGF 121 and rVEGF 165 . Interestingly, our research also suggests that surfen inhibits rVEGF 189 (Fig. 6 B). Fig. 6 Neutralization of EV-VEGF by HSPG antagonist in vitro.

The efficacy of bevacizumab in blocking soluble rVEGF 189 -induced angiogenesis was confirmed in vivo (Fig. 7 A, B). Bevacizumab solely showed a weak inhibitory effect on EV-induced angiogenesis. In contrast, surfen plus bevacizumab significantly reduced the microvessel area and CD34-positive area in the plugs (Fig. 7 A, B). Fig. 7 Neutralization of EV-VEGF by HSPG antagonist in vivo. ( A ) Results of a representative Matrigel-plug angiogenesis assay of rVEGF 189 or UM-SCC6/CAL-27 derived EVs pretreated with surfen or bevacizumab, scale bar = 5 mm(top), 100 \u03bcm(middle and bottom); ( B ) Micro vessel density and CD34-positive area statistics from ( A ); ns, not significant * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 Discussion In addition to being an important information exchange medium in the tumor microenvironment, EVs can also affect the efficiency of treatment against tumors [ 27 ]. For example, OSCC secretes EVs through the miR-503-3p-BAK axis to gain chemotherapy tolerance [ 28 ]. This study demonstrated that OSCC-derived EVs can convey VEGF 189 , which resists bevacizumab as compared to soluble VEGF. This resistance might be due to the EV-VEGF binding with HSPG, which can be overcome by the HSPG antagonist surfen. Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumors. OSCC tissues are rich in blood vessels, and high MVD in tumors has been shown to be a positive prognostic factor because it is often associated with tumor angiogenesis, which can promote tumor growth and metastasis, indicating higher biological activity of the tumor [ 29 \u2013 31 ]. VEGF, an angiogenic modulator, correlates with angiogenesis. Research indicates increased VEGF expression in OSCC tissue [ 32 \u2013 34 ], this parallels our findings. Moreover, the overexpression of VEGF within OSCC tissues positively correlates with MVD, indicating its crucial role in angiogenesis and OSCC progression [ 35 ]. In addition, serum VEGF levels were linearly correlated with the expression of malignant lesions, which may be a reliable biomarker and a potential target for the study of chemotherapy prevention and treatment strategies for oral cancer [ 36 , 37 ]. During tumor development, adequate supply of blood vessels is necessary. A variety of angiogenesis regulatory factors participate in the angiogenesis process, among which VEGF plays a dominant role as a potent vascular induction factor, which can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis, and regulate vascular permeability [ 38 ]. The human VEGF gene comprises 8 exons and 7 introns, alternative splicing of this gene yields three major VEGF isoforms: VEGF 121 , VEGF 165 , and VEGF 189 [ 12 , 13 ]. All VEGF 121 and partial VEGF 165 fail to bind HSPG due to their lack of exon 6/7 heparin binding domains, diffusing freely. Conversely, the remaining VEGF 165 and all VEGF 189 possess HSPG binding capacity and predominantly reside on cell surface or extracellular matrix HSPG [ 13 , 39 , 40 ]. In addition, studies have also found that HSPG and VEGF are also present on the surface of EVs, and EVs derived from ovarian, colon and kidney cancer cells carry VEGF 189 through HSPG [ 25 ]. Interestingly, OSCC\u2019s EVs also carried the VEGF 189 subtype (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, ovarian cancer cells secrete EVs that interact with VEGF 121 and VEGF 189 via CD63 [ 24 ], and VEGF 165 was carried by breast cancer cell derived MVs via HSP90 [ 26 ]. VEGF 189 has a significantly higher affinity for heparin than VEGF 165 , while VEGF 121 does not bind to heparin. This suggests that VEGF 189 preferentially accumulates in EVs due to its strong heparin binding. In comparison to soluble VEGF, VEGF 189 associated with EVs demonstrates increased stability and extended transport capabilities, thereby promoting angiogenesis in distant organs and enhancing tumor metastasis. Moreover, it shows that the isoform of EV-VEGF 189 showed higher expression in CAL-27, and there is also a trace amount of EV-VEGF 165 expressed in CAL-27. This might be due to the higher metastatic ability of CAL-27 compared to UM-SCC-6 [ 41 , 42 ]. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes all isoforms of human VEGF and is the dominant anti-angiogenic agent studied [ 43 ]. Initially, Bevacizumab was approved for metastatic colorectal cancer, subsequently broadening to ovarian cancer and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, as well as breast cancer [ 44 , 45 ]. However, the application of bevacizumab in the treatment of OSCC has not been successful, and bevacizumab has not effectively improved the survival rate of patients [ 46 , 47 ]. The mechanism leading to bevacizumab tolerance in OSCC patients may be related to EV-VEGF. VEGF 189 carried by EVs derived from ovarian, colon and kidney cancer cells are resistance to bevacizumab [ 25 ]. Furthermore, we discovered that the VEGF 189 contained on EVs originating from OSCC is consistent (Fig. 4 ). HSPG mediates the binding of EVs and VEGF in both cases. Research indicates that the binding of heparin to VEGF substantially reduces its \u03b2-sheet content and elevates its \u03b1-helix percentage. [ 48 ]. However, the residues within VEGF\u2019s \u03b25-sheet, \u03b25-\u03b26 loop, and \u03b26-sheet significantly contribute to form a high-affinity complex with bevacizumab [ 49 ]. Hence, this morphologic transformation could partially elucidate the mechanism of EV-VEGF\u2019s resistance to bevacizumab. To overcome bevacizumab resistance, there are several strategies, including combination with chemotherapy, combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, or targeting VEGF receptors and other pro-angiogenic factors [ 50 ]. In our study, we found that HSPG may also serve as a potential new target. Heparan sulfate (HS), a member of the glycosaminoglycan carbohydrate family, was initially isolated as an impurity from heparin and identified as highly prevalent in human tissues [ 51 ]. Heparin and HS each comprise repeating, unbranched, negatively charged disaccharides units that are sulfated at various positions including the 3-O, 6-O, and N on glucosamine, and the 6-O on glucuronic/iduronic acid; HS plays crucial emerging roles in tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and differentiation [ 52 \u2013 54 ]. HS interacts with pro-angiogenesis factors like FGFs, PDGF, and VEGF, augmenting tumor angiogenic signaling predominantly through HS modifications [ 55 \u2013 57 ]. Inhibition of HSPG distinctly impairs cancer angiogenesis and progression. The C-terminal segments of collagen XVIII, namely, endostatin, mildly interact with other HSPGs, preventing FGF-influenced endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor ascent [ 58 , 59 ]. Recombinant human endostatin\u2019s efficacy as an antiangiogenic therapy was validated in preclinical and NSCLC clinical trials [ 60 ]. Thus, HSPG antagonism could serve as a novel strategy for anti-angiogenesis therapy. Surfen, a heparan sulfate antagonist, is able to bind glycosaminoglycans, neutralize heparin, and influence heparin sulfation in vitro; it also counteracts both FGF2- and VEGF 165 -mediated sprouting of endothelial cells in Matrigel [ 61 ]. Our results also indicated that surfen can effectively inhibit the angiogenesis of OSCC-derived EV-VEGF in vitro and in vivo, and surfen and bevacizumab have a certain synergistic effect (Figs. 6 and 7 ). We analyzed that the reason for this synergistic effect might be attributed to three main factors: surfen\u2019s neutralization of HS leads to the release of VEGF from EVs, thereby increasing EV sensitivity to bevacizumab; surfen can directly inhibit VEGF\u2019s angiogenic function; and surfen might binds to the HS of endothelial cells, affecting VEGF\u2019s binding to its receptor [ 61 , 62 ]. Conclusion In summary, we demonstrated that OSCC cells secreted EV-VEGF 189 , which is important in OSCC resistance to bevacizumab. VEGF 189 bound to EVs mediated by HSPG principally. Therefore, surfen alone or in combination with bevacizumab is expected to be a new strategy for anti-angiogenesis therapy in OSCC patients.

    "full_text_abstract": "Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important proangiogenic factor and has been considered as a key target of antiangiogenetic therapy in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, clinical application of bevacizumab, a specific VEGF antibody, didn\u2019t improve the survival rate of OSCC patients. One possible explanation is that VEGF gene expresses diverse isoforms, which associate with extracellular vesicles (EVs), and EVs potentially contribute to VEGF resistance to bevacizumab. However, clear solution is lacking in addressing this issue. Methods Expression of VEGF isoforms in OSCC cells was confirmed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. EVs isolated from OSCC cell\u2019s conditioned medium (CM) were characterized by western blot, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Flow cytometry, immunogold labeling and western blot were applied to study the VEGF on EVs. Tube formation assay and Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay were used for analyzing the angiogenesis capacity of EV-VEGF. Results The most popular isoforms expressed by VEGF gene are VEGF 121 , VEGF 165 and VEGF 189 . In this study, we demonstrated that all three isoforms of mRNA could be detected at varying levels in OSCC cells, while only VEGF 165 and VEGF 189 proteins were found. CM derived from OSCC cells, both soluble and non-soluble forms of VEGF could be detected. We further confirmed the presence of VGEF 189 bound to EVs as a non-soluble form. EV-bound VEGF 189 presented angiogenic activity, which could not be neutralized by bevacizumab. It was found that VEGF 189 bound to EVs by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). In addition, the angiogenic effect of EV-VEGF could be reversed by surfen, a kind of HSPG antagonist both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Antagonists targeting HSPG might potentially overcome the resistance of EV-VEGF to bevacizumab and serve as an alternative for anti-VEGF therapy in OSCC.
