    "abstract_text": "Oxime ethers of alpha-acyl-beta-phenylpropanoic acids were prepared to apply as PPARalpha and gamma dual agonists. Among them, compound 11l proved to exhibit potent in vitro activities with EC(50) of 19 and 13nM in PPARalpha and gamma, respectively. It showed better glucose lowering effects than rosiglitazone 1 and ameliorated the lipid profile like plasma triglyceride in db/db mice model.",
