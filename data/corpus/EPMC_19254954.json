  "abstract_text": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification, mutations, and/or aberrant activation are frequent abnormalities in malignant gliomas and other human cancers and have been associated with an aggressive clinical course and a poor therapeutic outcome. Elevated glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), a major drug-metabolizing and stress response signaling protein, is also associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome in gliomas and other cancers. Here, we provide evidence that GSTP1 is a downstream EGFR target and that EGFR binds to and phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the GSTP1 protein in vitro and in vivo. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis analyses in a cell-free system and in gliomas cells identified Tyr-7 and Tyr-198 as major EGFR-specific phospho-acceptor residues in the GSTP1 protein. The phosphorylation increased GSTP1 enzymatic activity significantly, and computer-based modeling showed a corresponding increase in electronegativity of the GSTP1 active site. In human glioma and breast cancer cells, epidermal growth factor stimulation rapidly increased GSTP1 tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased cisplatin sensitivity. Lapatinib, a clinically active EGFR inhibitor, significantly reversed the epidermal growth factor-induced cisplatin resistance. These data define phosphorylation and activation of GSTP1 by EGFR as a novel, heretofore unrecognized component of the EGFR signaling network and a novel mechanism of tumor drug resistance, particularly in tumors with elevated GSTP1 and/or activated EGFR.",
