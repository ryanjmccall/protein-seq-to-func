  "abstract_text": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) is a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia. The gene responsible for MEN2A was localized by linkage analysis to chromosome 10q11.2 in 1987, and recently mutations in RET, a proto-oncogene in the candidate region, were discovered in patients with MEN. The majority of mutations found so far in MEN2A patients have been located in nucleotide sequences encoding cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of RET. To characterize MEN2A germline alterations in the Japanese population, we screened DNA from eight unrelated patients for mutations in exons 10 and 11 of the RET proto-oncogene and found mutations in all eight patients, at codons 618, 620, or 634; each of these sites encodes a cysteine residue in the extracellular domain of RET. The mutations were confirmed in other affected individuals in the respective families by digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products containing the mutated codons with restriction enzymes (Rs alpha I, CfoI, or AluI) for which cleavage sites had been generated by the specific genetic alteration. These PCR-restriction enzyme systems will be useful for genetic diagnosis in members of families carrying these mutations.",
