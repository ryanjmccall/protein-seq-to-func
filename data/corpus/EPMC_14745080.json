    "abstract_text": "The authors identified two novel heterozygous missense transitions in the gene for the mitochondrial polymerase gammaA subunit (POLG) in a family with an autosomal recessive syndrome comprising progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), polyneuropathy, ataxia, sensorineural hearing loss, and affective disorders. These mutations were not detected in 120 healthy control subjects.",
