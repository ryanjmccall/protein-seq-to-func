    "abstract_text": "Completion of DNA replication after replication stress depends on PCNA, which undergoes monoubiquitination to stimulate direct bypass of DNA lesions by specialized DNA polymerases or is polyubiquitinated to promote recombination-dependent DNA synthesis across DNA lesions by template switching mechanisms. Here we report that the ZRANB3 translocase, a SNF2 family member related to the SIOD disorder SMARCAL1 protein, is recruited by polyubiquitinated PCNA to promote fork restart following replication arrest. ZRANB3 depletion in mammalian cells results in an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange and DNA damage sensitivity after treatment with agents that cause replication stress. Using in\u00a0vitro biochemical assays, we show that recombinant ZRANB3 remodels DNA\u00a0structures mimicking stalled replication forks and disassembles recombination intermediates. We therefore propose that ZRANB3 maintains genomic stability at stalled or collapsed replication forks by facilitating fork restart and limiting inappropriate recombination that could occur during template switching events.",
