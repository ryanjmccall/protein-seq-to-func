    "abstract_text": "The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway participates in many physiological functions. In the current study we reported the cloning and characterization of five novel JNK2 transcript variants, which were designated as JNK2\u03b13, JNK2\u03b14, JNK2\u03b23, JNK2\u03b31 and JNK2\u03b32, respectively. Among them, JNK2\u03b14 and JNK2\u03b32 are potential non-coding RNA because they contain pre-mature stop codons. Both JNK2\u03b13 and JNK2\u03b23 contain an intact kinase domain, and both encode a protein product of 46 kDa, the same as those of JNK2\u03b11 and JNK2\u03b21. JNK2\u03b31 contains a disrupted kinase domain and it showed a disable function. When over-expressed in mammalian cells, JNK2\u03b13 showed higher activity on AP-1 than that of JNK2\u03b23 and JNK2\u03b31. Furthermore, JNK2\u03b13 and JNK2\u03b23 showed different levels of substrate phosphorylation, although they both could promote the proliferation of 293T cells. Our results further demonstrate that JNK2 isoforms preferentially target different substrates and may regulate the expression of various target genes.",
