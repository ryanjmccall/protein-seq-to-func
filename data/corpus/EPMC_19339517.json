Oncogenesis in breast cancer often requires the overexpression of the nuclear receptor coactivator AIB1/SRC-3 acting in conjunction with estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1). Phosphorylation of both ER\u03b1 and AIB1 has been shown to have profound effects on their functions. In addition, proteasome-mediated degradation plays a major role by regulating their stability and activity. CK1\u03b4, a member of the ubiquitous casein kinase-1 family, is implicated in the progression of breast cancer. In this study, we show that both ER\u03b1 and AIB1 are substrates for CK1\u03b4 in vitro , and identify a novel AIB1 phosphorylation site (S601) targeted by CK1\u03b4, significant for the co-activator function of AIB1. CK1\u03b4 is able to interact with ER\u03b1 and AIB1 in vivo , while overexpression of CK1\u03b4 in breast cancer cells results in an increased association of ER\u03b1 with AIB1 as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays from cell lysates. Using an siRNA-based approach, luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR, we observe that silencing of CK1\u03b4 leads to reduced ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity, despite increased ER\u03b1 levels, similarly to proteasome inhibition. We provide evidence that AIB1 protein levels are reduced by CK1\u03b4 silencing, in an estradiol-dependent manner; such destabilization can be inhibited by pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. We propose that differing activities adopted by ER\u03b1 and AIB1 as a consequence of their interactions with and phosphorylation by CK1\u03b4, particularly AIB1 stabilization, influence the transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1, and therefore have a role in breast cancer development. INTRODUCTION Estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of transcription factors, has been one of the most successful therapeutic targets for breast cancer ( 1 ). It contains 595 amino acids with a central DNA-binding domain (DBD) and transcriptional activation occurs through at least two distinct transactivation domains located in the amino-terminal A/B region (AF-1) and the carboxy terminal E region of the receptor (AF-2). The AF-1 domain is hormone-independent, whereas the AF-2 domain is estrogen-dependent; both AF domains are required for maximal ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity ( 2 ). In addition to being activated upon binding estrogen, we and others have shown that ER\u03b1 can be activated by phosphorylation ( 3 ). Activation of ER\u03b1 is also coupled with its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( 4\u20136 ). Upon ligand binding, ER\u03b1 becomes ubiquitinated and is targeted by the 26S proteasome for degradation ( 7 ). However, various direct or indirect mechanisms have been described that can protect ER\u03b1 from proteasomal degradation and thereby modulate its transcriptional activity including the involvement of the Amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB1) protein ( 8\u201310 ). AIB1 (SRC-3/ACTR/pCIP/RAC3), a p160 co-activating oncogene overexpressed in different types of cancer, especially breast tumors ( 11 ), associates with and regulates ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity; AIB1 recruits co-factors that possess histone acetyl-transferase activity and thus increases ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity through chromatin remodeling ( 12\u201314 ). Interestingly, it has been reported that AIB1 also regulates ER\u03b1 turnover through recruitment of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Suppression of AIB1 leads to ER\u03b1 stabilization in the presence of estradiol (E2) and subsequent reduction of ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity ( 15 ). The activity of AIB1 is modulated post-transcriptionally by phosphorylation which results in increased AIB1 degradation ( 16 , 17 ). Recently, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) has been shown to stabilize AIB1 protein levels in cancer cells ( 10 ), supporting the existence of an equilibrium of different kinases implicated in the promotion and prevention of AIB1 degradation, so called dual kinase regulation. Casein kinase 1 (CK1), a highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase family, is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic organisms ( 18 , 19 ) and alterations in the expression and/or activity of CK1 have been observed in breast carcinomas ( 19 , 20 ). Among CK1 isoforms, CK1\u03b4 is able to phosphorylate a diversity of substrates, modulating their activity and subcellular localization ( 19 , 21 ). As changes in the activity of CK1\u03b4, or mutations of CK1\u03b4-specific phosphorylation sites within it's substrates, contribute to dysregulation of various signaling pathways ( 19 , 22\u201325 ), we wished to establish the role of CK1\u03b4 in the regulation of ER\u03b1 activity. Here, we observe that CK1\u03b4 can interact with and phosphorylate both AIB1 and ER\u03b1 in vitro . Furthermore, overexpression of CK1\u03b4 protein levels in MCF7 cells enhanced the interactions between ER\u03b1 and AIB1. CK1\u03b4 silencing results in decreased ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity even though paradoxically ER\u03b1 levels appear increased. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on AIB1 can be rescued by proteasomal inhibition, suggesting that phosphorylation of AIB1 by CK1\u03b4 protects it from degradation. Finally we identify S601 in AIB1, a hitherto unidentified site, as the main phosphorylation aa targeted by CK1\u03b4, which is required for the activity of AIB1. These data herein, and recent evidence regarding dual kinase regulation ( 10 ), suggest a general mechanism by which the characteristics of the AIB1\u2013ER\u03b1 partnership can be modulated by CK1\u03b4-mediated phosphorylation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and reagents E2 was obtained from Sigma (Gillingham, UK) and dissolved in ethanol; Charcoal-dextran stripped serum (DSS) was obtained from Gemini (Bolnet, UK). The cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the kinase inhibitor IC261 were obtained from Merck (Nottingham, UK). Rabbit polyclonal CK1\u03b4 antibody was from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany); mouse monoclonal ER\u03b1, rabbit monoclonal anti-phosphoER\u03b1\u2013S118 and anti-\u03b2-actin mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) and Millipore (Southampton, UK) respectively. HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from GE Healthcare (Slough, UK). Plasmids The expression plasmid for yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)\u2013CK1\u03b4 was constructed as follows. PCR amplification was carried out using mouse testis cDNA as a template and the CK1\u03b4 primers: 5\u2032- GGATCC ATGGAGCTGAGGGTCGGGACA-3\u2032, 3\u2032- GGATCC TCAGTAGGTGGTACGTCGTGG-5\u2032, which contain a BamH1 restriction site (underlined). The PCR product was then cloned into the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and then subcloned into the BamH1 site of pEYFP vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). The expression plasmid for human Flag-tagged AIB1 (pCMV-Flag-AIB1) was generated as described previously ( 26 ). The expression plasmids: (i) pSG5-ER\u03b1 ( 27 ) and (ii) pGEX4T\u2013AIB1 (encompassing amino acids 582\u2013800) ( 26 ) were kind gifts from Professors Simak Ali and Bert W. O\u2019Malley respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis The expression plasmid pCMV-Flag-AIB1 baring a mutation at aa S601A was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer ' s instructions (Stratagene). The plasmid pCMV-Flag-AIB1 served as a template and the complementary primers used were: 5\u2032-GACAAAGAAAGTAAGGAGGCCAGTGTTGAGGGGGCAGAG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CTCTGCCCCCTCAACACTGGCCTCCTTACTTTCTTTGTC-3\u2032 (antisense). The plasmids pGEX4T\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 containing mutations at aas: S601A, S664A, T714A, S715A and S794 of AIB1, were constructed using the plasmid pGEX4T\u2013AIB1 582\u2013800 as a template and the following complimentary primers: (i) S601A: 5\u2032-GACAAAGAAAGTAAGGAGGCCAGTGTTGAGGGGGCAGAG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CTCTGCCCCCTCAACACTGGCCTCCTTACTTTCTTTGTC-3\u2032 (antisense), (ii) S664A: 5\u2032-GTCTCCTCCTCTACAGCTGG AGGAGTATCCTC-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-GAGGATACTCCTCCAGCTGTAGAGGAGGAGAC-3\u2032 (antisense), (iii) T714A: 5\u2032-GACA CCAGCAGTATAGCTTCTTGTGGGACGG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CCGTCCCCACAAGAAGCTATACTGCTGGTGTC-3\u2032 (antisense), (iv) S715A: 5\u2032-CCAGCAGTATAACTGCTTGTGGGGACGGAAATG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CATTTCCGTCCCCACAAGCAGTTATACTGCTGG-3\u2032 (antisense), (v) S794A: 5\u2032-GACAAGTGAAGAGGGAGCTGGAGACTTGGATAATC-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032- GATTATCCAAGTCTCCAGCTCCCTCTTCACTTGTC-3\u2032 (antisense). Cell culture and transfections MCF7, T47D, MELN ( 28 ) and COS-1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% DSS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% glutamine. HeLa cell line expressing wild-type ER\u03b1 has been described elsewhere ( 29 ) (a kind gift from Dr Shapiro). All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. MCF7 and MELN cells were transfected with 5 nM siRNA using Hiperfect according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Transient transfections of COS-1 and MCF7 were performed 24 h after seeding cells using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche, Sussex, UK). Cells were maintained in phenol red-free media with 5% charcoal-stripped serum 48 h before experimentation. The CK1\u03b4 isoform was silenced using two independent siRNAs, targeting the following sequences: 5\u2032-ccggtct aggatcgaaatgtt-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ctccctgacgattccactgta-3\u2032. At 48 h (or 72 h) post-transfection, cells were treated with either vehicle (ethanol) or E2, and harvested later (as indicated) for RNA or protein analyses. RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR Isolation of total RNA was performed using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed using oligo (deoxythymidine) primers (Qiagen) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCRs using the TaqMan mastermix (Applied Biosystems) were performed on a 7900HT Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) using primers for pS2, PR and GAPDH cDNAs, purchased from Applied Biosystems. Firefly luciferase assay MELN cells (0.5 \u00d7 10 6 ) were plated in 24-well plates in medium containing DMEM/10% DSS for 24 h, transfected with CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 48 h and treated with E2 (10 nM) or vehicle (ethanol) for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 50 \u03bcl/well luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Southampton, UK). Luciferase assays were performed using the firefly luciferase assay system from Promega, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and measured with a Top Count NXT luminometer (Packard Biosciences, Beaconsfield, UK). All experiments were performed independently at least three times, and results presented as the mean with standard error of the mean error bars. Data are normalized to the untreated sample, which was given a reference value of one. Western blotting and SDS\u2013PAGE Whole cell lysates were prepared in NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% NP40, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 50 \u00b5M leupeptin and 30 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin). For western blotting, extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and the protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Cramlington, UK). Lysates were then boiled in 5\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (5 min, 95\u00b0C), subjected to 12.5% SDS\u2013PAGE and blotted on a Hybond C super nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Following this, the membranes were blocked in TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween20 and 5% (w/v) non-fat milk for 1 h, before probed overnight (O/N) with different antibodies in the same buffer, and washed extensively in TBS/Tween. Immunocomplexes were detected by incubation for 45 min with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) (GE Healthcare). The intensity of bands were quantified using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Immunoprecipitation Cells lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15 000 rpm, 10 min, 4\u00b0C). Lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were precleared with IgG bound to protein A or G-agarose beads (Sigma) for 12 h at 4\u00b0C and immunoprecipitated with the specific primary antibody and protein A or protein G-agarose overnight with gentle agitation. The precipitates were then subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and immunoblotting using phosphospecific primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. In vitro kinase assays In vitro kinase assays were carried out as described previously ( 23 ). ER\u03b1-substrates that were used were: (i) full-length recombinant human ER\u03b1, (ii) GST-recombinant human ER\u03b1 fragment encompassing the AF1 transactivation domain and the DNA-binding domain (aa 1\u2013280) and (iii) GST-recombinant human ER\u03b1 fragment encompassing the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (aa 283\u2013595). AIB1-substrates were: (i) full-length purified AIB1 and (ii) different GST-recombinant human AIB1 fragments encompassing the RID region, responsible for ligand-dependent interaction with NRs (aa 582\u2013800) (wt and those containing mutations at the following AIB1 aas: S601A, S664A, T714A, S715A and S794A). As a source of enzyme activity we used GST-tagged recombinant human CK1\u03b4 protein (Invitrogen). Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and the protein bands were visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated, the phosphorylated protein bands were excised and quantified by Cherenkov counting using LS-6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, San Francisco, CA, USA). Immunofluorescence MCF-7 cells were grown on poly- d -lysine-coated glass coverslips for 24 h in DMEM/10% DSS. Next, cells were transfected with CK1\u03b4 siRNA or vehicle (ethanol) for 48 h and treated with E2 (10 nM) for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and fixed in methanol for 15 min at 20\u00b0C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 1 h, before incubating them with AIB1 anti-rabbit antibody (1:300 in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, coverslips were incubated for 45 min at RT with Alexa 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen). DNA was visualized by DAPI staining. Cells were examined on an Axiovert-200 laser scanning inverted microscope (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK) equipped with a confocal imaging system. Statistical analysis Exploratory data analysis demonstrated that the distributions were often skewed with outliers. Shapiro\u2013Wilks test was used to test for normality (data were not normally distributed) and between group comparisons were made using the non parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. RESULTS CK1\u03b4 silencing modulates ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity and decreases E2-induced expression of ER\u03b1 regulated genes To investigate the involvement of CK1\u03b4 in E2-dependent transcriptional activation of ER\u03b1, MELN cells (MCF7 cells, stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an estrogen response element using the \u03b2-globin promoter) were transfected with negative control siRNA (CT siRNA) or CK1\u03b4 siRNA (5 nM), treated with 10 nM E2 for 24 h, and luciferase activities measured. Treatment with E2 alone resulted in a 20-fold induction of luciferase activity. There were no effects of CT siRNA on the activity of ER\u03b1 in this assay. However, in the presence of CK1\u03b4 siRNA the E2-dependent luciferase activity was decreased 35%, implying an association of CK1\u03b4 in E2-induced ER\u03b1 activation ( Figure 1 A). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed \u223c80% reduced CK1\u03b4 mRNA levels after siRNA treatment ( Figure 1 B). Figure 1. CK1\u03b4 silencing decreases the transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1 and downregulates E2-induced expression of ER\u03b1 target genes. ( A ) MELN cells (5 \u00d7 10 4 ) were plated in 24-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% stripped DSS. Cells were transfected with 5 nM scrambled siRNA (CT siRNA) or with 5 nM CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 48 h and incubated with or without E2 (10 nM) for 24 h. ERE-dependent gene expression was quantified by measuring luciferase activity, given as fold of control. Error bars represent SD of two experiments. ( B ) Quantitative real-time RT\u2013PCR validation of down-regulation of CK1\u03b4 mRNA levels after treatment with 5 nM siRNA. MCF7 cells (2 \u00d7 10 5 ) were plated in 6-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% DSS. Cells were transfected either with 5 nM CT siRNA or with 5 nM siRNA targeting CK1\u03b4 and treated or not (vehicle) with E2 (10 nM) for 24 h. Cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted and used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription, as described in \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section. Gene expression of ( C ) pS2 and ( D ) PR was measured by quantitative real-time RT\u2013PCR. MCF-7 cells (2 \u00d7 10 5 ) were plated in 6-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% DSS. Following, cells were incubated for 24 h with 1\u03bcM of the CK1\u03b4/\u03f5-specific inhibitor IC261 and treated or not (vehicle) with E2 (10 nM) for 24 h. Cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted and used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription, as described in \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section. Gene expression of ( E ) pS2 and, ( F ) PR was measured by quantitative real-time RT\u2013PCR. Transfection of MCF7 cells with a (EYFP)-CK1\u03b4 plasmid resulted in an increase of ( G ) pS2 expression. GAPDH was used for normalisation. Error bars represent SD of two separate experiments, each in triplicate; changes observed throughout these experiments were statistically significant ( P < 0.05). We next examined the effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on ER-regulated gene expression by performing qRT-PCR for two well-known estrogen-induced genes (pS2 and PR). Treatment of MCF7 cells with CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 48 h reduced expression of both pS2 and PR, by 55% and 43%, respectively ( Figure 1 C and D). These results, in conjunction with the luciferase assay performed in MELN cells, confirmed either a direct or indirect involvement of CK1\u03b4 in the regulation of ER\u03b1 target gene expression. Use of 1\u03bcM IC261 ( 30 ), a small molecule inhibitor preferentially inhibiting the CK1\u03b4 and \u03b5 isoforms, resulted in a higher reduction of pS2 and PR expression (69% and 66%, respectively) ( Figure 1 E and F). This difference can be explained by the fact that the use of siRNA knocked down \u223c80% of CK1\u03b4; therefore the lesser effect on gene expression after siRNA treatment, compared to IC261 treatment, is due to the residual CK1\u03b4. To establish whether downregulation of ER\u03b1-targeted genes expression is partly due to CK1\u03b4 catalytic suppression, we transfected MCF7 cells for 24 h with an expression plasmid encoding EYFP-CK1\u03b4. Overexpression of CK1\u03b4 (confirmed by western blotting) resulted in a \u223c2-fold increase in E2-induced expression of pS2 ( Figure 1 G), demonstrating that the presence of CK1\u03b4 regulates ER\u03b1 target gene expression. ER\u03b1\u2013S118 is not targeted for phosphorylation by CK1\u03b4 Since we have previously shown that phosphorylation at S118 of ER\u03b1 is implicated in regulation of transcriptional activation ( 31 , 32 ), we analyzed the effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on phosphorylation of ER\u03b1. MCF7 cells, untransfected or transfected with either CT siRNA or CK1\u03b4 siRNA, were stimulated for 30 min with 100 nM E2 and then probed for ER\u03b1 phospho-S118. Short-term E2 treatment induced ER\u03b1 phosphorylation at S118 in both untransfected and control siRNA-transfected cells ( Figure 2 A). This phosphorylation was not suppressed by CK1\u03b4 siRNA, but was instead increased ( Figure 2 A and B). Furthermore, the total ER\u03b1 protein content was also increased in the CK1\u03b4 siRNA-treated cells. Quantification and comparison of the phospho-S118:ER\u03b1 ratio in treated and untreated MCF7 cells implicated upregulation of ER\u03b1 protein levels as cause of the increase in observed ER\u03b1 phospho-S118 phosphorylation levels ( Figure 2 B). Figure 2. CK1\u03b4 does not phosphorylate ER\u03b1 at S118. ( A ) MCF7 cells (2 \u00d7 10 5 ) were plated in 6-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% DSS. Cells were untransfected or transfected with 5 nM CT siRNA or with 5 nM CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 72 h and treated or not with E2 (100 nM) for 45 min. Cells were harvested, lysed and equal protein amounts were subjected to Western blotting analysis using the indicated antibodies. \u03b2-actin was used as a control for sample loading. Immunoblot showing silencing of CK1\u03b4. ( B ) Quantitative analysis of ER\u03b1 pS118, ER\u03b1 protein levels and the pS118:ER\u03b1 ratio is given as fold of control. ( C ) Western blotting of the levels of ER\u03b1 expressed in the stably transfected Hela-ER\u03b1 cell line. ( D ) Hela-ER\u03b1 cells untransfected or transfected with 5 nM CT siRNA or with 5 nM CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 72 h were treated or not with E2 (100 nM) for 45 min. Cell extracts were immunoblotted. ( E ) Quantitative analysis of ER\u03b1 phospho-S118, is given as fold of control. All data are representative of results from two independent experiments. Error bars represent SD of two separate experiments in triplicate. In order to further validate that ER\u03b1\u2013S118 is not phosphorylated by CK1\u03b4 in vivo , we used a stably transfected HeLa cell line expressing wild-type ER\u03b1 ( Figure 2 C). Compared with E2 treatment, CK1\u03b4 siRNA failed to reduce the phosphorylation of S118 in Hela-ER\u03b1 cells ( Figure 2 D and E). These results indicate that the involvement of CK1\u03b4 in the regulation of ER\u03b1 transcriptional activation is not mediated via phosphorylation at S118, but could result from phosphorylation either at: (i) other ER\u03b1 site(s) or (ii) proteins that interact and modulate ER\u03b1 activity. CK1\u03b4 silencing stabilizes ER\u03b1 protein levels in breast cancer cell lines Next, we investigated protein levels of ER\u03b1 following inhibition of the proteasome in the presence of E2 (100 nM). Addition of MG132 (5 \u03bcM), a cell permeable proteasome inhibitor, prevented ER\u03b1 degradation in E2-treated MCF7 ( Figure 3 A and B) and T47D breast cancer cells ( Figure 3 C and D) Moreover, in the presence of E2, both CK1\u03b4 silencing and MG132 treatment elevated ER\u03b1 levels, while co-treatment resulted in further increases. Similar results were obtained in MCF7 cells, using another independent CK1\u03b4 siRNA, ensuring that the data do not reflect off-target effects ( Supplementary Figure 1A and B ). Finally, in order to investigate whether the observed CK1\u03b4 silencing-related increase of ER\u03b1 protein levels might be induced by an increase of ER\u03b1 gene transcription, we performed qRT-PCR and examined the ER\u03b1 mRNA expression levels upon CK1\u03b4-siRNA treatment. Our results did not reveal any significant alteration of ER\u03b1 mRNA following CK1\u03b4 RNA interference (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that CK1\u03b4 is implicated in the stabilization of ER\u03b1 in E2-stimulated cells, potentially through direct or indirect phosphorylation events. Figure 3.

All data are representative of results from two independent experiments. Error bars represent SD of two separate experiments in triplicate. CK1\u03b4 silencing decreases AIB1 protein levels in the presence of E2 We have demonstrated that inhibition of CK1\u03b4 leads to a decrease in ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity and a reduction of E2-responsive gene expression, whilst stabilizing ER\u03b1 protein levels. Related \u2018contradictory\u2019 or apparently \u2018paradoxical\u2019 observations have been reported for AIB1 co-activator suppression ( 15 ), where AIB1 is necessary for E2-induced ER\u03b1 degradation, optimal binding of ER\u03b1 to target gene promoters and full ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity. Consequently, we investigated the effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on AIB1 protein levels. MCF7 cells were transfected either with CT siRNA or CK1\u03b4 siRNA in the presence or absence of E2 (100 nM), followed by immunoblotting using a mouse monoclonal AIB1 antibody. Whereas in untreated, E2-treated and control siRNA-treated cells the AIB1 protein levels remained unaffected, treatment with CK1\u03b4 siRNA followed by E2 stimulation resulted in a 60% decrease of AIB1 protein levels ( Figure 4 A and B). Moreover, overexpression of CK1\u03b4 in MCF7 cells resulted in stabilization of AIB1 (data not shown). Figure 4. CK1\u03b4 silencing decreases AIB1 protein levels in the presence of E2. ( A ) MCF7 cells (2 \u00d7 10 5 ) were plated in 6-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% DSS. Cells were untransfected or transfected with 5 nM CT siRNA or with 5 nM CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 72 h and treated or not with E2 (100 nM) for 45 min. Cells were harvested, lysed and equal protein amounts were subjected to western blotting using a specific AIB1 mouse monoclonal antibody. Samples were probed for equal loading using a \u03b2-actin specific monoclonal antibody. ( B ) Quantitative analysis of AIB1 protein levels is given as fold of control. ( C ) MCF7 cells were untransfected or transfected with 5 nM CT siRNA or with 5 nM CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 72 h. Where indicated, cells were incubated with MG132 (5\u03bcM) for 6 h and and then treated with E2 (100 nM) for 45 min. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with AIB1 antibody. ( D ) Quantitative analysis of AIB1 protein levels with or without MG132 pre-treatment in the presence of E2. All data are representative results from two independent experiments. ( E ) Fluorescence microscopy was performed on either untransfected MCF7 cells or cells transfected with 5 nM CK1\u03b4 siRNA for 72 h followed by the addition of E2 (100 nM) for 45 min. All cells were grown on coverslips, then fixed and stained as described in \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section. Since AIB1 can be degraded through the 26S proteasome (as well as the REG\u03b3-mediated proteasome pathway) we examined whether AIB1 downregulation could be rescued by MG132. Use of MG132 rescued the CK1\u03b4 siRNA-mediated decrease of AIB1 in E2-treated MCF7 cells ( Figure 4 C and D) (similar results were obtained using another independent CK1\u03b4 siRNA). These results imply an involvement of CK1\u03b4 in the proteasome-dependent regulation of AIB1 expression. The effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on AIB1 protein levels were also investigated by IF, where MCF7 cells, untransfected or transfected with CK1\u03b4 siRNA, were stimulated with E2, and the subcellular localization of AIB1 was visualised using the AIB1 antibody. Treatment with CK1\u03b4 siRNA resulted in a significantly decrease in nuclear AIB1 compared to untreated cells, in the presence of E2 ( Figure 4 E). CK1\u03b4 associates with human ER\u03b1 and AIB1 and regulates their interactions In order to clarify whether ER\u03b1 and AIB1 are physiological substrates for CK1\u03b4, we examined whether these proteins can physically associate in vivo . COS-1 cells were transiently transfected for 24 h with expression plasmids encoding for either: (i) ER\u03b1 and CK1\u03b4 or, (ii) AIB1 and CK1\u03b4, following treatment with or without 100 nM E2 for 30 min. Subsequently, the potential interactions between: (i) ER\u03b1\u2013CK1\u03b4 and, (ii) AIB1-CK1\u03b4 were assessed by immunoprecipitation of CK1\u03b4 followed by analyses of the immune complexes for the presence of ER\u03b1 and AIB1 respectively. An association of CK1\u03b4 with ER\u03b1 as well as with AIB1 in the presence or absence of E2 was observed, although the interaction was reduced in the absence of E2 ( Figure 5 A). In addition, CK1\u03b4 was able to co-precipitate with ER\u03b1 phosphorylated at S118, suggesting that it is able to interact with this form of ER\u03b1 ( Figure 5 A). Figure 5. CK1\u03b4 associates with ER\u03b1 and AIB1 in vivo and regulates their interactions. ( A ) Lysates from untreated or E2-stimulated COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with CK1\u03b4 or non-immune IgG followed by immunoblotting with anti-ER\u03b1, anti-pS118/ER\u03b1 and anti-AIB1. ( B ) MCF7 cells (i) untransfected or (ii) transfected with a (EYFP)-CK1\u03b4 plasmid were stimulated with 100 nM E2 for 30 min before precipitation with anti-AIB1 antibody. The interaction between AIB1 and ER\u03b1 was visualised by western blotting using an anti-ER\u03b1 antibody. Equal amounts of protein were added in both lanes. The ability of CK1\u03b4 to interact with the ER\u03b1\u2013AIB1 complex, led us to examine whether CK1\u03b4 is able to influence the interactions between ER\u03b1 and AIB1. To address this issue, we overexpressed CK1\u03b4 in MCF7 cells for 24 h, and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments following treatment with 100 nM E2 for 30 min. Our results showed that increased CK1\u03b4 protein levels resulted in an increased ER\u03b1\u2013AIB1 association, compared to untransfected cells, in the presence of E2 ( Figure 5 B). Overall, these data demonstrate that CK1\u03b4 is involved in the regulation of ER\u03b1\u2013AIB1 interactions, critical for the modulation of ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity. CK1\u03b4 phosphorylates ER\u03b1 in the AF1-DBD domain and AIB1 at S601 in vitro Since the phosphorylation status of ER\u03b1 and AIB1 play essential roles in their functions, we examined the ability of CK1\u03b4 to phosphorylate these proteins. We performed in vitro kinase assays using the purified catalytic subunit of CK1 as source of enzyme activity. As ER\u03b1-substrates we used: (i) full-length recombinant human ER\u03b1, (ii) GST-recombinant human ER\u03b1 fragment encompassing the AF1 transactivation domain and the DNA-binding domain (aa 1\u2013280) and (iii) GST-recombinant human ER\u03b1 fragment encompassing the LBD (aa 283\u2013595) ( Figure 6 A and B). As AIB1-substrates we used: (i) purified full-length AIB1 and (ii) GST-recombinant human AIB1 fragment encompassing the RID region, responsible for ligand-dependent interaction with NRs (aa 582\u2013800) ( Figure 6 C and D). Figure 6. CK1\u03b4 phosphorylates ER\u03b1 and AIB1 in vitro . ( A ) Schematic representation of human ER\u03b1. AF: activator function. ( B ) In vitro kinase assays were performed using purified recombinant human CK1\u03b4 as source of enzyme and: (i) full-length recombinant human ER\u03b1, (ii) GST-recombinant human ER\u03b1 (aa 1\u2013280) and (iii) GST-recombinant human ER\u03b1 (aa 283\u2013595), as substrates.

( D ) In vitro kinase assays were performed using recombinant human CK1\u03b4 as source of enzyme and as substrates: (i) purified full-length AIB1 and (ii) GST-recombinant human AIB1 (aa 582\u2013800). ( E ) CK1 phosphorylates one major residue of AIB1. GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of CK1 for the indicated times. Up to 1.6 mol phosphate/mol protein were incorporated into the GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 fusion protein. ( F ) Phosphorylation of GST\u2013AIB1 fusion proteins by CK1\u03b4. In vitro kinase assays were performed using recombinant human CK1\u03b4 as the source of enzyme and: (i) GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 (wt), (ii) GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 (S664A), (iii) GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 (T714A), (iv) GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 (S715A), (v) GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 (S794A) and (vi) GST\u2013AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 (S601A), as substrates. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Quantification of phosphate incorporation of phosphorylated proteins was measured by Cerenkov counting. Error bars represent SD of two experiments, each in triplicate. C: Coomasie. A: Autoradiogram. We demonstrated that CK1\u03b4 can phosphorylate ER\u03b1 in vitro , and its prospective phosphorylation target(s) are located within the AF1-DBD area of ER\u03b1 ( Figure 6 B). Moreover, CK1\u03b4 was able to phosphorylate full-length AIB1 within aa 582\u2013800 ( Figure 6 D). Use of additional GST-fusion proteins containing fragments derived from AIB1 (containing aa 1\u2013321, aa 321\u2013581 and aa 841\u20131081) were not phosphorylated by CK1\u03b4 (our data not shown and also shown by others) ( 26 ). Bioinformatic sequence examination ( http://scansite.mit.edu ) revealed several potential CK1\u03b4 phosphorylation sites in the AF1-DBD domain of ER\u03b1 and in the region between aa 582 and 800 of AIB1. In order to determine the stoichiometry of AIB1 phosphorylation by CK1\u03b4, we performed in vitro time course kinase assays using the GST-AIB1 fusion protein encompassing aa 582\u2013800 as substrate and the purified catalytic subunit of CK1 as enzyme. Our results demonstrated that \u223c1.6 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of protein, implying the existence of at least one major aa in AIB1 (within the region of aa 582\u2013800) phosphorylated by CK1 in vitro ( Figure 6 E). Subsequently, to identify the exact phosphorylation site(s) of AIB1, we generated different GST-AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 fusion proteins baring mutations from S or T to A at various prospective aas (S601, S664, T714, S715, S794) that could be phosphorylated by CK1\u03b4. Our in vitro kinase assays clearly revealed that the AIB1 residues (i) S664, (ii) T714 and (iii) S715 were not targeted for phosphorylation by CK1 ( Figure 6 F). Mutation of S794 to A resulted in a \u223c10% reduction of phosphorylation compared to the wild-type GST-AIB1 aa 582\u2013800, whilst the degree of phosphorylation of GST-AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 S601A was less then 40% compared with that of wild type GST-AIB1 aa 582\u2013800 ( Figure 6 F). These results strongly suggest that the major site of AIB1 phosphorylated by CK1\u03b4 is S601. Phosphorylation of S601 by CK1\u03b4 in vivo affects the co-activation function of AIB1 In order to examine the importance of S601 in relation to CK1\u03b4 phosphorylation in vivo , an AIB1 expression plasmid baring a mutation at S601A was generated (pCMV-Flag-AIB1/S601A). Following this, the effects of S601A mutant on the ability of AIB1 to function as a transcriptional co-activator was assessed by measuring the estrogen-dependent induction of endogenous pS2 mRNA levels in MCF7 cells, after increasing or decreasing CK1\u03b4 protein levels, respectively. In the presence of E2, transient co-transfections of wt AIB1 and CK1\u03b4 resulted in an increase (\u223c60%) of pS2 gene expression levels, compared to untransfected cells ( Figure 7 A), while a small increase (\u223c10%) of pS2 mRNA levels was observed after over-expression of the AIB1/S601A mutant along with CK1\u03b4 ( Figure 7 A). To further establish that the observed changes in the co-activation functions of AIB1 can be attributed to phosphorylation of S601 by CK1\u03b4, MCF7 cells were treated with 1\u03bcM IC261 and pS2 mRNA levels were quantified. In accordance with \u2018our hypothesis\u2019, in the presence of E2 inhibition of CK1\u03b4 led to decreased activity of wt AIB1 to basal pS2 mRNA levels ( Figure 7 B) compared to over-expression of both wt AIB1 and CK1\u03b4. As expected, use of the IC261 inhibitor did not alter the activity of AIB1/S601A mutant ( Figure 7 B). We conclude that these functional data indicate that phospho-S601 residue within the RID domain is necessary and sufficient for AIB1 co-activation functions. Figure 7. Functional role of CK1\u03b4-dependent phosphorylation of S601 in ER\u03b1-dependent transcription. MCF7 cells (2 \u00d7 10 5 ) were plated in 6-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% DSS. ( A ) Cells were co-transfected either with 1\u03bcg of: (i) pCMV-Flag-AIB1 and (EYFP)\u2013CK1\u03b4 plasmids or, (ii) pCMV-Flag-AIB1/S601A and (EYFP)\u2013CK1\u03b4 plasmids for 24 h.

Subsequently, all cells were treated or not (vehicle) with E2 (10 nM) for 24 h. Cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted and used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription, as described in \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section. Gene expression of pS2 was measured by qRT-PCR. Error bars represent SD of two separate experiments, each in triplicate ( P < 0.05). DISCUSSION Protein phosphorylation, an essential post-translational modification, regulates protein functions including activity, stability, subcellular localization and interactions with other proteins and substrates ( 33 , 34 ). Kinases are therefore considered key regulatory proteins and elucidation of their roles in signaling pathways is essential ( 35 ). In the present study, we have identified ER\u03b1 and AIB1 as novel substrates for CK1\u03b4 in vitro that are able to interact in a cellular context, proposing an involvement of CK1\u03b4 in regulating their interactions and functions. In addition, we have identified S601 within AIB1 as a novel phosphorylation site targeted by CK1\u03b4 in vitro , while AIB1-S601A mutant protein negatively influenced AIB1's co-activation function in ER\u03b1-dependent transcription. Furthermore, using CK1\u03b4 siRNA in MCF7 breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that CK1\u03b4 is required for full ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity and is involved in the regulation of ER\u03b1 protein levels in the presence of E2. Finally, we have shown that suppression of CK1\u03b4 results in proteasome-mediated degradation of AIB1, in the presence of E2, implying that CK1\u03b4 phosphorylation protects AIB1 from proteolysis. We examined the effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on the transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1 and observed a 35% decrease in the E2 response of an integrated ERE reporter gene. Moreover, the effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on the expression levels of two endogenous estrogen-responsive genes, pS2 and PR, resulted in reductions of 55% and 43% respectively when CK1\u03b4 siRNA was used, while the reductions were even higher (69% and 66%) in the presence of a CK1\u03b4 inhibitor (IC261). In contrast, overexpression of CK1\u03b4 resulted in a 2-fold increase in pS2 mRNA levels. In vitro kinase assays using the CK1\u03b4 as enzyme and different ER\u03b1 fragments as substrates showed that CK1\u03b4 predominantly phosphorylates the AF1 domain of ER\u03b1. Thus far, various kinases have been identified that can phosphorylate the AF1 domain and thereby regulate ER\u03b1 activity ( 3 , 36 ). In this report, we identify a novel involvement of CK1 as a direct and/or indirect regulator of ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity. Since phosphorylation of ER\u03b1 S118 is correlated with ER\u03b1 activity, we next examined phospho-S118 levels in MCF7 cells following CK1\u03b4 silencing. Our results demonstrate increased phospho-S118 levels that paradoxically followed a CK1\u03b4 siRNA-induced dependent increase in total ER\u03b1. These data suggest that S118 is not phosphorylated by CK1\u03b4 implicating other unidentified ER\u03b1 site(s) as targets for CK1\u03b4, which eventually could modulate the activity of ER\u03b1. However, CK1\u03b4 appears to be involved in the regulation of ER\u03b1 protein levels, as demonstrated in two different breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) after treatment with CK1\u03b4 siRNA resulting in ER\u03b1 stabilization. It is well known that ER\u03b1 protein turnover occurs through the proteasome in a cyclic manner, dependent on ligand binding, which ensures a stable and balanced cellular level of the receptor ( 6 , 37 ). Moreover, it has been reported that the differential transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1 produced upon binding of different synthetic ligands (SERMs), correlates with the degradation rate of ER\u03b1 ( 38 ), with higher activities corresponding to faster degradation. Various kinases and multiple agents that activate or inhibit phosphorylation have been implicated in modifying the proteasome-mediated stability of ER\u03b1 and consequently its activity ( 8 , 39\u201341 ). Taken together, our data suggest that CK1 represents a new protein kinase involved in the stabilization of ER\u03b1. Additionally, several observations have linked the recruitment of ER\u03b1 co-factors with ligand-dependent degradation of ER\u03b1. Particularly in the case of AIB1, it has been shown that siRNA-mediated silencing of AIB1 results in ER\u03b1 stabilization, but a loss in ER\u03b1 activity. This stabilization correlates with a reduction in recruitment of components of the ubiquitin proteasome machinery ( 15 ). Therefore, we have also examined the effects of CK1\u03b4 silencing on AIB1 protein levels. CK1\u03b4 siRNA treatment in the presence of E2 produced a 60% decrease in AIB1 protein levels, an effect that was confirmed by IF, where the overall fluorescent signal of AIB1 was markedly weaker when cells were treated with CK1\u03b4 siRNA. The decrease in AIB1 levels was rescued by proteasome inhibition, implicating CK1\u03b4 in the regulation of AIB1 proteasome-mediated degradation. Our in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that AIB1, in addition to ER\u03b1, can be a substrate for CK1\u03b4 phosphorylation. Use of an AIB1 GST-fusion protein revealed that the prospective phosphorylation site(s) of AIB1 targeted by CK1\u03b4 are located within amino acids 582\u2013800, which encompass the RID domain of AIB1, required for interactions with NRs. Time-course experiments revealed that there is one major phosphorylation site for CK1 within aa 582\u2013800 of AIB1. In vitro kinase assays using various GST\u2013AIB1 fusion proteins as substrates revealed that CK1 mainly phosphorylates S601 in AIB1, a hitherto unidentified phosphosite. The presence of a serine residue at position n \u2212 3 of S601 (K 596 E S KES 601 ) resembles the optimal consensus recognition motif for CK1 ( 42 ), thereby favouring S601 as the main phosphorylation site targeted by CK1. Examination of the role of S601 revealed a physiological importance of this site in the activity of AIB1 in breast cancer cells, after demonstrating that mutation of this aa negatively influenced the expression levels of the E2-dependent pS2 genes. However, additional experiments are required in order to elucidate the exact molecular mechanism of the involvement of S601 in the regulation of AIB1's co-activation function. Our data herein, reveal an association of CK1\u03b4 with ER\u03b1 and AIB1, which can result in a complex formation that enables CK1\u03b4 to interact, phosphorylate and exert its effects by regulating the interaction between ER\u03b1 and AIB1 and thereby modulate the functions of these two proteins. AIB1 is a target for multiple signaling pathways and its phosphorylation state is a determinant of its functionality including degradation and interactions with other proteins ( 17 ). Phosphorylation of AIB1 by different kinases has been associated with increased AIB1 degradation ( 16 , 17 ); however, a recent report ( 10 ) identified aPKC as the first kinase able to stabilize AIB1 in cancer cells and thereby enhance its activity. Based on our results, we propose a model where CK1\u03b4 protects AIB1 from proteolysis, as part of a balanced equilibrium in which kinases are required to maintain a consistent protein level of AIB1 ( Figure 8 ). However, aberrations in this balance towards CK1\u03b4, as occurs in breast cancer, would be expected to increase AIB1 levels, and therefore also the expression of ER\u03b1-respondent target genes. These genes are critical to breast cancer growth, as evidenced by the successes in the use of anti-estrogens to treat breast cancer, so we speculate here that increases in their expression may be a determinant of cancer progression and/or resistance to anti-estrogens. It is interesting to note here that both the receptor and its co-activator partner are subject to phosphorylation by the same kinase, introducing hierarchical, sequential or simultaneous phosphorylation possibilities in this dual regulatory pathway. However, using purified substrates in the in vitro kinase assays suggests that CK1\u03b4 can interact with and phosphorylate both independently. Figure 8. A model for the regulation of ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity, involving CK1\u03b4 and AIB1. In the presence of E2, CK1\u03b4 interacts with and phosphorylates AIB1 predominantly at S601 and probably ER\u03b1 at other site(s), inducing the formation of a complex between them that is required for the complete transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1. Inhibition of CK1\u03b4-mediated phosphorylation, potentially alters the conformation of AIB1 and promotes its proteasome-mediated degradation; subsequently, ER\u03b1 protein levels are stabilized and ER\u03b1 activity is decreased. Our results, identifying a novel AIB1 phosphorylation site (S601) that affects the co-activation function of AIB1, in conjunction with a new report which suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of AIB1 is also required for its activity ( 43 ) demonstrate the importance of post-translational modifications as an additional level of transcriptional regulation. Generation of a phospho-specific antibody against S601 in AIB1 is currently underway; correlations between phosphorylated levels of AIB1 at S601 in breast cancer samples and clinical outcome parameters such as time to progression, overall survival and clinical endocrine resistance, remain to be tested. It has already been shown that ER\u03b1 and AIB1 shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus ( 44 , 45 ). Phosphorylation events induced by different kinases occur in both compartments influencing their functions, including stability, mobility and activity ( 3 , 46\u201349 ) as per our proposed model ( Figure 8 ). In this report we identify CK1\u03b4, a predominantly cytoplasmic protein ( 50 , 51 ), as a novel kinase implicated in the modulation of physiological aspects of both ER\u03b1 and AIB1.

    "full_text_abstract": "Oncogenesis in breast cancer often requires the overexpression of the nuclear receptor coactivator AIB1/SRC-3 acting in conjunction with estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1). Phosphorylation of both ER\u03b1 and AIB1 has been shown to have profound effects on their functions. In addition, proteasome-mediated degradation plays a major role by regulating their stability and activity. CK1\u03b4, a member of the ubiquitous casein kinase-1 family, is implicated in the progression of breast cancer. In this study, we show that both ER\u03b1 and AIB1 are substrates for CK1\u03b4 in vitro , and identify a novel AIB1 phosphorylation site (S601) targeted by CK1\u03b4, significant for the co-activator function of AIB1. CK1\u03b4 is able to interact with ER\u03b1 and AIB1 in vivo , while overexpression of CK1\u03b4 in breast cancer cells results in an increased association of ER\u03b1 with AIB1 as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays from cell lysates. Using an siRNA-based approach, luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR, we observe that silencing of CK1\u03b4 leads to reduced ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity, despite increased ER\u03b1 levels, similarly to proteasome inhibition. We provide evidence that AIB1 protein levels are reduced by CK1\u03b4 silencing, in an estradiol-dependent manner; such destabilization can be inhibited by pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. We propose that differing activities adopted by ER\u03b1 and AIB1 as a consequence of their interactions with and phosphorylation by CK1\u03b4, particularly AIB1 stabilization, influence the transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1, and therefore have a role in breast cancer development."
