  "title": "Regeneration of peroxiredoxins during recovery after oxidative stress: only some overoxidized peroxiredoxins can be reduced during recovery after oxidative stress.",

  "abstract_text": "Peroxiredoxins (prx) are redox enzymes using an activated cysteine as their active site. This activated cysteine can be easily overoxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid or cysteine sulfonic acid, especially under oxidative stress conditions. The regeneration of peroxiredoxins after a short, intense oxidative stress was studied, using a proteomics approach. Important differences in regeneration speed were found, prx2 being the fastest regenerated protein, followed by prx1, whereas prx3 and prx6 were regenerated very slowly. Further study of the mechanism of this regeneration by pulse-chase experiments using stable isotope labeling and cycloheximide demonstrated that the fast-regenerating peroxiredoxins are regenerated at least in part by a retroreduction mechanism. This demonstrates that the overoxidation can be reversible under certain conditions. The pathway of this retroreduction and the reasons explaining the various regeneration speeds of the peroxiredoxins remain to be elucidated.",
