    "abstract_text": "Bacillus amyloliquefaciens extracellular RNase has been previously cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. Site-specific mutagenesis experiments have identified codon -39 as the start site of translation. We have determined the primary signal peptide cleavage site of preprobarnase and propose a pathway for the conversion of probarnase to mature barnase.",
