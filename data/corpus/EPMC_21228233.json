  "title": "Herpes simplex virus requires VP11/12 to activate Src family kinase-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling.",

  "abstract_text": "We previously showed that the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein VP11/12 activates the lymphocyte-specific Src family kinase (SFK) Lck and is tyrosine phosphorylated in an Lck-dependent manner during T cell infection. We now extend these findings to show that ectopic expression of Lck induces robust tyrosine phosphorylation of VP11/12 in Vero cells, strongly suggesting that VP11/12 participates in an Lck-mediated signaling pathway as a substrate of Lck or a kinase activated by Lck. We sought to elucidate signaling events downstream of VP11/12-SFK interactions. SFKs lie upstream of the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway in signaling emanating from immune receptors, growth factor receptors, and polyomavirus middle T antigen. Here, we show that VP11/12 is required for virus-induced activation of PI3K-Akt signaling in HSV-infected Jurkat T cells and primary fibroblasts. VP11/12 interacts with PI3K or PI3K signaling complexes during infection, suggesting that VP11/12 activates PI3K directly. SFK activity is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of VP11/12, VP11/12-PI3K interactions, and Akt activation in infected fibroblasts, suggesting that SFK-dependent phosphorylation of VP11/12 is required for interactions with downstream signaling effectors. Akt controls many biological functions, including cell survival, cell motility, and translation, but it is currently unclear which Akt targets are modulated by VP11/12 during infection. Although the Akt target mTORC1 is activated during HSV-1 infection, VP11/12 is not required for this effect, implying that one or more additional viral proteins regulate this pathway. Further studies are therefore required to determine which Akt targets and associated biological functions are uniquely modulated by VP11/12.",
