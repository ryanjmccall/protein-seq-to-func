  "abstract_text": "The thiol amino acid homocysteine (HC) accumulates in homocystinuria and homocyst(e)inemia, and is associated with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. To determine whether HC influences the cell's program of gene expression, vascular endothelial cells were treated with HC for 6-42 h and analyzed by differential display. We found a 3-7-fold, time-dependent induction of a 220-base pair fragment, which demonstrated complete sequence identity with elongation factor-1delta (EF-1delta), a member of the multimeric complex regulating mRNA translation. Fibroblasts from cystathionine beta-synthase -/- individuals also showed up to 3.0-fold increased levels of mRNA for EF-1alpha, -beta, and -delta when compared with normal cells, and treatment of normal cells with the HC precursor, methionine, induced a 1.5-2.0-fold increase in EF-1alpha, -beta, and -delta mRNA. This induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide and reflected a doubling in the rate of gene transcription in nuclear run-on analyses. In HC-treated endothelial cells, pulse-chase studies revealed a doubling in the rate of synthesis of the thiol-containing protein, annexin II, but no change in synthesis of the cysteineless protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Thus, HC induces expression of a family of acute translational response genes through a protein synthesis-dependent transcriptional mechanism. This process may mediate accelerated synthesis of free thiol-containing proteins in response to HC-induced oxidative stress.",
