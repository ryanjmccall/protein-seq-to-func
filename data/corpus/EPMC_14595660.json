    "abstract_text": "We present the clinicopathological features of two siblings from a consanguineous marriage who presented with respiratory hypoventilation and died 10 days and 4 years later, respectively. This disorder showed extensive tau neuropathology, and both had a novel homozygous S352L tau gene mutation. This is the first description of a pathologically proved young-onset tauopathy with apparent recessive inheritance.",
