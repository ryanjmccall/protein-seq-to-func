  "abstract_text": "Serum levels of cystatin C, an endogenous cysteine proteinase inhibitor, are often used as an indicator of glomerular filtration rate. Although it is known that cystatin C is filtered by glomeruli and metabolized in proximal tubule cells (PTC), the precise molecular mechanism underlying this process is undetermined. Using quartz-crystal microbalance analyses, we demonstrate that cystatin C binds directly to megalin, an endocytic receptor in PTC, in a Ca(+)-dependent manner. We also find that cystatin C is endocytosed specifically via megalin in rat yolk sac epithelium-derived L2 cells which share a variety of characteristics with PTC. Finally, in vivo studies using kidney-specific megalin knockout mice provide evidence that megalin mediates proximal tubular uptake of cystatin C. We conclude that megalin is an endocytic receptor of cystatin C in PTC.",
