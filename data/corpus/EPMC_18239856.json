  "abstract_text": "Heat shock (HS) response is a universal mechanism of protection against adverse environmental conditions. It is manifested mainly by rapid and robust induction of molecular chaperones and other cytoprotective proteins. In higher eukaryotes the activation of the HS response is mediated by a master regulator, heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). Here we outline recent progress in understanding the early steps in HSF1 activation by heat in the context of existing models of HSF1 regulation.",
