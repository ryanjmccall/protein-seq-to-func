  "abstract_text": "The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (IL-2R) consists of three distinct subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma c) and regulates proliferation of T lymphocytes. Intracellular signalling results from ligand-mediated heterodimerization of the cytoplasmic domains of the beta and gamma c chains. To identify the residues of gamma c critical to this process, mutations were introduced into the cytoplasmic domain, and the effects on signalling were analyzed in the IL-2-dependent T-cell line CTLL2 and T-helper clone D10, using chimeric IL-2R chains that bind and are activated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Whereas previous studies of fibroblasts and transformed T cells have suggested that signalling by gamma c requires both membrane-proximal and C-terminal subdomains, our results for IL-2-dependent T cells demonstrate that the membrane-proximal 52 amino acids are sufficient to mediate a normal proliferative response, including induction of the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-fos. Although gamma c is phosphorylated on tyrosine upon receptor activation and could potentially interact with downstream molecules containing SH2 domains, cytoplasmic tyrosine residues were dispensable for mitogenic signalling. However, deletion of a membrane-proximal region conserved among other cytokine receptors (cytoplasmic residues 5 to 37) or an adjacent region unique to gamma c (residues 40 to 52) abrogated functional interaction of the receptor chain with the tyrosine kinase Jak3. This correlated with a loss of all signalling events analyzed, including phosphorylation of the IL-2R beta-associated kinase Jak1, expression of c-myc and c-fos, and induction of the proliferative response. Thus, it appears in T cells that Jak3 is a critical mediator of mitogenic signaling by the gamma c chain.",
