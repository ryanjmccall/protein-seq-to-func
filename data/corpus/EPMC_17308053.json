  "abstract_text": "Through genome-wide expression profile analysis for non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), we found overexpression of a Myc-associated protein with JmjC domain (MAPJD) gene in the great majority of NSCLC cases. Induction of exogenous expression of MAPJD into NIH3T3 cells conferred growth-promoting activity. Concordantly, in vitro suppression of MAPJD expression with small interfering RNA effectively suppressed growth of NSCLC cells, in which MAPJD was overexpressed. We found four candidate MAPJD target genes, SBNO1, TGFBRAP1, RIOK1, and RASGEF1A, which were the most significantly induced by exogenous MAPJD expression. Through interaction with MYC protein, MAPJD transactivates a set of genes, including kinases and cell signal transducers that are possibly related to proliferation of lung cancer cells. As our data imply that MAPJD is a novel member of the MYC transcriptional complex and its activation is a common feature of lung cancer, selective suppression of this pathway could be a promising therapeutic target for treatment of lung cancers.",
