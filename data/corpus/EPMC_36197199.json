Introduction Breast cancer, the most frequently diagnosed and reported cause of death, threatens women’s health in many countries. [ 1 ] Certain factors play an important role in protecting against breast cancer development, including late menarche and more nursing duration. [ 2 – 4 ] Ovarian hormone exposure, the number of ovulatory cycles, and breast lobular differentiation are suggested to reduce the occurrence of breast cancer. [ 5 – 7 ] Researchers have evaluated the effects of reproductive factors on BRCA -related breast cancer, but the results are conflicting and differ by mutations either in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . [ 8 – 10 ] Few studies suggest no impact of breastfeeding on breast cancer development, but few have reported its protective effect on breast cancer risk in BRCA1 carriers. [ 11 – 13 ] Breastfeeding did not show any impact on breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers. [ 10 ] In 2020, 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer, and it caused 685,000 deaths worldwide. At the end of 2020, 7.8 million women living with breast cancer ranked it the most prevalent cancer globally. [ 14 ] Breast cancer and recent trends in its research are topics of prime importance. [ 15 ] The importance of quantitative and qualitative assessment of the available scientific literature in this field has increased. Such assessments can play a key role in funding concerning research projects and resource priority setting, as demonstrated in the Research Assessment Exercise. [ 16 ] The bibliometric analysis introduces a review process that allows the published research to be better described, evaluated, and monitored. It covers quantitative and visual processes in scientific publications to define their characteristics and dynamics. Bibliometric studies are either evaluation or relational studies. Evaluation studies estimate the number of cited papers and total citations. Relational studies talk about the structure of a research issue, research profiling of authors, institutional affiliations, new research avenues, and scientific techniques employed. Appropriate interpretation is very important in bibliometric studies. [ 17 ] The present study aims to identify and analyze the top 100 most cited papers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated breast and ovarian cancers worldwide using comprehensive data analysis and bibliometric tools. Furthermore, this study can help researchers and policymakers devise policies regarding the diagnosis and treatment of breast and ovarian cancers. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design A descriptive bibliometric study was conducted. 2.2. Search strategy and database A comprehensive review and discussion regarding the topic took place before conducting the online search to decide the retrieval database and potential search keywords. On June 07, 2021, the online search was performed through the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database hosted by Clarivate Analytics ( https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/ ), previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA (Fig. 1 ). Figure 1. Study flow chart. The WoSCC database is the world’s oldest database. [ 18 ] Previously published studies in different research fields utilized WoSCC databases. [ 19 – 27 ] The WoSCC database was accessed through the online library portal of Southeast University, Nanjing, China ( http://www.lib.seu.edu.cn/ ). The potential search keywords were entered in the database search engine using Boolean search operators “ BRCA1 ” OR “ BRCA2 ” in the title field without restrictions. 2.3. Selection of publications Researchers in this study independently screened the retrieved documents to identify the top 100 most cited publications on BRCA1 - and BRCA2 -related breast and ovarian cancer. The disagreements were resolved after a discussion with the third researcher. Only publications that focused on BRCA1 and BRCA2 causing breast and ovarian cancer were included in the final analysis. The top 100 most cited publications were identified based on the number of global citation score (GCS) in descending order, and publications that had more citations were ranked higher. 2.4. Extraction of data A self-designed electronic data form was designed for data collection. After selecting the top 100 most cited publications, major key attributes were extracted from the data. For this purpose, the data were exported into Microsoft Excel 2019 to extract the required data and calculate the frequencies and percentages of the included publications. The following information was extracted: study title, year of publication, journal, authors name, institution, country, publication types, publication language, widely used keywords, and number of citations. The journals’ impact factor (IF) and quartile ranking (Q1–4) were obtained from Incites Journal Citation Reports 2020, released in June 2021 by Clarivate Analytics. The data were downloaded in 2 formats: plain text and comma-separated values. 2.5. Data analysis For data analysis, 3 different tools were used. OriginPro 2018 software was used to generate the relevant graphs. For citation analysis, the data were exported in to HistCite TM software. [ 28 ] Furthermore, the data were plotted for visualization networks using VOSviewer software version 1.6.17 for windows. [ 29 ] In addition, RStudio (biblioshiny package) was used to generate the cloud map, countries’ collaboration, and trend analysis. 2.6. Ethics and consent This study involved no animal and human subjects; therefore, no ethical approval was required. 3. Results 3.1. General characteristics The top 100 most cited papers on BRCA1 and BRCA2 were authored by 932 authors from 24 countries and published in 27 journals. These papers were published between 1994 and 2017. The GCS of these papers was 79,713 (797.1 citations per paper), ranging from 441 to 4671 citations. However, the overall local citation score was 588. The top 100 most cited papers were published in English, of which 93 papers were published as research articles. The overall collaboration among the authors was 9.49. The main facts about the top 100 most cited papers are presented in Table 1 . Table 1 Main facts about the top 100 most cited papers.

Keywords and trend topics analysis The minimum number of occurrences of a keyword was fixed at 5, while the minimum cluster size was 10. Of the total KeyWords Plus (n = 411), only 45 met the threshold, and were plotted into 3 clusters, and each color represented a different cluster; red color (cluster 1, n = 17), green color (cluster 2, n = 15), and blue color (cluster 3, 13), as shown in Figure 3 A. The most frequently appearing KeyWords Plus were ovarian-cancer (n = 31), breast-cancer (n = 20), mutations (n = 16), gene (n = 12), familial breast (n = 11), families (n = 10), germline mutations (n = 10), susceptibility gene (n = 10), women (n = 10), and protein (n = 9). However, the frequently used author’s keywords were BRCA1 (n = 3), DNA repair (n = 3), and cancer (n = 2), as shown in Figure 3 B. In recent times, the trend topics based on title were patients, mutations, carriers, ovarian, and risk, as shown in Figure 3 C. The factorial analysis map was generated based on multiple correspondence analysis method as shown in Figure 3 D. The field was selected as KeyWords Plus. The data were plotted into 2 clusters; cluster 1 (red color) and cluster 2 (blue color). Cluster 1 is grouped by ovarian cancer, breast cancer, mutations, gene, familial breast, families, germline mutations, and other topics related to cancer, women, risk, protein, expressions, identification, in vivo, linkage, carcinoma, prevalence, recombination, and therapy. Cluster 2 is grouped by homology directed repair, tumors, and defect. Figure 3.

Discussion This study is the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the top 100 most cited papers on BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated breast and ovarian cancer globally. Each year, 1.3 million breast cancer cases are diagnosed globally, which is the most common invasive cancer in females. [ 40 ] BRCA1 and BRCA2 are among the most common genes implicated in the progression of breast and ovarian cancer. Therefore, it is important for the scientific community to identify and study the most influential papers in the field. This analysis can help fulfill the missing gaps, provide the recent and potential trends in this area, and direct attention to the critical aspects that have not been addressed yet. The outcomes of this study include the most prolific authors, most published journals, most active institutions, highly contributing countries, keywords and trend topics analysis, and citations count. In our analysis, the most published journal was Nature Genetics which published 11 articles, while Science published 10, and New England Journal of Medicine published only 5 articles among the top 100 cited articles. The IF of Nature Genetics is the lowest compared to the other 2 journals. This phenomenon indicates that the relevancy of a journal to the nature of study plays a vital role than the IF of a journal. In this study, the overall GCS was 79,713 (ranging from 441 to 4671 citations), while the local citation score was 588 (ranging from 1 to 43 citations). In the top 100 most cited papers, 5 papers were cited more than 2000 times (2144–4671 citations), 10 papers were cited more than 1000 times (1014–1635 citations), 58 papers were cited at least 500 times (500–986 citations), while the remaining papers (n = 27) were cited more than 400 times (441–494 citations). Generally, papers published in relevant and reputed journals with important public health issues attract more readers and can be cited multiple times. In the current study, no smooth ascending or descending trend in the year-wise citations was observed. This variation may be due to the current trends in the field, as the BRCA study tends more to the diagnosis while treatment is a crucial step after the diagnosis. Scientists may have focused on other aspects of the disease. The included studies were mainly based on experimental work, that is, research articles (93%). This indicates that the research emphasis has been directed toward diagnosis, treatment, and applications rather than literature-based work. All the 100 top-cited papers were published in English, which is the leading scientific language used globally for research dissemination. The University of Pennsylvania was the top leading institution in terms of publications, while the most cited institution was the University of Cambridge. In this category, universities remained on top while hospitals and centers remained on the bottom. This trend highlights the understandable fact of different objectives of universities and hospitals. Among the countries involved in the top 100 cited papers, the USA was the leading country in terms of publications, citations, and collaboration. This trend is in line with many other studies in various research fields. [ 41 – 50 ] None of the resource-limited countries were involved in the highly influential studies as the main contributor or leader. This trend has various reasons, for which funding allocation by any country is the most important. In the USA, research and development is funded by a number of sectors, including the federal government, academia, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and state governments for a variety of purposes. As a result, in the 20th century, the USA has become a global leader in research and development. [ 51 – 52 ] During the period between 2003 and 2007, studies were conducted on the topics related to patients, mutations, carriers, ovarian, and risk factors. However, an examination of the top 10 most cited studies indicates that 90% of the studies focused on diagnosis, while 10% focused on treatment. It is observed that after performing certain work on diagnosis, the scientist moved to treatment as the main aim of diagnosis is to use this information for treatment. This trend has shown a ray of hope that scientists have assessed this problem and are seriously working to solve it step by step. [ 53 ] Another study found that GD2 could be used as a monitoring target in clinical isolates from breast cancer patients. [ 54 ] This study will not only be important for medical practitioners but also for policymakers for better decisions. More research needs to be carried out in this field, and researchers, especially from disease burdened countries, should be encouraged to carry out research and share their findings in peer-reviewed journals. 5. Conclusion This bibliometric study should boldly call out that the vast majority of the most influential papers originate from the USA, the UK, and Canada, clustering around well-known institutions. Interestingly, these contributions are well respected and deeply appreciated. However, it would benefit the community at large to have industry and individual government funding directed more towards high-quality research and peer-reviewed research publications in low-income countries. The most frequently appearing keywords were ovarian-cancer, breast-cancer, mutations, gene, and familial breast. In recent times, the trend topics were patients, mutations, carriers, ovarian, and risk. A better understanding of breast and ovarian cancer’s clinical features along with screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the community may lead to timely diagnosis and management. This can partially lead to a better quality of life for the patients and can help to reduce the occurrence of hereditary breast cancer in future generations. 6. Limitations This study has some limitations. Firstly, only the WoSCC database was utilized. Secondly, the search was limited to the title field. Thirdly, the self-cations of the authors were not excluded. Therefore, the above limitations may bias the frequency of publications frequency and citation score.

To characterize important attributes of the top 100 most cited papers in breast and ovarian cancer-related BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Overall, the papers included in the current study were cited 79,713 times (ranging from 441 to 4671). The most published journal was Nature Genetics. The most productive country was the USA. However, collaborations with developed countries are needed to promote breast cancer research in developing countries.

  "plain_text": "This study aimed to identify, characterize, and map the important attributes of the top 100 most cited papers on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The scientific literature on BRCA1 and BRCA2 was searched in the Web of Science Core Collection database using the keywords “ BRCA1 ” OR “ BRCA2 ” (Title). The top 100 most cited papers were selected based on citations. The obtained data were exported into HistCite TM , RStudio, and VOSviewer software for prerequisite analysis. The top 100 most cited papers on BRCA1 and BRCA2 were authored by 932 authors from 24 countries and published in 27 journals. These papers were cited 79,713 times, ranging from 441 to 4671 citations. The highly cited paper was cited 4671 times and published in Science (1994). The leading author, journal, publication year, institution, and country were Easton DF (n = 16), Nature Genetics (n = 11), 2002 (n = 11), University of Pennsylvania (n = 17), and the USA (n = 76), respectively. The results show that all the top 100 papers were produced in developed countries. The collaboration index among the authors was 9.49. The most frequently appeared keywords were ovarian-cancer, breast-cancer, mutations, gene, and familial breast. In recent times, the trend topics were patients, mutations, carriers, ovarian, and risk."
