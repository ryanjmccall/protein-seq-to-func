Keywords miR-3200 Liver cancer cells RAB7A Telomere 1 Introduction Researches indicate miR-3200 is closely related to tumorigenesis. For examples, miR-3200 promotes ferroptosis by targeting ATF4, increasing cell proliferation and metastasis [ 1 ].Moreover, miR-3200 exerts tumor-suppressive effects [ 2 ]and miR-3200 promotes cell invasion via BRMS1 suppression[ 3 ]. Also,miR-3200 promotes the development of gastric carcinoma [ 4 ]and miR-3200 regulates the proliferation and metastasis by suppressing the expression of CAMK2A [ 5 ]. In particular, knockdown of long non-coding RNA PEG10 inhibits growth, migration and invasion of gastric carcinoma cells via up-regulating miR-3200 [ 6 ], and silencing of LINC00324 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells through regulating the miR-3200-5p/BCAT1 axis [ 7 ]. However, the role of miR-3200 in human hepatocarcinogenesis are still unclear. The research suggests RAB7A shuttles between late endosomes and mitochondria to enable mitophagy [ 8 ] and RAB7A promotes the migration of MSCs [ 9 ]. Up to now, the roles of RAB7a has not been fully elucidated in human hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, we clearly demonstrate that miR-3200 affects transcriptome, proteome,and some signaling pathway in liver cancer and accelerate the growth of liver cancer cells through RAB7A. These results are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of human liver cancer, so it is worth further study. 2 Materials and methods Cell Lines, Lentivirus Human liver cancer cell line (Hep3B) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium(Gibco) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (Gibco) in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C. rLV, rLV-miR-3200 were purchased from Wu Han viraltherapy Technologies Co.

Fig. 7 4 Discussion To date, we clearly demonstrate that miR-3200 affects transcriptome, proteome,and some signaling pathways in liver cancer and accelerates the growth of liver cancer cells through RAB7A and telomere remodeling( Fig. 7 J). These results are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of human liver cancer. Obviously, these findings are noteworthy that miR-3200 affects the transcriptional regulation for several genes, including RAB7A, SQSTM1,CDK1,ABCE1,BECN1,PTEN. The study indicates p62/SQSTM1 is a stress-inducible cellular protein, which interacts with various signaling proteins to regulate a variety of cellular functions [ 10 ] and SQSTM1/p62 activates NFE2L2/NRF2 and protects mouse liver from lipotoxicity [ 11 ].Moreover, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) promotes phosphorylation of RAPTOR, causing dissociation of mTORC1 [ 12 ], and CDK1 was identified as a positive regulator of global translation [ 13 ].Also, ABCE1mediated the progression of N-MYC\u2013driven and c-MYC\u2013driven cancers [ 14 ]. Furthermore,miR-153 inhibits the resistance of lung cancer to gefitinib dependent on ABCE1 [ 15 ]. In particular, the downregulation of PTEN promotes proliferative of bladder cancer cells [ 16 ]. We speculate that these genes play an important role in the carcinogenic function of miR-3200, but further research is needed. It is worth mentioning that miR-3200 affects the transcriptional ability of several genes, such as, GEN1\uff0cTMTC4\uff0c TSC22D1\uff0c SGK1, ITGB5\uff0cSNX1, SUV39H1, CBX5,HOXA7, RAD54L.The study indicates that the immunotherapy based on GEN1 is good for ovarian cancer [ 17 ]. Moreover, the deletion of TMTC4 activates the unfolded protein [ 18 ]. Also, RNA-binding protein MEX3D promotes cervical carcinoma tumorigenesis by destabilizing TSC22D1 (TSC22 domain family protein 1) Mrna [ 19 ]. In particular, serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1), a member of the \u2018AGC\u2019 subfamily of protein kinases, inhibits autophagy-dependent apoptosis via the mTOR-Foxo3a pathway [ 20 ]. Strikingly, SNHG16 promotes neuroblastoma progression [ 21 ]. In addition, RAD54L promotes progression of bladder cancer [ 22 ]. Thus, we infer that these genes play an important role in the carcinogenic function of miR-3200, but further research is needed. On the other hand, it is obvious that miR-3200 affects the translational ability of several genes, such as,ACTG1,PRKAR2B, EIFAD,MYOF, TMEM91\uff0cHSPA2,KDM2A, AATF, OCIAD1, SPTLC2. It has been reported that the overexpression of Actin gamma 1 (ACTG1) could promote hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation by regulating the cell cycle in HCC cells [ 23 ].Moreover, RRAD suppresses the Warburg effect by downregulating ACTG1 in hepatocellularcarcinoma [ 24 ]. Also, PRKAR2B promotes aerobic glycolysis and tumour growth in prostate cancer [ 25 ]. And myoferlin affects tumor aggressiveness [ 26 ]. In addition, HSPA2 promotes proliferation via ERK1/2 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma [ 27 ].Interestingly, RNF144A functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer [ 28 ] and KDM2A promotes proliferation [ 29 ]. So, we speculate that these genes play an important role in the carcinogenic function of miR-3200, but further research is needed. In particular, our results suggest that miR-3200 enhances Rab7A in liver cancer. The study suggests that Rab7A influences AKT and PAK activity, which favors cell migration [ 30 ]. Also, Rab7A functioned as an oncogene in breast cancer [ 31 ].In particular, RAB7A phosphorylation promotes mitophagy via the PINK-PARKIN pathway [ 32 ]. Strikingly, our findings indicate miR-3200 some signaling pathway in liver cancer, including cell cycle signaling pathway, carbon metabolism signaling pathway, DNA replication pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, serine and threonine metabolism signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, amino acid metabolism signaling pathway, RNA degradation signaling pathway, Fatty acid biosynthesis signaling pathway, Tyrosine metabolism signaling pathway, Biosynthesis of amino acids signaling pathway, Fatty acid degradation signaling pathway, carcinogenesis-receptor activation signaling pathway, autophagy signaling pathway. The activity of cell-cycle proteins is tightly controlled by their cell-cycle-specific transcription, protein degradation, as well as by several CDK inhibitor proteins [ 33 ]. Also, arginine methylation of several proteins is prevalent in breast, lung and colon cancers and leukaemia [ 34 ].Moreover, the synthesis and consumption of pyruvate is tightly controlled and is often differentially regulated in cancer cells [ 35 ]. In particular, the increased glucose consumption can be observed with clinical tumour imaging [ 36 ]. Interestingly, a conserved MST-FOXO signaling pathway mediates oxidative-stress responses and extends life span [ 37 ] and the Hippo-signaling pathway is an important regulator of cellular proliferation and organ size. Moreover, Hippo pathway activity is essential for the maintenance of the differentiated hepatocyte state([ 38 , 39 ]. In addition, DNA mismatch repair promotes APOBEC3-mediated diffuse hypermutation in human cancers [ 40 ]. Also, PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway promotes neuronal differentiation [ 41 ] . Thus, we speculate that these signaling pathways play an important role in the carcinogenic functions of miR-3200. In summary, miR-3200 affects transcriptome, proteome,and some signaling pathway in human liver cancer and accelerate the growth of liver cancer cells through enhancing RAB7A and telomere remodeling. These results are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of human liver cancer, so it is worth further study.

    "full_text_abstract": "Researches indicate miR-3200 is closely related to tumorigenesis, However, the role of miR-3200 in human hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. In this study, we clearly demonstrate that miR-3200 accelerates the growth of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Obviously, these findings are noteworthy that miR-3200 affects the transcriptional regulation for several genes, including DSP\uff0cBABAM2, Rab7A,SQSTM1,PRKAG2,CDK1,ABCE1,BECN1,PTEN,UPRT. And miR-3200 affects the transcriptional ability of several genes, such as, upregulating CADPS, DSP,FBXO32, PPCA,SGK1, PATXN7L1, PLK2,ITGB5,FZD3,HOXC8,HSPA1A,C-Myc,CyclnD1,CyclinE,PCNA and down \u2013regulating SUV39H1, MYO1G, OLFML3, CBX5, PPDE2A, HOXA7, RAD54L, CDC45,SHMT7,MAD2L1,P27,IQGAP3,PTEN,P57,SCAMP3,etc...On the other hand, it is obvious that miR-3200 affects the translational ability of several genes, such as, upregulating GNS,UPRT,EIFAD,YOS1,SGK1,K-Ras,PKM2,C-myc,Pim1,CyclinD1,mTOR,erbB-2,CyclinE,PCNA,RRAS,ARAF,RAPH1,etc.. and down-regulating KDM2A, AATF, TMM17B, RAB8B, MYO1G,P21WAF1/Cip1,GADD45,PTEN,P27,P18,P57,SERBP1,RPL34,UFD1,Bax,ANXA6,GSK3\u03b2. Strikingly, miR-3200 affects some signaling pathway in liver cancer, including carbon metabolism signaling pathway, DNA replication pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, serine and threonine metabolism signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, Fatty acid biosynthesis signaling pathway, carcinogenesis-receptor activation signaling pathway, autophagy signaling pathway. Furthermore, our results suggest that miR-3200 enhances expression of RAB7A, and then Rab7A regulates the carcinogenic function of miR-3200 by increasing telomere remodeling in human liver cancer. These results are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of human liver cancer."
