  "abstract_text": "A remarkable property of the machinery for import of peroxisomal matrix proteins is that it can accept already folded proteins as substrates. This import involves binding of newly synthesized proteins by cytosolic peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5) followed by insertion of the PEX5-cargo complex into the peroxisomal membrane at the docking/translocation module (DTM). However, how these processes occur remains largely unknown. Here, we used truncated PEX5 molecules to probe the DTM architecture. We found that the DTM can accommodate a larger number of truncated PEX5 molecules comprising amino acid residues 1-197 than full-length PEX5 molecules. A shorter PEX5 version (PEX5(1-125)) still interacted correctly with the DTM; however, this species was largely accessible to exogenously added proteinase K, suggesting that this protease can access the DTM occupied by a small PEX5 protein. Interestingly, the PEX5(1-125)-DTM interaction was inhibited by a polypeptide comprising PEX5 residues 138-639. Apparently, the DTM can recruit soluble PEX5 through interactions with different PEX5 domains, suggesting that the PEX5-DTM interactions are to some degree fuzzy. Finally, we found that the interaction between PEX5 and PEX14, a major DTM component, is stable at pH 11.5. Thus, there is no reason to assume that the hitherto intriguing resistance of DTM-bound PEX5 to alkaline extraction reflects its direct contact with the peroxisomal lipid bilayer. Collectively, these results suggest that the DTM is best described as a large cavity-forming protein assembly into which cytosolic PEX5 can enter to release its cargo.",
