Introduction Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) stands as an intricate autoimmune inflammatory ailment, inciting joint inflammation and emerging as the most prevalent variant of inflammatory arthritis, impacting approximately 0.5% to 1% of the global populace. [ 1 , 2 ] Its occurrence registers 2 to 3 times higher among women in comparison to men. [ 3 ] Familial factors contribute to the condition in 40% to 65% of seropositive patients and 20% of seronegative patients. [ 4 ] The 2010 edition of RA diagnostic criteria comprises 4 facets: joint engagement, serological anomalies ascertained through RFs and ACPAs assessments, heightened indicators of acute inflammatory response, and arthritis duration. [ 5 ] Notably, RF measurements usually yield negative results in early RA. [ 6 ] Similarly, the ACPAs test exhibits low sensitivity in RA diagnosis. [ 7 ] Consequently, the novel RA classification criteria exhibit their imperfections as well, underscoring the significance of identifying novel serological biomarkers with substantial clinical utility to enhance RA diagnosis. In terms of treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs represent commonplace interventions for RA. However, they often accompany side effects and demonstrate limited efficacy. [ 8 , 9 ] Although the precise etiology of RA remains elusive, it is generally attributed to a blend of epigenetic alterations, immune dysregulation, and environmental influences. [ 10 ] DNA methylation emerges as the quintessential epigenetic modification in humans, intimately linked with immune dysregulation. [ 11 \u2013 13 ] Furthermore, RA-related DNA methylation patterns exhibit site-specific variances linked to immune pathways. [ 14 ] Recognizing the potential reversibility of epigenetic alterations, probing epigenetic malfunctions in autoimmune disorders has the capacity to uncover novel biomarkers and innovative therapeutic targets. Bibliometric analysis, a systematic and quantitative technique for scrutinizing scientific literature, assumes a pivotal role in research endeavors. It expedites the comprehension of epigenetic trends within rheumatoid arthritis, facilitating the identification of eminent authors and prolific research institutions, while swiftly pinpointing high-confidence, compelling research areas. [ 15 ] Herein, we undertake a visual analysis and synthesis of DNA methylation trends in rheumatoid arthritis, offering insights into the role of DNA methylation in the mechanisms, diagnostics, and treatments of this condition. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data source The source data for this investigation were obtained from the Web of Science core collection database, with publication dates restricted to the period from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2022. We limited the article types to \u201cArticle\u201d and \u201cReview\u201d exclusively. Two researchers independently conducted the retrieval process using the following search formula: TS=(\u201cepigenetic\u201d or \u201cepigenomic\u201d or \u201cmethylation\u201d or \u201cacetylation\u201d or \u201cDNA methylation\u201d or \u201cmethylat *\u201d) AND TS=(\u201crheumatoid arthritis\u201d or \u201carthritis\u201d or \u201crheumatic disease\u201d or \u201crheuma * \u201cOr\u201d arthrit * \u201cor\u201d polyarthrit * \u201cor\u201d rheumatic diseases \u201c) as of April 20, 2023. We restricted the language to English. A total of 2014 articles were retrieved, and 214 articles that did not meet the criteria were excluded. Finally, 1800 valid articles were downloaded in plain text format and saved as \u201cdownload *,\u201d as depicted in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Flowchart for search process. For visual analysis, we employed CiteSpace (version 6.1.6R), [ 16 , 17 ] VOSviewer (version 1.6.18), and COOC (version 13.7) to facilitate data visualization. [ 18 , 25 ] Bibliometric analysis, encompassing clustering, co-occurrence, co-citation, and coauthor analyses, [ 19 ] was employed as the principal analytical approach. The most frequently employed metric in this study was co-citation, which highlights the influence of cited articles. [ 20 \u2013 22 ] We collected fundamental data including authorship, institutional affiliations, geographical locations, journals, keywords, and references. CiteSpace served as our tool for conducting author, reference, and journal analyses. Additionally, we explored citing bursts in literature and the recurrence of new references and keywords. [ 23 ] The interplay between citing and cited journals was depicted using a dual-map overlay of journals. Parameters were set as follows: the timeframe was selected from 2003 to 2022 with a yearly interval of 1, and all options in the term source were chosen sequentially, followed by node type selection and criteria (k = 25). In the graph, each node represents an observation, with node size denoting frequency\u2014larger nodes indicating higher frequencies. Connections between nodes signify collaboration, co-occurrence, or co-reference relationships. Node colors correspond to different years; colors from inner to outer circles represent the years from 2003 to 2022. VOSviewer, another bibliometric software, was employed for creating and visualizing bibliometric maps. This software provides a summary table interface and conducts a comprehensive, in-depth bibliometric analysis. It differs from conventional bibliometric procedures [ 24 ] in its emphasis on graphical representations of bibliometric data. Each node on the VOSviewer map corresponds to a specific parameter, such as country/region, journal, or keyword, and node sizes are determined by properties such as the number of publications, frequency of appearance, or citation counts. Nodes and lines are categorized into clusters based on the clusters they belong to, determining their colors. Connections are depicted as lines connecting nodes. COOC, an emerging bibliometric software, complements the analyses conducted using CiteSpace and VOSviewer by providing additional measurement results. [ 25 ] 3. Results 3.1. Analysis of annual publications In this study, we analyzed a total of 1800 articles related to DNA methylation in the context of rheumatoid arthritis. We conducted a visual examination of publication trends using Co-Occurrence 12.9, [ 25 ] as shown in Figure 2 . The analysis of DNA methylation in rheumatoid arthritis revealed a consistent upward trajectory, reaching its peak of 197 articles in 2022. This trend indicates sustained and growing interest in this research area. Figure 2. Annual publications of DNA methylation in RA from 2003 to 2022. 3.2.

Discussion 4.1. Basic profile of DNA methylation in rheumatoid arthritis A total of 1800 pertinent articles were retrieved in this study. In recent years, there has been a growing interest among researchers in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying rheumatoid arthritis, leading to the emergence of a prolific group of authors, including prominent names such as Gay Steffen, Lu Qianjin, and Ospelt Caroline. In terms of national and regional contributions, the United States takes the lead in this field, with University Hospital Zurich being a prolific publisher of related studies. The most frequently cited authors and references often center on epidemiological aspects and the characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis. The top 4 keywords that are both highly frequent and prominent include \u201crheumatoid arthritis,\u201d \u201cDNA methylation,\u201d \u201cexpression,\u201d and \u201cgene expression.\u201d Emerging research hotspots are indicated by keywords such as \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d \u201cpathogenesis,\u201d \u201cepigenetic,\u201d \u201cDNA methylation,\u201d \u201crheumatoid arthritis,\u201d and \u201cautoimmune disease.\u201d These keywords shed light on the evolving trends and emerging areas of interest in the study of rheumatoid arthritis and DNA methylation. 4.2. Hotspot analysis of DNA methylation in rheumatoid arthritis This study highlights the current research hotspots in the field of rheumatoid arthritis, which include \u201cepigenetic regulation,\u201d \u201cpathogenesis,\u201d and \u201cepigenome-wide association.\u201d Among various epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation stands out as the most extensively studied due to its numerous advantages over other epigenetic modifications. Notably, DNA methylation can be stably inherited through multiple cell divisions. [ 26 ] This process is mediated by a family of enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). [ 27 ] In humans, DNA methylation primarily occurs within CpG islands, which are regions rich in cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites. Approximately 60% to 70% of annotated gene promoters are associated with CpG islands, making the methylation of these islands pivotal in regulating gene expression. [ 15 ] Numerous studies have explored DNA methylation-targeting drugs, such as 2-deoxy-5-azacitidine, decitabine, and zebularine, [ 28 \u2013 30 ] in the context of treating various types of cancer and rheumatic diseases. Some research suggests that 5\u2019-AZA-mediated demethylation of the interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene may inhibit the development of RA by enhancing the production of the immunosuppressive IL-10. [ 31 ] Additionally, a novel DNMT inhibitor called SGI-1027, a lipophilic, quinoline-based compound, has been identified. It causes the degradation of DNMT1 and demethylation of genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 3. [ 32 ] On another note, the DNA methyltransferase activator budesonide has shown promise in increasing DNA methylation levels and improving tender and swollen joint counts in RA patients. [ 33 ] Turning to the aspect of pathogenesis, recent research has uncovered several potential triggers for rheumatoid arthritis. Substantial evidence points to smoking as a causative factor for seropositivity in RA and RA-related interstitial lung disease. [ 34 , 35 ] Furthermore, not only inhalation of cigarette smoke but also exposure of the respiratory tract to various factors, including asthma, [ 36 ] COVID-19, [ 37 ] as well as environmental factors such as coal dust, silica, industrial particles, [ 38 ] and air pollutants from traffic, [ 39 ] can contribute to the development of RA. Diet also emerges as a significant factor, with studies indicating that the gut epithelium and the gut microbiota play critical roles in maintaining barrier function and inflammation in the gut and colon. [ 40 \u2013 42 ] Angelica polysaccharide has been found to modulate the intestinal microbiota and alter the expression of genes such as Cldn5, Slit3, and Rgs18, ultimately improving RA. [ 43 ] Regarding epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), RA is recognized as a complex autoimmune disease. [ 44 ] These studies have underscored the influence of cellular phenotypes on the etiology and outcomes of complex diseases, with genomic DNA modification through epigenetic mechanisms playing a pivotal role in these effects. [ 45 , 46 ] EWAS can mitigate the risk of false positives often encountered in studies and reveal significant regulatory relationships between the epigenome and RA through the analysis of large-scale methylation quantitative trait loci. [ 47 ] Furthermore, EWAS can identify common apparent mutations in disease by detecting the distribution of methyl groups. For instance, changes in the pathogenic activity of B cells attributed to DNA methylation are strongly associated with RA. [ 48 ] 4.3. Hotspots and emerging frontiers of DNA methylation in RA Analyzing citation trends, we have identified 2 keywords, \u201cdiagnosis\u201d and \u201cmesenchymal stem cells,\u201d that experienced a surge in citations from 2020 to 2022.Diagnosis: DNA methylation has gained prominence as a potential indicator for diagnosing RA. Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving the long-term clinical outcomes of RA patients. A study by RazaK et al demonstrated that early treatment within 12 weeks of disease onset significantly improved outcomes compared to delayed treatment, resulting in a 30% reduction in the latter group. [ 49 ] LairdP. W et al observed DNA methylation changes occurring in the early stages of the disease, suggesting its utility as an early warning indicator. [ 50 ] Targeted methylation sequencing technology has been employed to assess the methylation status of specific CpG sites, including those in the differentially methylated region of HIPK3 in 235 recruited RA patients. [ 51 ] The results indicate that HIPK3 can serve as a new diagnostic marker for RA. Combining HIPK3 with anti-citrullinated protein antibody and rheumatoid factor (RF+) in a prediction model achieved a higher AUC of 0.864. [ 52 ] JiananZhao et al identified significant hypermethylation of the HTR2A promoter region in peripheral blood samples from RA patients, suggesting a potential diagnostic role in rheumatoid arthritis. [ 52 ] GangFang et al identified APOL6 and CCDC88C as potential novel biomarkers of RA, as they are associated with differential methylation sites and play crucial roles in the disease progression. [ 53 ] Additionally, serum circulating miRNA-5196 has shown promise as a biomarker for predicting positive treatment outcomes of TNF-\u03b1 treatment in RA and ankylosing spondylitis patients. [ 54 , 55 ] StanczykJ et al discovered enhanced expression of miRNA-203 in RAFLS, which interacts with hypomethylation of the MMP1 and IL-6 gene promoters, suggesting a potential link between miRNA and DNA methylation in RA pathogenesis. [ 56 ] Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs): Research involving MSCs and their relationship with RA has yielded significant results since 2018. MSCs exhibit multiple functions, including promoting tissue regeneration and immune regulation through their extracellular vesicles. [ 57 ] They can modulate T cell proliferation and differentiation and polarize toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, reducing the production of proinflammatory factors. [ 58 , 59 ] The use of MSCs in treating RA has shown considerable promise, with studies confirming both safety and significant efficacy. [ 60 , 61 ] However, it worth noting that some studies have raised concerns about the potential immunosuppressive effects of MSCs, which may increase the risk of tumor development in patients. [ 62 , 63 ] This aspect is still under investigation, and further research is needed to fully understand the implications of MSC-based therapies in RA. 5. Conclusion The study on the association between DNA methylation and rheumatoid arthritis, conducted through bibliometric analysis and the exploration of international collaborations, authors, publications, keywords, and research hotspots, offers valuable insights to the medical community. It illuminates the evolving landscape of DNA methylation research in the context of rheumatoid arthritis and underscores the significance of epigenetics in the study of autoimmune diseases. As genetic technology continues to advance, research aimed at diagnosing and treating autoimmune diseases is expected to become more sophisticated. However, it essential to acknowledge that investigating the relationship between DNA methylation and rheumatoid arthritis faces various challenges. The clinical application of epigenetic drugs designed to regulate abnormal DNA methylation patterns in RA is still in its infancy. While the FDA has approved blood tests based on DNA methylation biomarker technology for colorectal cancer screening, [ 64 ] similar breakthroughs are eagerly anticipated in rheumatoid arthritis research. In the near future, the hope is to discover noninvasive DNA methylation biomarkers that can be readily employed in daily medical practice for the early detection of RA, potentially before irreversible joint damage occurs. This not only promises a deeper understanding of how the epigenetic landscape contributes to the pathogenesis of RA but also opens doors to leveraging DNA methylation mechanisms for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Such advancements could not only slow or mitigate disease progression but also lead to overall reductions in healthcare costs and a decrease in the societal and patient burden associated with rheumatoid arthritis. 5.1. Strengths and limitations This study presents the first-ever bibliometric analysis of rheumatoid arthritis and DNA methylation. By employing systematic search and quantitative statistical analysis, our research provides a comprehensive and visually informative overview of the literature in this field, going beyond the confines of a traditional literature review. However, our study is not without its limitations. While the Web of Science core collection database is extensive and encompasses a significant portion of scholarly articles, it may not include every pertinent publication on this topic. There could be research articles, reviews, or other forms of literature in alternative databases or sources that our analysis did not incorporate. Consequently, there is a chance that our study may have missed valuable contributions to this field. Future research in this area should prioritize expanding the scope of analysis, possibly by integrating additional databases or sources. This approach would ensure a more comprehensive overview of the subject matter, thereby augmenting the accuracy and completeness of bibliometric analyses in this field.

    "full_text_abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent autoimmune disorder with a significant global economic burden. Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, play a crucial role in RA. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis to explore the evolving trends and predominant themes in RA and DNA methylation research over the past two decades. A total of 1800 articles met the inclusion criteria, and the analysis revealed consistent growth in the literature, with a notable increase in output after 2019. The research involved 70 countries, 2139 academic institutions, 23,365 unique authors, and 58,636 co-cited authors. The United States emerged as a dominant contributor in this research domain. The significance of DNA methylation in shaping research directions for RA management is increasingly evident. Recent investigations have shed light on the pivotal role of DNA methylation in RA, particularly in characterizing synovial tissue and exploring the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. This study provides valuable insights into the landscape of DNA methylation research in RA and highlights the importance of epigenetics in autoimmune diseases."
