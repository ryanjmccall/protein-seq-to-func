  "abstract_text": "<h4>Aim</h4>To study the expression of p53 tumour suppressor gene in anaplastic carcinomas arising from thyroid papillary carcinomas.<h4>Methods</h4>Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissues from four cases of anaplastic carcinomas associated with thyroid papillary carcinomas were studied by immunohistochemistry with two different p53 monoclonal antibodies.<h4>Results</h4>The anaplastic component showed nuclear immunostaining in two cases, but not in the other two. In all cases the papillary carcinoma component was negative.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results support the hypothesis that p53 stimulates tumour progression in thyroid tumours.",
