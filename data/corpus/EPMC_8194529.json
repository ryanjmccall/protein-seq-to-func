  "abstract_text": "The human BTF2 (TFIIH) transcription factor is a multisubunit protein involved in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (B) as well as in DNA repair. In addition to the previously characterized p62 and p89/ERCC3 subunits, we have cloned two other subunits of BTF2, p44 and p34. The gene encoding p44 appeared to be the human counterpart of SSL1, a gene involved in translation and UV resistance in yeast. Interestingly, the p34 subunit also has homology with a domain of SSL1, suggesting that it corresponds to an as yet unidentified protein involved in DNA repair. Both p44 and p34 possess zinc finger domains that may mediate BTF2 binding to nucleic acids.",
