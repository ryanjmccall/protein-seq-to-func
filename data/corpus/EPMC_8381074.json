  "abstract_text": "The transcriptional transactivational activities of the phosphoprotein cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) are activated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A signaling pathway. Dimers of CREB bind to the palindromic DNA element 5'-TGACGTCA-3' (or similar motifs) called cAMP-responsive enhancers (CREs) found in the control regions of many genes, and activate transcription in response to phosphorylation of CREB by protein kinase A. Earlier we reported on the cyclical expression of the CREB gene in the Sertoli cells of the rat testis that occurred concomitant with the FSH-induced rise in cellular cAMP levels and suggested that transcription of the CREB gene may be autoregulated by cAMP-dependent transcriptional proteins. We now report the structure of the 5'-flanking sequence of the human CREB gene containing promoter activity. The promoter has a high content of guanosines and cytosines and lacks canonical TATA and CCAAT boxes typically found in the promoters of genes in eukaryotes. Notably, the promoter contains three CREs and transcriptional activities of a promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid transfected to placental JEG-3 cells are increased 3- to 5-fold over basal activities in response to either cAMP or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-14-acetate, and give 6- to 7-fold responses when both agents are added. The CREs bind recombinant CREB and endogenous CREB or CREB-like proteins contained in placental JEG-3 cells and also confer cAMP-inducible transcriptional activation to a heterologous minimal promoter. Our studies suggest that the expression of the CREB gene is positively autoregulated in trans.",
