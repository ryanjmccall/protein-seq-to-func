  "abstract_text": "We have analysed Li-Fraumeni syndrome families, previously shown to be negative for mutations in TP53, for mutations to the tumour suppressor genes PTEN and CDKN2. These genes function in cell cycle progression or are mutated in a variety of tumours. We have detected no mutations in the family members tested.",
