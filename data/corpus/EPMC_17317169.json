  "abstract_text": "The discovery and synthesis of 3-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridin-2(1H)-one inhibitors of insulin-like growth factor 1-receptor (IGF-1R) are presented. Installing amine containing side chains at the 4-position of pyridone ring significantly improved the enzyme potency. SAR and biological activity of these compounds is presented.",
