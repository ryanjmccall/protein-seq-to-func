    "abstract_text": "A cDNA clone for human p53 cellular tumor antigen has been isolated and characterized. This clone contains the complete 3'-untranslated region and most of the open reading frame for the protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that p53 mRNA contains an Alu repeat in the 3'-untranslated region. Hybridization selection experiments showed this clone was capable of selectively binding p53 mRNA. In vitro translation of SV80 mRNA resulted in the synthesis of two immunoreactive p53 polypeptide species. Northern blot analysis showed that human p53 mRNA was 2.8 kb in length and was present in cell lines containing high and low levels of p53 protein. There appears to be only a single p53 gene in human cells and Southern blot analysis demonstrated no major genomic rearrangements or amplification of the p53 gene in the transformed cell lines examined.",
