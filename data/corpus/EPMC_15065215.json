    "abstract_text": "In this 11th article in a series, reference values of serum levels alpha(2)-macroglobulin alpha(2)M) are examined. The study is based on a cohort of 40,420 Caucasian individuals from northern New England that were tested in our laboratory between 1994 and 2000. Measurements were standardized against Certified Reference Material (CRM 470)/Reference Preparation for Proteins in Human Serum (RPPHS) and the results analyzed using a previously described statistical approach. Individuals with unequivocal laboratory evidence of inflammation (C-reactive protein >10 mg/L) were excluded in one leg of the study and included in the other, confirming that alpha(2)M does not respond to acute phase drive in man. Nephrotic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and chronic liver disease have significant effect on levels of alpha(2)M. Dramatic changes occur during life with males higher from birth to age 12, females thereafter have higher values until the ninth decade. When values were expressed as multiples of the age- and gender-specific median levels, the resulting distributions fitted a log-Gaussian distribution well over a broad range. When patient data are normalized in this manner, the distribution parameters can be used to assign a centile corresponding to an individual's measurement thus simplifying interpretation.",
