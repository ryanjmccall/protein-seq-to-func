  "title": "Manganese superoxide dismutase: nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of a cDNA encoding a new human transcript.",
  "year": 1990,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/1699607",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "Three human cDNA libraries were screened with a human manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) cDNA under moderately stringent conditions to characterize a large 4-6 kb RNA species which hybridizes to Mn-SOD in RNA blot analyses. A new 4.2 kb Mn-SOD cDNA clone (Mn-SOD 1) was isolated. Its long 3426 nucleotide 3'-untranslated sequence contains both of the 240 base 3'-untranslated sequences of the 1 kb Mn-SOD 4 and 5 cDNAs. This is a fully processed, cytoplasmic RNA species and raises the possibility of a role for particular 3'-untranslated sequence selection in Mn-SOD gene regulation.",
