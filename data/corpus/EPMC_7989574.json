    "abstract_text": "Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is induced in ischemic hearts 24 h after ischemic preconditioning, when tolerance to ischemia is acquired. We examined the relationship between Mn-SOD induction and the protective effect of preconditioning using cultured rat cardiac myocytes. Exposure of cardiac myocytes to brief hypoxia (1 h) decreased creatine kinase release induced by sustained hypoxia (3 h) that follows when the sustained hypoxia was applied 24 h after hypoxic preconditioning (57% of that in cells without preconditioning). The activity and content of Mn-SOD in cardiac myocytes were increased 24 h after hypoxic preconditioning (activity, 170%; content, 139% compared with cells without preconditioning) coincidentally with the acquisition of tolerance to hypoxia. Mn-SOD mRNA was also increased 20-40 min after preconditioning. Antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides corresponding to the initiation site of Mn-SOD translation inhibited the increases in the Mn-SOD content and activity and abolished the expected decrease in creatine kinase release induced by sustained hypoxia after 24 h of hypoxic preconditioning. Sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides did not abolish either Mn-SOD induction or tolerance to hypoxia. These results suggest that the induction of Mn-SOD in myocytes by preconditioning plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of tolerance to ischemia at a later phase (24 h) of ischemic preconditioning.",
