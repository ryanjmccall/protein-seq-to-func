    "abstract_text": "We have recently succeeded in producing transgenic mice carrying a hybrid gene consisting of mouse metallothionein promoter-enhancer and the ret oncogene (MT/ret). (Iwamoto et al., 1991b). A retroperitoneal tumour developed in one of 17 MT/ret transgenic founder mice. Histological analysis revealed that the tumour consisted of undifferentiated neuroblasts and differentiated ganglion cells, the latter of which were strongly positive for neuron specific enolase. Expression of the ret transgene was observed at high levels in RNA from the tumour, but not in those of other normal tissues. In addition, a 100kDa ret protein was detected in the cell lysate of the tumour. Taken together with our previous data, these results suggest a possible role for the ret oncogene in the proliferation of neural crest cells.",
