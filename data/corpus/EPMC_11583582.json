  "abstract_text": "The Myc/Max/Mad transcription factor network plays a central role in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In order to elucidate the biological function of Mad3, we have analysed the precise temporal patterns of Mad3 mRNA expression during the cell cycle and differentiation in cultured cells. We show that Mad3 is induced at the G1/S transition in proliferating cells; expression persists throughout S-phase, and then declines as cells pass through G2 and mitosis. The expression pattern of Mad3 is coincident with that of Cdc2 throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, the expression of Mad3 during differentiation of cultured mouse erythroleukemia cells shows two transient peaks of induction. The first of these occurs at the onset of differentiation, and does not correlate with the S-phase of the cell cycle, whereas the second is coincident with the S-phase burst that precedes the terminal stages of differentiation. Our results therefore suggest that Mad3 serves a cell-cycle-related function in both proliferating and differentiating cells, and that it may also have a distinct role at various stages of differentiation.",
