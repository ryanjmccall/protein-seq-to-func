    "abstract_text": "DNA end resection initiates DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 and phosphorylated CtIP perform the first resection step <i>via</i> MRE11-catalyzed endonucleolytic DNA cleavage. Human NBS1, more than its homologue Xrs2 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is crucial for this process, highlighting complex mechanisms that regulate the MRE11 nuclease in higher eukaryotes. Using a reconstituted system, we show here that NBS1, through its FHA and BRCT domains, functions as a sensor of CtIP phosphorylation. NBS1 then activates the MRE11-RAD50 nuclease through direct physical interactions with MRE11. In the absence of NBS1, MRE11-RAD50 exhibits a weaker nuclease activity, which requires CtIP but not strictly its phosphorylation. This identifies at least two mechanisms by which CtIP augments MRE11: a phosphorylation-dependent mode through NBS1 and a phosphorylation-independent mode without NBS1. In support, we show that limited DNA end resection occurs <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> in the absence of the FHA and BRCT domains of NBS1. Collectively, our data suggest that NBS1 restricts the MRE11-RAD50 nuclease to S-G2 phase when CtIP is extensively phosphorylated. This defines mechanisms that regulate the MRE11 nuclease in DNA metabolism.",
