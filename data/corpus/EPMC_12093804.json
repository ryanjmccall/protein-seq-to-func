  "title": "Suppression of estrogen receptor-mediated transcription and cell growth by interaction with TR2 orphan receptor.",
  "year": 2002,

  "abstract_text": "The transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor (ER) is known to be highly modulated by the character and amount of coregulator proteins present in the cells. TR2 orphan receptor (TR2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily without identified ligands, is found to be expressed in the breast cancer cell lines and to function as a repressor to suppress ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Utilizing an interaction blocker, ER-6 (amino acids 312-340), responsible for TR2 interaction, the suppression of ER by TR2 could be reversed, suggesting that this suppression is conferred by the direct protein-protein interaction. Administration of antisense TR2, resulting in an enhancement of ER transcriptional activity in MCF7 cells, indicates that endogenous TR2 normally suppresses ER-mediated signaling. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism by which TR2 suppresses ER, we found that TR2 could interrupt ER DNA binding via formation of an ER-TR2 heterodimer that disrupted the ER homodimerization. The suppression of ER transcription by TR2 consequently caused the inhibition of estrogen-induced cell growth and G(1)/S transition in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. Taken together in addition to the potential roles in spermatogenesis and neurogenesis, our data provide a novel biological function of TR2 that may exert an important repressor in regulating ER activity in mammary glands.",
