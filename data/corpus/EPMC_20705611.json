    "abstract_text": "Constitutive activation of NF\u03baB in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is associated with tumor recurrence and development of anti-estrogen resistance. Furthermore, a gene expression signature containing common targets for ER and NF\u03baB has been identified and found to be associated with the more aggressive luminal B intrinsic subtype of ER-positive breast tumors. Here, we describe a novel mechanism by which ER and NF\u03baB cooperate to up-regulate expression of one important gene from this signature, ABCG2, which encodes a transporter protein associated with the development of drug-resistant breast cancer. We and others have confirmed that this gene is regulated primarily by estrogen in an ER- and estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent manner. We found that whereas proinflammatory cytokines have little effect on this gene in the absence of 17\u03b2-estradiol, they can potentiate ER activity in an NF\u03baB-dependent manner. ER allows the NF\u03baB family member p65 to access a latent NF\u03baB response element located near the ERE in the gene promoter. NF\u03baB recruitment to the gene is, in turn, required to stabilize ER occupancy at the functional ERE. The result of this cooperative binding of ER and p65 at adjacent response elements leads to a major increase in both ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression. These findings indicate that estrogen and inflammatory factors can modify each other's activity through modulation of transcription factor accessibility and/or occupancy at adjacent response elements. This novel transcriptional mechanism could have important implications in breast cancer, where both inflammation and estrogen can promote cancer progression.",
