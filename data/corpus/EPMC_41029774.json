Keywords PML::RARA and RARA::PML transcripts Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) Arsenic trioxide (ATO) therapy issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Background A reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.2), results in the PML::RARA and RARA::PML fusions, a hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [ 1 ]. Over 90% of APL cases exhibit this typical translocation, characterized by dual fusions: PML::RARA on the derivative chromosome 15 [der(15)t(15;17)] and RARA::PML on the derivative chromosome 17 [der(17)t(15;17)] [ 2 , 3 ]. The PML::RARA fusion on der(15) is critical for leukemogenesis, and the resulting PML-RARA fusion protein is the primary target of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy [ 3 ]. However, studies using transgenic mice suggest that the reciprocal RARA::PML transcript may also contribute to APL leukemogenesis [ 4 ], although in vitro studies indicate that RARA::PML alone does not confer sensitivity to ATRA therapy [ 5 ]. Occasionally, atypical t(15;17) translocations, including complex rearrangements or submicroscopic insertions, have been reported in APL. Some cases involve insertions of RARA from chromosome 17 into PML on der(15), leading to PML::RARA expression without the reciprocal RARA::PML [ 6 ]. More rarely, submicroscopic insertions of PML from chromosome 15 into RARA on der(17) occur, resulting in the expression of either PML::RARA or RARA::PML [ 7 ]. The role of RARA::PML in APL tumorigenesis remains debated, and studying cases with single fusions of PML::RARA or RARA::PML on der(15) or der(17), along with their therapeutic responses, may help clarify its significance. Here, we present a patient with an unusual APL case featuring a normal karyotype, an atypical single fusion of PML::RARA on der(17), and a favorable response to ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO) therapy. Case presentation Our patient is a 44-year-old female who presented with pancytopenia (WBC 1.11 × 10³/µL, Hb 10 g/dL, PLT 30 × 10³/µL) and coagulopathy, including prolonged PT/PTT and low fibrinogen (98 mg/dL). Peripheral blood smear revealed circulating blasts with classic promyelocytic morphology characterized by “sliding plate” nuclei and numerous cytoplasmic granules (Fig. 1 A). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellularity for her age on low-power examination (Fig. 1 B). Higher-power views demonstrated marrow expansion by left-shifted myeloid cells, including abundant granular promyelocytes (Fig. 1 C). Although limited by smear thickness, the aspirate smears contained numerous abnormal promyelocytes with scattered Auer rods (Fig. 1 D). Flow cytometry identified a neoplastic population within the blast gate, exhibiting slightly increased side scatter consistent with cytoplasmic granularity. This population was positive for CD117, CD13, CD33, and MPO, and negative for CD34 and HLA-DR, a typical immunophenotype of APL blasts. Given the clinical suspicion of APL, the patient was started empirically on all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was conducted on the diagnostic bone marrow aspirate using the Vysis LSI PML/RARA dual-color, dual-fusion probe set and Vysis IntelliFish hybridization buffer (Abbott Molecular Diagnostics, Illinois, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 200 cells were analyzed. An atypical single fusion of PML::RARA or RARA::PML , instead of the typical dual fusions, was observed in 71.5% of the cells, with the result nuc ish(PMLx3, RARAx2)(PML con RARAx1)[143/200] (Fig. 1 E). To further investigate the single fusion, karyotype and metaphase FISH analyses were performed on the diagnostic cultured bone marrow cells, alongside a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. A normal female karyotype was identified from the analysis of 20 cells. Metaphase FISH, conducted at NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc. (Fort Myers, FL, USA), confirmed that the single fusion signal was located on der(17) (Fig. 1 F). Normal hybridization signals were detected on one normal chromosome 17 ( RARA ) and one normal chromosome 15 ( PML ), with a reduced PML signal on the other chromosome 15 [der(15)]. This suggests that a portion of the PML gene from der(15) was inserted into der(17), forming the single fusion signal, Fig. 1 Morphologic and Molecular Findings A - G .

One smaller PML signal was observed in both interphase and metaphase cells, indicating that part of PML from der(15) inserted into RARA on der(17) to form the single fusion of PML::RARA or RARA::PML . (G) RT-qPCR amplification plot displaying the expression levels of ABL1 (Ct = 22.8, yellow), used as an internal control, and PML::RARA L (long isoform, Ct = 27.6, green) across cycles, confirming that the single fusion corresponds to the PML::RARA long isoform transcript. The PML::RARA S (short isoform, green) acts as a background, as primers designed for the long isoform also amplify the internal region of the transcript (short isoform); however, in the presence of a true short isoform, no long isoform amplification is observed. ish ins(17;15)(q21.2;q24.1q24.1)(PML+,RARA+;PML+). RT-qPCR assays were performed on this patient’s diagnostic and follow-up bone marrow samples at NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc. (Fort Myers, FL, USA) to detect the two PML::RARA fusion isoforms (long and short). Isoform identification was based on characteristic amplification patterns, and relative expression levels were calculated using the formula: PML::RARA pg/( PML::RARA pg + ABL1 pg) × 100 [ 8 ]. RT-qPCR analysis of the diagnostic sample detected the bcr1 (long) isoform of the PML::RARA fusion transcript (Fig. 1 G), consisting of exons 1–6 of PML fused to exons 3–9 of RARA [ 4 , 9 ]. The PML::RARA transcript ratio, relative to the combined total of PML::RARA and ABL1 , was 3.817%. Integrated FISH and RT-qPCR analyses confirmed that the single fusion on der(17) was PML::RARA . The patient was treated with the standard ATRA and ATO combination regimen for APL. At the end of induction, bone marrow evaluation showed morphological remission. Both FISH and molecular RT-qPCR analyses were negative for the PML::RARA transcript, indicating that the patient achieved complete cytogenetic and molecular remission. Discussion and conclusions Prompt diagnosis of APL and the timely initiation of effective therapy with ATRA and ATO are crucial for achieving favorable patient outcomes. Cryptic aberrations resulting in single fusions of either PML::RARA or RARA::PML are rare [ 9 ], and data on therapy response and prognosis in such cases remain limited [ 10 , 11 ]. A literature review revealed only eight reported APL cases involving cryptic insertions of PML from chromosome 15 into RARA on der(17), resulting in the formation of the PML::RARA transcript in five confirmed cases and the RARA::PML transcript in one case (Table 1 ). Among the five patients with the PML::RARA transcript, treatment data were available for three, all of whom responded well to ATRA therapy (Table 1 ). In contrast, the single patient with the RARA::PML transcript exhibited resistance to ATRA therapy (Table 1 ). To our knowledge, our patient represents the fourth reported case of a single PML::RARA fusion on der(17) without the reciprocal RARA::PML fusion, and she demonstrated a favorable response to combined ATRA and ATO therapy. Table 1: Summary of APL cases with single fusion of PML::RARA or RARA::PML on der (17) No. of cases PML::RARA RARA::PML Techniques used Response to ATRA or ATRA/ATO therapies References 1 Absent Present FISH, Southern blot & Western blot hybridizations No [ 5 , 7 , 9 ] 1 NR NR FISH Yes [ 7 ] 1 Present Absent FISH, RT-PCR Yes, relapsed [ 7 ] 1 Present Absent FISH, RT-PCR Yes [ 12 ] 3 Present Absent FISH, RT-PCR NR [ 4 ] 1 Present Absent FISH, RT-PCR Yes [ 13 ] 1 Present Absent FISH, RT-PCR Yes Our case NR: Not reported Studies using transgenic mouse models and human APL cell lines have demonstrated that the PML::RARA transcript plays a central role in APL pathogenesis and is responsive to ATRA/ATO therapies. In contrast, the role of the RARA::PML transcript remains unclear and appears to be resistant to ATRA, based on findings from a single reported case [ 5 , 9 ]. Therefore, investigating additional cases with isolated PML::RARA or RARA::PML fusions would enhance our understanding of the individual contributions of these transcripts to APL pathogenesis and treatment response. As well, the insertion of PML from chromosome 15 into RARA on der(17) can generate either fusion transcript, PML::RARA or RARA::PML , precise molecular identification is essential for informing clinical management and prognostic assessment. While some studies have suggested that the RARA::PML transcript or co-occurring mutations in genes such as FLT3 , NRAS , KRAS , WT1 , IDH1/2 , and DNMT3A may be necessary for APL leukemogenesis [ 4 , 14 ], our case demonstrates that the PML::RARA fusion alone—without RARA::PML —can drive the disease. However, as DNA sequencing was not performed, the presence of additional pathogenic gene mutations cannot be excluded. Future studies involving comprehensive genomic profiling of more APL cases with isolated PML::RARA or RARA::PML fusions are needed to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying APL leukemogenesis. Our patient demonstrates that a single PML::RARA fusion, resulting from a cryptic insertion of PML from chromosome 15 into RARA on chromosome 17—without the accompanying RARA::PML transcript—can drive leukemogenesis and respond to ATRA/ATO therapy similarly to the typical PML::RARA and RARA::PML transcripts formed through reciprocal translocation. This finding strongly supports the assertion that: PML::RARA is the primary transcript driving APL tumorigenesis, regardless of its location on der(15) or der(17), and responds effectively to ATRA/ATO therapy, the RARA::PML transcript may not be essential for APL tumorigenesis; further studies on cases with single RARA::PML fusions and experimental functional analyses of RARA::PML are needed, patients with suspected APL should undergo immediate testing via FISH, RT-PCR, or other molecular methods to identify the transcript type and guide treatment decisions, ATRA/ATO therapy should be initiated promptly upon suspicion of APL [ 15 ].
