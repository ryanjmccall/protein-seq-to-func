    "abstract_text": "Four hexapeptides of sequence L-Val-L-Tyr-L-Pro-(Asp)-Gly-L-Ala containing D- or L-aspartyl residues in normal or isopeptide linkages have been synthesized by the Merrifield solid-phase method as potential substrates of the erythrocyte protein carboxyl methyltransferase. This enzyme has been shown to catalyze the methylation of D-aspartyl residues in proteins in red blood cell membranes and cytosol. Using a new vapor-phase methanol diffusion assay, we have found that the normal hexapeptides containing either D- or L-aspartyl residues were not substrates for the human erythrocyte methyltransferase. On the other hand, the L-aspartyl isopeptide, in which the glycyl residue was linked in a peptide bond to the beta-carboxyl group of the aspartyl residue, was a substrate for the enzyme with a Km of 6.3 microM and was methylated with a maximal velocity equal to that observed when ovalbumin was used as a methyl acceptor. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of up to 0.8 mol of methyl groups/mol of this peptide. Of the four synthetic peptides, only the L-isohexapeptide competitively inhibits the methylation of ovalbumin by the erythrocyte enzyme. This peptide also acts as a substrate for both of the purified protein carboxyl methyltransferases I and II which have been previously isolated from bovine brain (Aswad, D. W., and Deight, E. A. (1983) J. Neurochem. 40, 1718-1726). The L-isoaspartyl hexapeptide represents the first defined synthetic substrate for a eucaryotic protein carboxyl methyltransferase. These results demonstrate that these enzymes can not only catalyze the formation of methyl esters at the beta-carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl residues but can also form esters at the alpha-carboxyl groups of isomerized L-aspartyl residues. The implications of these findings for the metabolism of modified proteins are discussed.",
