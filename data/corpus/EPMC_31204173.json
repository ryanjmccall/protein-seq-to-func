    "abstract_text": "Serum starvation stimulates cilia growth in cultured cells, yet serum factors associated with ciliogenesis are unknown. Previously, we showed that starvation induces rapid Rab11-dependent vesicular trafficking of Rabin8, a Rab8 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), to the mother centriole, leading to Rab8 activation and cilium growth. Here, we demonstrate that through the LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1), serum lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) inhibits Rab11a-Rabin8 interaction and ciliogenesis. LPA/LPAR1 regulates ciliogenesis initiation via downstream PI3K/Akt activation, independent of effects on cell cycle. Akt stabilizes Rab11a binding to its effector, WDR44, and a WDR44-pAkt-phosphomimetic mutant blocks ciliogenesis. WDR44 depletion promotes Rabin8 preciliary trafficking and ciliogenesis-initiating events at the mother centriole. Our work suggests disruption of Akt signaling causes a switch from Rab11-WDR44 to the ciliogenic Rab11-FIP3-Rabin8 complex. Finally, we demonstrate that Akt regulates downstream ciliogenesis processes associated with Rab8-dependent cilia growth. Together, this study uncovers a mechanism whereby serum mitogen signaling regulates Rabin8 preciliary trafficking and ciliogenesis initiation.",
