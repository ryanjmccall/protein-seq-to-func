    "abstract_text": "Human brain S100b (beta beta) protein was purified using zinc-dependent affinity chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. The calcium- and zinc-binding properties of the protein were studied by flow dialysis technique and the protein conformation both in the metal-free form and in the presence of Ca2+ or Zn2+ was investigated with ultraviolet spectroscopy, sulfhydryl reactivity and interaction with a hydrophobic fluorescence probe 6-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid (TNS). Flow dialysis measurements of Ca2+ binding to human brain S100b (beta beta) protein revealed six Ca2+-binding sites which we assumed to represent three for each beta monomer, characterized by the macroscopic association constants K1 = 0.44 X 10(5) M-1; K2 = 0.1 X 10(5) M-1 and K3 = 0.08 X 10(5) M-1. In the presence of 120 mM KCl, the affinity of the protein for calcium is drastically reduced. Zinc-binding studies on human S100b protein showed that the protein bound two zinc ions per beta monomer, with macroscopic constants K1 = 4.47 X 10(7) M-1 and K2 = 0.1 X 10(7) M-1. Most of the Zn2+-induced conformational changes occurred after the binding of two zinc ions per mole of S100b protein. These results differ significantly from those for bovine protein and cast doubt on the conservation of the S100 structure during evolution. When calcium binding was studied in the presence of zinc, we noted an increase in the affinity of the protein for calcium, K1 = 4.4 X 10(5) M-1; K2 = 0.57 X 10(5) M-1; K3 = 0.023 X 10(5) M-1. These results indicated that the Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding sites on S100b protein are different and suggest that Zn2+ may regulate Ca2+ binding by increasing the affinity of the protein for calcium.",
