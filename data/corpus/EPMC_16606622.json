  "abstract_text": "Artemis, a member of the beta-CASP family, has been implicated in the regulation of both telomere stability and length. Prompted by this, we examined whether the other two putative DNA-binding members of this family, hSnm1A and hSnm1B, may associate with telomeres. hSnm1A was found to not interact with the telomere. Conversely, hSnm1B was found to associate with telomeres in vivo by both immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the C terminus of hSnm1B was shown to interact with the TRF homology domain of TRF2 indicating that hSnm1B is likely recruited to the telomere via interaction with the double-stranded telomere-binding protein TRF2.",
