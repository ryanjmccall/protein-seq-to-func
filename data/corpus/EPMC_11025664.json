    "abstract_text": "The PML gene of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) encodes a growth- and tumour-suppresor protein that is essential for several apoptotic signals. The mechanisms by which PML exerts its pro-apoptotic function are still unknown. Here we show that PML acts as a transcriptional co-activator with p53. PML physically interacts with p53 both in vitro and in vivo and co-localizes with p53 in the PML nuclear body (PML-NB). The co-activatory role of PML depends on its ability to localize in the PML-NB. p53-dependent, DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, transcriptional activation by p53, the DNA-binding ability of p53, and the induction of p53 target genes such as Bax and p21 upon gamma-irradiation are all impaired in PML-/- primary cells. These results define a new PML-dependent, p53-regulatory pathway for apoptosis and shed new light on the function of PML in tumour suppression.",
