  "abstract_text": "Germline mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene often result in a significant increase in susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers. Although the molecular basis of their effects remains largely obscure, many mutations are known to target the highly conserved C-terminal BRCT repeats that function as a phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding module. We report the X-ray crystal structure at a resolution of 1.85 A of the BRCA1 tandem BRCT domains in complex with a phosphorylated peptide representing the minimal interacting region of the DEAH-box helicase BACH1. The structure reveals the determinants of this novel class of BRCA1 binding events. We show that a subset of disease-linked mutations act through specific disruption of phospho-dependent BRCA1 interactions rather than through gross structural perturbation of the tandem BRCT domains.",
