  "abstract_text": "Glioma tumour growth is associated with the expression of insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGFs) and of both type I and type II IGF receptors. It has also been shown that IGFs can stimulate proliferation of cultured glioma cells. We previously reported that histamine too can stimulate the growth of glioma cells in vitro. In this report, we study whether the histamine-induced growth of G47 glioma cells is mediated by the IGFs. We found that histamine stimulates the expression of both IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs, as determined by a semiquantitative in situ hybridization analysis. Furthermore, incubation of G47 cells with histamine also induced cellular immunostaining for IGF-II. It could be shown that IGF-I-stimulated proliferation is inhibited by IGFBP-3, which decreases the availability of IGFs for binding to the IGF receptors, and by beta-galactosidase, which may decrease IGF binding to the type II IGF receptor, but is not inhibited by the anti-type I IGF receptor monoclonal antibody alphaIR3. However, neither IGFBP-3 nor beta-galactosidase nor alphaIR3 inhibited the histamine-induced proliferation. These results show that the growth-stimulatory effect of histamine is accompanied by the induction of IGFs. This histamine-induced growth stimulation is not mediated by activation of cell surface IGF receptors, although intracrine activation of type II IGF receptors may be involved.",
