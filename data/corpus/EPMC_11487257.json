  "abstract_text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as an important factor for tumour angiogenesis, which is essential for the growth, invasion and metastasis of solid tumours. Significantly increased VEGF level from the primary tumour to the metastatic lesion of ovarian cancers was found in 8 of 30 cases. The 24-month survival rate of the patients with significantly increased VEGF level was extremely poor (0/8 = 0%) in comparison with that of patients with no change in the level (15/22 = 68%) from the primary tumour to the metastatic lesion. This indicates that VEGF may contribute to the advancement of metastatic lesions, and that VEGF level in metastatic lesions may be a prognostic indicator.",
