  "abstract_text": "Partial sequence analysis of the genomic eph locus revealed that the splicing points of kinase domain-encoding exons were completely distinct from those of the other protein tyrosine kinase members reported, suggesting that this is the earliest evolutionary split within this family. In Northern (RNA) blot analysis, the eph gene was expressed in liver, lung, kidney, and testis of rat, and screening of 25 human cancers of various cell types showed preferential expression in cells of epithelial origin. Overexpression of eph mRNA was found in a hepatoma and a lung cancer without gene amplification. Comparison of cDNA sequences derived from a normal liver and a hepatoma that overproduces eph mRNA demonstrated that two of them were completely identical throughout the transmembrane to the carboxy-terminal portions. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from human-mouse hybrid clones with an eph probe showed that this gene was present on human chromosome 7.",
