We previously reported that phosphorylation of topoisomerase (topo) II\u03b1 at serine-1106 (Ser-1106) regulates enzyme activity and sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs. In this study we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-1106, which is flanked by acidic amino acids, is regulated in vivo by casein kinase (CK) I\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b, but not by CKII. The CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, reduced Ser-1106 phosphorylation and decreased formation of etoposide-stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex. In contrast, the CKII inhibitor, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, did not affect etoposide-stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex formation. Since, IC261 specifically targets the Ca 2+ -regulated isozymes, CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b, we examined the effect of down-regulating these enzymes on Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Down-regulation of these isozymes with targeted si-RNAs led to hypophosphorylation of the Ser-1106 containing peptide. However, si-RNA-mediated down-regulation of CKII\u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 did not alter Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Furthermore, reduced phosphorylation of Ser-1106, observed in HRR25 (CKI\u03b4/\u025b homologous gene)-deleted Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with human topo II\u03b1, was enhanced following expression of human CKI\u025b. Down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b also led to reduced formation of etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex. These results provide strong support for an essential role of CKI\u03b4/\u025b in phosphorylating Ser-1106 in human topo II\u03b1 and in regulating enzyme function. INTRODUCTION Type II DNA topoisomerases, topoisomerase II (topo II) \u03b1 and \u03b2, regulate DNA topology by creating transient double stranded DNA breaks ( 1\u20133 ). Although, both enzymes exhibit significant sequence homology and catalyze redundant catalytic reactions, they are involved in different cellular functions. This difference may in part be due to differential regulation of these enzymes. Several different mechanisms have been shown to regulate topo II activity, including transcriptional, translational, as well as post-translational mechanisms. The major post-translational mechanisms that modulate topo II activity are phosphorylation, interaction with other proteins and proteasome-mediated degradation ( 1\u20133 ). Both topo II\u03b1 and topo II\u03b2 are phosphorylated at several sites, primarily in the divergent C-terminal region ( 4\u20138 ). Whereas, little is known about site-specific phosphorylation of topo II\u03b2, several in vitro and in vivo studies have identified specific phosphorylation sites in topo II\u03b1. Within the C-terminal region of topo II\u03b1 phosphorylation of threonine-1342, serine(Ser)-1376, Ser-1469 and Ser-1524 catalyzed by casein kinase (CK) II ( 6 , 9\u201314 ), and of Ser-1212, Ser-1246, Ser-1353, Ser-1360 and Ser-1392 catalyzed by a proline directed kinase has been observed ( 15 ). Recently, it has been reported that Polo-like kinase 1 phosphorylates topo II\u03b1 at Ser-1337 and Ser-1524 ( 16 ). In addition to the sites in the C-terminal region, phosphorylation of Ser-29 located in the ATP binding domain within the N-terminal region ( 17 ) and of Ser-1106 located within the catalytic core have also been reported ( 18 ). Whereas phosphorylation of Ser-29 is catalyzed by protein kinase C ( 17 ), the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser-1106 has not yet been identified. Since Ser-1106 is located in the catalytic domain of topo II\u03b1 and phosphorylation of this site enhances enzyme activity and sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs in vivo ( 18 ), it is important to decipher the mechanism by which phosphorylation of Ser-1106 is regulated. The first step toward determining this mechanism would be to identify the kinase(s) that catalyzes phosphorylation at this site. Based on the acidic amino acid sequences that flank Ser-1106 at the amino- and carboxy-terminus, two potential kinases that could phosphorylate this site are CKI and CKII ( 19 ). Although CKII has been recognized as a major kinase phosphorylating topo II\u03b1, the role of CKI in phosphorylating topo II\u03b1 has not been explored. Unlike CKII, which consists of a tetramer of two catalytic subunits, \u03b1 and/or \u03b1\u2032, and two regulatory \u03b2 subunits ( 20\u201322 ), human CKI comprises of a superfamily of seven different isozymes that function as monomers ( 23 , 24 ). Structurally these isozymes, CKI\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b31, \u03b32, \u03b33, \u03b4 and \u025b, are organized into three distinct regions \u2013 a short N-terminal region, a highly conserved kinase domain and a highly variable C-terminal domain, primarily involved in regulating enzyme function. The CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b isozymes are very similar in structure and exhibit 98% homology in the kinase domain and 50% homology in the C-terminal domain. Autophosphorylation of the C-terminal domain leads to inhibition of the enzyme, which can be relieved following dephosphorylation or proteolytic cleavage of this region, often via a Ca 2+ -dependent mechanism ( 25 , 26 ). Indeed, it has been suggested that dephosphorylation of CKI\u025b by the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, enhances phosphorylation of DARP-32 by this isozyme ( 27 , 28 ). Our earlier studies demonstrating a Ca 2+ -dependent mechanism in regulating phosphorylation of Ser-1106 and in modulating sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs ( 18 ) suggested that the kinase responsible for phosphorylating this site may be CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b, rather than CKII. In this study we examined the role of CKI\u03b4/\u025b and CKII in phosphorylating Ser-1106 by attenuating the activity of these kinases with specific inhibitors or with targeted si-RNAs. Our results demonstrated that CKI\u03b4/\u025b, but not CKII, catalyzes the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser-1106 and regulates topo II\u2013DNA cleavage activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents CKI-7 was obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo. IC261 was kindly provided by ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) was purchased from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA. Etoposide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA. Stock solutions of these compounds were made in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at \u221220 \u00b0 C. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to topo II\u03b1 was a gift from Dr Ian Hickson, ICRF, Oxford, UK. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b were obtained from ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA (generous gift from Dr Anthony DiMaggio) and BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA respectively. Goat polyclonal antibodies to CKII\u03b1 and CKII\u03b1\u2032 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA. Cell culture HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine at 37 \u00b0 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 95% air. HCT-116 cells, obtained from Dr Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine at 37 \u00b0 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 95% air. Cells were treated with CKI-7 (200 \u03bcM), IC261 (10 \u03bcM) or DRB (40 \u03bcM) for 3 h. When the combination of CKI or CKII inhibitor and etoposide was employed, cells were pretreated with CKI-7, IC261 or DRB for 3 h. Following this treatment, cells were washed, resuspended in inhibitor-free medium and incubated for an additional hour in etoposide. Transfection with targeted si-RNAs A 21-nucleotide duplex si-RNA (si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b) with the sequence sense: 5\u2032-CUGGGGAAGAAGGGCAACCdTdT-3\u2032 and antisense: 5\u2032-GGUUGCCCUUCUUCCCCAGdTdT-3\u2032, purchased from Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA was used to target identical regions in CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b ( 29 ). In addition the On-Target plus SMART pool si-RNA anti-CSNKID human (si-CKI\u03b4) and On-Target plus SMART pool si-RNA anti-CSNKIE human (si-CKI\u025b) were purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO. For targeting CKII\u03b1 RNA the siGENOM SMART pool CSNK2A1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was employed. The CKII\u03b1\u2032 si-RNA (sense: 5\u2032-CAGUCUGAGGAGCCGCGAGdTdT-3\u2032, antisense: 5\u2032-CGGCUCCUCAGACUGdTdT-3\u2032), previously described ( 30 ) was synthesized by MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany. The control si-RNA (5\u2032-GCUCAGAUCAAUACGGAGAdT dT-3\u2032) was purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO. HCT-116 cells were incubated in serum-free McCoy's medium for 6\u201310 h with the si-RNA (100 nM) in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. When the combination of si-CKI\u03b4 and si-CKI\u025b was employed, the concentration of each si-RNA was reduced to 75 nM. Following the initial incubation, cells were washed and cultured in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM l -glutamine for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were harvested for preparing cell lysates. When cells were transfected with si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b about 50\u201370% of the cells that readily detached upon washing were used for preparing lysates for 2D-phosphopeptide maps of topo II\u03b1, since both CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b were maximally down-regulated in this population. Transformation of Sachharomyces cerevisiae W303 cells The wild-type (WT) S. cerevisiae W303 strain ( ura3-1 , trp1-1 , leu 2-3 , 112 , his3-11 , 15 can1-100 , ade2-1 ) and 7D, an HRR25\u0394 isolate isogenic to W303 ( 31 ) kindly provided by Dr Anthony DeMaggio (ICOS, Corp., Bothell, WA) were transformed with human topo II\u03b1 cDNA cloned in the pHT212 vector using the Yeastmaker lithium acetate transformation system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Control transformations were carried out with the pHT212 plasmid ( LEU2 ). Cells transformed with the pHT212 plasmid or pHT212 plasmid with the human topo II\u03b1 insert were selected on plates lacking leucine ( 18 ). The HRR25\u0394 isolate expressing human topo II\u03b1 was transfomed with the human CKI\u025b cDNA, (kindly provided by Dr Jeff Kuret, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH), which was inserted in MluI and XbaI restriction sites of the modified pRS316 plasmid, YEpRS316. The YEpRS316 plasmid was constructed by insertion of the ScaI fragment from pYEpWOB6 which contains the 2 \u03bcm origin. Control transformations were carried out with the YEpRS316 plasmid ( LEU2 and URA3 ). The transformed cells were selected on plates lacking leucine and uracil. Metabolic labeling with [ 32 P] orthophosphoric acid Log phase cultures of HL-60 or HCT-116 cells were incubated in phosphate-free RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine for 1 h at 37 \u00b0 C. Cells were then labeled with carrier-free [ 32 P] orthophosphoric acid (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for an additional 3 h. During the labeling period, the CKI or CKII inhibitor was added for experiments involving these treatments. Yeast cells were labeled as previously described ( 18 ). Briefly, cells cultured overnight at 30\u00b0C with shaking (250 rpm) in synthetic dropout liquid medium lacking leucine were incubated in YPDA without phosphate medium, for 3 h with shaking, to a cell density corresponding to 0.6 units ( A 600). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended into 20 ml of YPDA medium without phosphate containing 5 mCi of [ 32 P]-orthophosphoric acid and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h with shaking. Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation and western blotting Lysates of HL-60 and HCT-116 cells were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as described earlier ( 18 ). Topo II\u03b1 protein immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate was subjected to SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane ( 18 ). The membrane was stained with Gelcode Blue staining reagent (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) to visualize the topo II\u03b1 band, which was excised and processed for proteolysis with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) or trypsin ( 18 ). For determination of down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b, western blot analysis was carried out on cell lysates (20\u201340 \u03bcg) prepared from si-RNA transfected cells that were harvested just prior to labeling with [ 32 P]-orthophosphoric acid ( 32 ). Cell lysate of S. cerevisiae cells were prepared in Y-PER lysis buffer after freezing the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen and human topo II\u03b1 present in the lysate was purified by Ni 2+ -nitrilotriacetic acid essentially as described earlier ( 18 ). Purified topo II\u03b1 was subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and the stained topo II\u03b1 band was processed for phosphopetide mapping. Phosphopeptide mapping of 32 P-labeled topo II\u03b1 The 170 kDa 32 P-labeled topo II\u03b1 band visualized by staining with Gelcode Blue staining reagent on the nitrocellulose membrane was excised and digested with trypsin essentially as described earlier ( 18 ). Following extensive washing of the membrane in water, topo II\u03b1 was proteolytically cleaved with 5 \u03bcg of trypsin-TPCK treated (Worthington Biochemical, Freehold, NJ) or with 2 \u03bcg of trypsin Gold\u00ae (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) in 1% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3 at 37 \u00b0 C for 14\u201316 h. In initial experiments involving treatment with CKI inhibitors, proteolytic digestion with TPCK-treated trypsin consistently led to generation of two Ser-1106 containing peptides due to partial proteolysis ( Figure 1 B), whereas in subsequent experiments trypsinization with highly purified trypsin Gold\u00ae consistently led to generation of a single Ser-1106 containing peptide. The tryptic peptides released in the ammonium bicarbonate solution were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tube and the membrane piece was washed with 100 \u03bcl of 20% acetonitrile. The pooled eluate and washings were then concentrated by evaporation in a Savant Speed-Vac, washed three times with water and the peptides solubilized in pH 1.9 buffer (88% formic acid/glacial acetic acid/deionized water, 1:3.1:36, v/v). The peptides were then separated on thin layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis with pH 1.9 buffer in the horizontal dimension and chromatography in the vertical dimension ( 33 ). In initial experiments the phospho-chromatography buffer contained n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water (5/3.3/1/4, v/v). To improve migration of the Ser-1106-peptide an isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/ n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water) (32.9/1/2.5/1.5/14.7, v/v), which resolves extremely hydrophilic phosphopeptides, was used. Figure 1. CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, decrease phosphorylation of the topo II\u03b1 peptides containing Ser-1106. HL-60 cells were labeled with [ 32 P] orthophosphoric acid for 3 h at 37 \u00b0 C in the absence or presence of CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 (200 \u03bcM) or IC261 (10 \u03bcM). Lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated with topo II\u03b1-specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitated protein was subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Two-thirds of the topo II\u03b1 band was cleaved with CNBr and one-third of the band was proteolysed with trypsin. ( A ) CNBr fragments of topo II\u03b1 from cells treated in the absence or presence of CKI-7 or IC261 were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE. ( B ) Phosphopeptide maps of tryptic digests of topo II\u03b1 from cells treated in the absence (Control) or presence of CKI-7 or IC261. The phosphochromatography buffer, n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water (5/3.3/1/4, v/v), was used for resolving peptides in the second dimension. Arrows indicate the position of Ser-1106 containing peptides. Liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) LC\u2013MS was carried out on tryptic digests of stained topo II\u03b1 protein band excised from SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels. In-gel trypsin digestion was carried out as described earlier ( 34 ). Briefly, following washing/destaining in two aliquots of 50% ethanol/5% acetic acid (v/v), reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide, the excised gel pieces were dried in a Speed-vac and incubated with 30 \u03bcl of 20 ng/\u03bcl trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate on ice for 10 min. Any excess trypsin solution was then removed and 20 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added. Following overnight digestion at room temperature, the peptides were extracted from polyacrylamide pieces in two 30 \u03bcl aliquots of 50% acetonitrile/5% formic acid (v/v). These extracts were combined and evaporated to \u223c5 \u03bcl and then reconstituted in 1% acetic acid to a total volume of 25 \u03bcl for LC\u2013MS analysis. The tryptic peptides in the extract (2 \u03bcl/injection) were separated by reversed-phase LC in a 10 cm \u00d7 50 \u03bcm (i.d.) Phenomenex Jupiter 10 \u03bcm C18 self-packed capillary column using a linear gradient of 2\u201370% acetonitrile containing 0.05 M acetic acid in 50 min at a constant flow rate of 0.2 \u03bcl/min. The effluent was analyzed using a Finnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometry system equipped with a Protana microelectrospray ion source (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA) operated at 2.5 kV. Data interpretation was performed with the programs TurboSequest and Mascot. All matching spectra were verified by manual interpretation. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used to compare the extent of Ser-1106 phosphorylation in control scrambled si-RNA and si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b treated HCT-116 cells. The SRM experiment consisted of a 5-scan event analysis in which one scan event was a standard MS scan and the other four were different SRM descriptors directed to various sets of control or Ser-1106 containing peptides, both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated. To verify peptide recovery from the digestion procedure and the mass spectrometry response, one ion of the trypsin autolysis peptide VATVSLPR at m/z 422 (+2) and one ion of the unmodified topo II\u03b1 native peptide EVTFVPGLYK at m/z 577 (+2) were monitored. These two descriptors served as controls. In addition, the ion transition m/z 484 \u2192 m/z 435 (+2) characteristic for phosphate loss from phosphorylated Ser-29 contained in RLpS 29 VER peptide in topo II\u03b1 was monitored to confirm general phosphorylation of every sample. To determine the status of Ser-1106 phosphorylation, the peptide VPDEEENEES 1106 DNEKETEK containing phosphorylated Ser-1106 as doubly charged ( m/z 1116) or triply charged ( m/z 744) ion and their corresponding unphosphorylated peptide ions were monitored. DNA cleavable complex formation The effect of etoposide on forming a stable topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex was determined by measuring the amount of precipitated protein\u2013DNA complex and by evaluating depletion of topo II\u03b1 not complexed with DNA (band depletion). For measuring precipitated protein\u2013DNA complex, cells were labeled for 24 h with 0.02\u20130.04 \u03bcCi/ml of [ 14 C]-thymidine, specific activity 53 mCi/mmol (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). For measuring DNA cleavable complex in cells down-regulated for CKI\u03b4 plus CKI\u025b, cells were treated for 6 h with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKI\u03b4 plus si-CKI\u025b prior to labeling. Cells were then trypsinized, treated with etoposide for 1 h and the precipitated protein\u2013DNA complex was assayed as previously described ( 35 ). For the band depletion experiment cells were treated similarly without the addition of [ 14 C]-thymidine. Cell lysates were prepared in 2-fold concentrated LDS-sample buffer (Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The lysates were incubated at 70 \u00b0 C for 10 min, sonicated and centrifuged at 12 000 \u00d7 g . An aliquot (10\u201315 \u03bcl) of the lysate was subjected to western blot analysis. The membranes were probed with antibodies to topo II\u03b1 and topo I (internal control), which does not form a stabilized DNA cleavable complex with the topo II-targeted drug, etoposide. Down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b was also determined by western blotting with antibodies specific for CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b. RESULTS Inhibitors of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b (CKI-7 and IC261) lead to hypophosphorylation of the CNBr and tryptic topo II\u03b1 peptides containing Ser-1106 and reduce formation of etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex The presence of acidic amino-acid residues N-terminal to Ser-1106 and the Ca 2+ -dependency of phosphorylation of this site ( 18 ) suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-1106 may be regulated by protein kinase CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b. Therefore we first examined whether two CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, specific for CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b ( 36 ), altered phosphorylation of Ser-1106 containing peptides. Treatment of HL-60 cells with CKI-7 or IC261 led to hypophosphorylation of the CNBr (peptide 34) and tryptic phosphopeptides that were previously shown to harbor Ser-1106 ( Figures 1 A and 1B, respectively). Comparison of the intensity of spots corresponding to the peptides containing Ser-1106 (normalized to two other peptides) revealed that CKI-7 and IC-261 led to comparable decreases (20\u201340% and 25\u201330%, respectively) in phosphorylation of Ser-1106 as compared to untreated control cells. To determine whether decreased phosphorylation observed in the presence of CKI-7 or IC261 compromises the functional activity of topo II\u03b1, we examined the effect of CKI-7 and IC261 on formation of etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with 200 \u03bcM CKI-7 or 10 \u03bcM IC261 for 3 h prior to treatment with 5 \u03bcM etoposide for 1 h led to a significant ( P < 0.05) decrease in the formation of etoposide-stabilized DNA cleavable complex ( Figure 2 ). We also examined the effect of the CKII specific inhibitor, DRB, on formation of etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex. Pretreatment with 40 \u03bcM DRB did not alter etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex formation ( Figure 2 ). These results suggest a role for CKI\u03b4/\u025b in regulating the functional activity of topo II\u03b1 via phosphorylation at Ser-1106. Figure 2. The CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, but not the CKII inhibitor, DRB, decrease formation of etoposide-stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex. HL60 cells labeled overnight with 14 C-thymidine were pre-incubated in the absence or presence of CKI-7 (200 \u03bcM), IC261 (10 \u03bcM) or DRB (40 \u03bcM) for 3 h at 37 \u00b0 C. Cells were then washed, resuspended in inhibitor-free medium and incubated for an additional hour in etoposide (5 \u03bcM). Control, labeled cells were incubated in the presence of medium alone. The labeled DNA was precipitated with SDS\u2013KCl as described in Materials and methods section and the dpm in the precipitate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. DNA cleavable complex formation in the etoposide or inhibitor \u2192 etoposide treatment was determined by calculating the ratio of dpm in treated cells to control cells. *Significantly ( P < 0.05) lower than treatment with etoposide alone. Down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b with targeted si-RNA decreases phosphorylation of the tryptic peptide containing Ser-1106 To confirm the role of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b in phosphorylating Ser-1106 we down-regulated these two enzymes with three different sets of si-RNAs. These included si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b\u2014which targeted the nucleotide sequence (412\u2013430) that is identical in the CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b coding region; si-CKI\u03b4\u2014which is a smart pool targeted to the CKI\u03b4 isozyme; and si-CKI\u025b\u2014which is a smart pool targeted to the CKI\u025b isozyme. The si-CKI\u03b4 and si-CKI\u025b were used individually to down-regulate the specific isozyme or used in combination to simultaneously down-regulate both isozymes. Since, HL-60 cells are difficult to transfect we used the colon carcinoma cell line, HCT-116, for transfection of the si-RNAs. This cell line was chosen because it can be readily transfected and the phosphopeptide map of topo II\u03b1 in HCT-116 cells is similar to that in HL-60 cells (data not shown). Transfection of the three si-RNAs in HCT-116 cells led to significant down-regulation (\u223c60\u201380%) of the targeted isozyme; si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b and the combination of si-CKI\u03b4 and si-CKI\u025b led to down-regulation of both CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b, whereas si-CKI\u03b4 or si-CKI\u025b when used individually, down-regulated only the targeted enzyme CKI\u03b4 or CKI\u025b, respectively ( Figures 3 A, 5 A and 8 A). When both CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b were down-regulated a slight increase in the G 2 + M phase of the cell cycle was observed (data not shown). Figure 3. Phosphorylation of the topo II\u03b1 peptide containing Ser-1106 is reduced in HCT-116 cells transfected with si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b, but not in nocadazole treated cells arrested in the G 2 +M phase of the cell cycle. HCT-116 cells were transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b as described in Materials and methods section, or treated for 16 h in the absence or presence of 200 nM nocadazole. For cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b a small aliquot was lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to western blot analysis to determine down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CK1\u025b ( A ). The remaining transfected cells ( B ), and cells treated in the absence or presence of nocadazole ( C ) were labeled with [ 32 P] orthophosphoric acid for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with topo II\u03b1-specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitated topo II\u03b1 protein was subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The topo II\u03b1 band was excised, proteolysed with trypsin and the labeled tryptic peptides analyzed by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping. The isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/ n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water) (32.9/1/2.5/1.5/14.7, v/v) was used for resolving the peptides in the second dimension. The arrow indicates the position of Ser-1106 containing peptide. The down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b in HCT-116 cells transfected with si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b resulted in significantly decreased (75%) phosphorylation of the tryptic Ser-1106 containing phosphopeptide, as compared to cells transfected with the control scrambled si-RNA ( Figure 3 B). This was not due to an increase in the G 2 + M population observed in cells transfected with si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b, since phosphorylation at Ser-1106 was not affected when cells were blocked in mitosis following treatment with nocadazole ( Figure 3 C). Comparison of phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in topo II\u03b1 present in cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b by LC-MS ( Figure 4 ) revealed findings that were similar to those obtained by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping. Although both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Ser-1106 was detected in control cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA, only unphosphorylated Ser-1106 was detected in cells transfected with si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b. Down-regulation of only one isozyme, CKI\u03b4 or CKI\u025b ( Figure 5 A), also led to hypophosphorylation of the Ser-1106 containing peptide ( Figures 5 B and 5C, respectively), albeit to a lesser extent than that observed when both CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b were down-regulated ( Figure 3 B). In cells treated with si-CKI\u03b4, phosphorylation of Ser-1106 was 25\u201340% less than that observed in cells treated with scrambled si-RNA, whereas in cells treated with si-CKI\u025b phosphorylation of Ser-1106 was 40\u201365% less than that observed in cells treated with scrambled si-RNA. Differential hypophosphorylation of Ser-1106 in si-CKI\u03b4 and si-CKI\u025b transfected cells could be due to differences in the effectiveness of the two isozymes in phosphorylating this site or due to differential down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 (\u223c60%) and CKI\u025b (\u223c80%). Figure 4. Peptides containing phosphorylated Ser-1106 are not detected by LC-MS analysis of topo II\u03b1 from si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b transfected HCT-116 cells. HCT-116 cells were transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b. Topo II\u03b1 protein present in these cells was purified by immunoprecipitation and SDS\u2013PAGE. The stained topo II\u03b1 band in the gel was digested with trypsin and the peptides were analyzed by LC\u2013MS as described in Materials and methods section.

Down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 or CK1\u025b with targeted si-RNAs in HCT-116 cells decreases phosphorylation of the topo II\u03b1 peptide containing Ser-1106. HCT-116 cells were transfected with scrambled si-RNA, si-CKI\u03b4 or si-CKI\u025b as described in Materials and methods section. A small aliquot of the cells was lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to western blot analysis to determine down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b ( A ). The remaining cells were labeled with [ 32 P] orthophosphoric acid for 3 h, lysed in RIPA buffer and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with topo II\u03b1-specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitated topo II\u03b1 protein was subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The stained topo II\u03b1 band was excised, proteolysed with trypsin and the labeled tryptic peptides analyzed by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping ( B , C ). The isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/ n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water) (32.9/1/2.5/1.5/14.7, v/v) was used for resolving the peptides in the second dimension. The arrow indicates the position of Ser-1106 containing peptide. To confirm that phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in vivo does not involve CKII we examined the effect of transfecting HCT-116 cells with si-RNAs to CKII\u03b1 and CKII\u03b1\u2032 on phosphorylation of Ser-1106. Results of this experiment revealed that transfectants, in which CKII\u03b1 and CKII\u03b1\u2032 were significantly down-regulated ( Figure 6 A), did not exhibit altered phosphorylation of Ser-1106 although phosphorylation of other tryptic peptides previously reported to be substrates for casein kinase II ( 6 ) was reduced ( Figure 6 B). Figure 6. Down-regulation of CKII\u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 with targeted si-RNAs does not alter phosphorylation of the topo II\u03b1 peptide containing Ser-1106. An aliquot of HCT-116 cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si - CKII\u03b1 plus si-CKII\u03b1\u2032, as described in Materials and methods section, were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to western blot analysis to determine down-regulation of CKII\u03b1 and CKII\u03b1\u2032 ( A ). The remaining cells were labeled with [ 32 P] orthophosphoric acid for 3 h. Cell lysates prepared in RIPA buffer were immunoprecipitated with topo II\u03b1-specific antibodies, subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The stained topo II\u03b1 band was excised, proteolysed with trypsin and the labeled tryptic peptides analyzed by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping ( B ). The isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/ n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water) (32.9/1/2.5/1.5/14.7, v/v) was used for resolving the peptides in the second dimension. The arrow indicates the position of Ser-1106 containing peptide. Phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in human topo II\u03b1 expressed in HRR25\u0394 S. cerevisae cells is reduced, but can be enhanced following transformation of the cells with human CKI\u025b Since human topo II\u03b1 expressed in S . cerevisiae cells is phosphorylated at Ser-1106 ( 18 ) and the S. cerevisiae gene, HRR25 is homologous to CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b ( 37 ), we compared phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in WT or HRR25\u0394 cells transformed with human topo II\u03b1. As shown in Figure 7 A, phosphorylation of the tryptic Ser-1106 peptide was significantly reduced in HRR25\u0394 cells. Transformation of the HRR25\u0394 cells expressing human topo II\u03b1 with human CKI\u025b enhanced phosphorylation at Ser-1106 ( Figure 7 B). This finding provides further support for the role of CKI\u03b4/\u025b, in particular the CKI\u025b isozyme, in regulating phosphorylation at Ser-1106 in topo II\u03b1. Figure 7. Phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in human topo II\u03b1 expressing HRR25\u0394 S. cerevisae cells is reduced, but can be enhanced following transformation of the cells with human CKI\u025b. WT W303 cells or HRR25\u0394 isolate isogenic to W303 cells transformed with human topo II\u03b1 ( A ), or topo II\u03b1 expressing HRR25\u0394 W303 cells transformed with vector control or human CKI\u025b cDNA ( B ) were labeled with [ 32 P] orthophosphoric acid for 1 h as described in Materials and methods section. Topo II\u03b1 from cell lysates prepared in Y-PER lysis buffer was purified by Ni 2+ -nitrilotriacetic acid or immunoprecipitated with topo II\u03b1 antibody. Purified topo II\u03b1 was subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The stained topo II\u03b1 band was excised, proteolysed with trypsin and the labeled tryptic peptides analyzed by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping. The phosphochromatography buffer, n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water (5/3.3/1/4, v/v), was used for separating the peptides in the second dimension (A) and the isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/ n -butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water) (32.9/1/2.5/1.5/14.7, v/v) was used for resolving the peptides in the second dimension (B). The arrow indicates the position of Ser-1106 containing peptide. Figure 8. Down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b in HCT-116 cells leads to reduced topo II\u03b1\u2013DNA cleavage activity. HCT-116 cells were treated with scrambled si-CKI\u03b4 (75 nM) plus si-CKI\u025b (75 nM) as described in Materials and methods section and subsequently treated with etoposide for 1 h. An aliquot of the cell lysate was used to determine down regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b ( A ). Cells labeled with [ 14 C] thymidine were lysed and precipitated with SDS\u2013KCl. The dpm present in the precipitate was determined by liquid scintillation counting ( B ). *Significantly ( P < 0.01) lower than scrambled si-RNA-treated cells. Band depletion of topo II\u03b1 not present in the etoposide\u2013stabilized DNA complex was determined by western blotting of lysates prepared in 2-fold concentrated LDS-sample buffer ( C ). The amount of topo II\u03b1 was normalized with topo I, which does not form a stable complex with the topo II-targeted drug, etoposide. Reduced phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in HCT-116 cells transfected with si-CKI\u03b4 plus si-CKI\u025b leads to decreased formation of etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex We previously demonstrated a functional role for Ser-1106 phosphorylation in topo II\u03b1, based on the observation that mutation of Ser-1106 to alanine in human topo II\u03b1 led to decreased topo II\u03b1 function in vitro and in vivo in JN394 yeast cells transformed with human topo II\u03b1 ( 18 ). In this study we examined whether topo II\u03b1 function is affected when phosphorylation at Ser-1106 is altered by down-regulating the kinase(s), CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b, involved in phosphorylating this residue. Down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b by si-CKI\u03b4 plus si-CKI\u025b ( Figure 8 A) led to a significant ( P < 0.01) decrease in SDS\u2013KCl precipitable 14 C-thymidine labeled etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex ( Figure 8 B). Since, formation of a stable topo II\u03b1\u2013DNA cleavable complex in the presence of etoposide leads to depletion of topo II\u03b1 not complexed with DNA, we also determined the amount of topo II\u03b1 in lysates of control or etoposide-treated HCT-116 cells that were transiently transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKI\u03b4 plus si-CKI\u025b. In cells transfected with si-CKI\u03b4 plus si-CKI\u025b depletion of topo II\u03b1 following treatment with etoposide was less (\u223c40\u201350%) than that observed in cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA ( Figure 8 C). This finding corroborates the previous data demonstrating decreased formation of the etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex in cells transfected with si-CKI\u03b4 plus si-CKI\u025b. These results indicate that CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b are involved in regulating topo II\u03b1 function via phosphorylation at Ser-1106. DISCUSSION In the present study we identify CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b as upstream kinase(s) regulating in vivo phosphorylation of topo II\u03b1 at Ser-1106 and thereby modulating the DNA cleavage activity of the enzyme. The role of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b in phosphorylating Ser-1106 is based on several lines of experimental evidence. In vivo phosphorylation of the tryptic peptide that contains Ser-1106 is decreased when CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b are inhibited by the CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261 (specific for CKI\u03b4/\u025b), or when CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b are down-regulated by targeted si-RNAs. Similarly, in human topo II\u03b1 expressing HRR25 (CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b homologous gene) deleted S. cerevisiae cells, the tryptic peptide containing Ser-1106 is also hypophosphorylated, and phosphorylation at this site can be enhanced following transformation of these cells with human CKI\u025b. The decrease in phosphorylation of the Ser-1106 tryptic peptide is indeed due to reduced phosphorylation at this site, since our earlier studies indicated that in vivo phosphorylation of this tryptic peptide was not observed when Ser-1106 in topo II\u03b1 was mutated to alanine ( 18 ). Furthermore, LC\u2013MS analysis of phosphorylated Ser-1106 in topo II\u03b1 obtained from HCT-116 cells treated with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKI\u03b4/\u025b revealed the presence of phosphorylated Ser-1106 only in scrambled si-RNA treated cells. The decrease in phosphorylation at Ser-1106 observed in cells exhibiting reduced kinase activity of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b correlates with a decrease in topo II\u03b1 function. Inhibition of the CKI activity in cells treated with CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 or IC-261 leads to reduced formation of topo II\u2013drug DNA complex in vivo . Similarly, when CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b are down-regulated by targeted si-RNAs, formation of the etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex is reduced. These results indicate that the phosphorylation at Ser-1106 catalyzed by CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b enhances the in vivo DNA cleavage activity of topo II\u03b1. Several different kinases, including CKII, protein kinase C, proline directed kinases e.g. cdc2 and Polo-like kinase 1 have been reported to phosphorylate topo II\u03b1 ( 6 , 9\u201317 ). However, this is the first report demonstrating CKI as a physiologically relevant kinase that modulates phosphorylation and activity of topo II\u03b1. Our data demonstrating decreased phosphorylation of several peptides (excluding the Ser-1106 containing peptide) following down-regulation of CKII\u03b1 and CKII\u03b1\u2032 with targeted si-RNAs provides evidence that CKII is also capable of phosphorylating topo II\u03b1 in vivo . However, phosphorylation at CKII sites does not significantly affect sensitivity to topoII-targeted drugs, since treatment of HL-60 cells with the CKII inhibitor, DRB, did not significantly alter formation of topo II-drug\u2013DNA complex in vivo . Since our study did not evaluate the effect of reduced phosphorylation at CKII sites on other functions of topo II\u03b1, the functional role of phosphorylations at CKII sites remains unclear. It is possible that phosphorylation at CKII sites, most of which map to regions in the C-terminal domain, along with other phosphorylations within this region regulate accessibility of the catalytic site to its substrate. This mechanism would be analogous to that described for regulation of the activity of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b, wherein dephosphorylation of the C-terminal region activates the enzyme. Our previous data demonstrating Ca 2+ -dependent phosphorylation of Ser-1106 ( 18 ), provides further support for the role of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b (Ca 2+ -regulatable enzymes), but not CKII, as physiologic kinases that modulate Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Although, the catalytic activity of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b does not require Ca 2+ , these enzymes can be regulated via Ca 2+ -dependent dephosphorylation or proteolysis ( 25 , 26 ). In neostriatal neurons, the metabotrophic glutamate receptors activate CKI\u025b by dephosphorylating the inhibitory C-terminal autophosphorylation sites by the Ca 2+ -dependent phosphatase, calcineurin ( 38 ). The activated CKI\u025b then leads to phosphorylation of Ser-137 of DARPP-32. A scenario similar to that described in neostriatal muscles, could explain how phosphorylation of Ser-1106 is regulated by Ca 2+ . Dephosphorylation by calcineurin and subsequent activation of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b could result in phosphorylation of Ser-1106. Alternatively, a Ca 2+ -dependent protease, e.g. calpain, which is activated by calcium influx in neurons ( 27 , 39 ), could remove the inhibitory domain in CKI\u03b4 or CKI\u025b and lead to activation of these kinases. CKI isozymes are involved in regulating several different cellular processes ( 40 ). The CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b isozymes have been shown to modulate the development process because of their role in the wnt signaling pathway. In addition, these isozymes play a role in circadian rhythm, cell division, apoptosis and neurodegenerative diseases. CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b phosphorylate p53, tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins to regulate cell growth, chromosome segregation and stress response at the spindle apparatus and the mitotic centrosome. The identification of topo II\u03b1, which is also involved in regulating DNA replication and cell division, chromosome segregation and DNA repair, as another nuclear substrate of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b in this study, suggests that these CKI isozymes may be essential for regulating various aspects of DNA metabolism. In this regard, topo II\u03b1 could function as part of a protein complex that comprises of transcription factors, nuclear regulatory proteins and kinases (including CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b)/phosphatases that regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of components of the complex. Thus, it would be important to determine whether CKI\u03b4 or CKI\u025b is capable of associating with topo II\u03b1. In summary our results demonstrate that CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b are physiologically relevant kinase(s) that are involved in regulating site-specific phosphorylation at Ser-1106 and modulating the function of topo II\u03b1. Since Ser-1106 phosphorylation regulates sensitivity of cells to topo II-targeted drugs and expression of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b can be altered in cancer cells, one potential mechanism by which tumor cells develop resistance to topo II-targeted drugs could involve decrease in expression or activation of CKI\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b. The correlation of Ser-1106 hypophosphorylation with etoposide resistance was not only observed in cell culture model systems but was also seen in blast cells isolated from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Comparison of Ser-1106 phosphorylation with etoposide induced apoptosis revealed that reduced phosphorylation at Ser-1106 was associated with decreased apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, it might be possible to identify sensitivity of tumors to topo II\u03b1-targeting drugs by characterizing phosphorylation at Ser-1106 or by determining the expression level or activity of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b in tumor samples.

    "full_text_abstract": "We previously reported that phosphorylation of topoisomerase (topo) II\u03b1 at serine-1106 (Ser-1106) regulates enzyme activity and sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs. In this study we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-1106, which is flanked by acidic amino acids, is regulated in vivo by casein kinase (CK) I\u03b4 and/or CKI\u025b, but not by CKII. The CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, reduced Ser-1106 phosphorylation and decreased formation of etoposide-stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex. In contrast, the CKII inhibitor, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, did not affect etoposide-stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex formation. Since, IC261 specifically targets the Ca 2+ -regulated isozymes, CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b, we examined the effect of down-regulating these enzymes on Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Down-regulation of these isozymes with targeted si-RNAs led to hypophosphorylation of the Ser-1106 containing peptide. However, si-RNA-mediated down-regulation of CKII\u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 did not alter Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Furthermore, reduced phosphorylation of Ser-1106, observed in HRR25 (CKI\u03b4/\u025b homologous gene)-deleted Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with human topo II\u03b1, was enhanced following expression of human CKI\u025b. Down-regulation of CKI\u03b4 and CKI\u025b also led to reduced formation of etoposide stabilized topo II\u2013DNA cleavable complex. These results provide strong support for an essential role of CKI\u03b4/\u025b in phosphorylating Ser-1106 in human topo II\u03b1 and in regulating enzyme function."
