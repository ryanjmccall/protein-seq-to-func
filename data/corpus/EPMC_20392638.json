    "abstract_text": "A series of N-(2-amino-5-substituted phenyl)benzamides (3-21) were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their inhibition of HDAC2 and their cytotoxicity in HCT116 cancer cells. Multiple compounds from this series demonstrated time-dependent binding kinetics that is rationalized using a co-complex crystal structure of HDAC2 and N-(4-aminobiphenyl-3-yl)benzamide (6).",
