    "abstract_text": "With more than 30 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved and annual global sales of the products at ~$50 billion in 2010, these products have proven to be successful in many ways. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement in performance, and substantial unmet medical needs remain. As a consequence, numerous organizations are devoting resources to engineering novel mAbs such as bispecific antibodies that have increased functionality compared with unmodified IgG molecules. The World Bispecific Antibody Summit, organized by Hanson Wade, drew over 100 participants to Boston to discuss engineering novel bispecific antibodies, generating lead candidates and clinical study and commercialization of the molecules. Approaches such as the trifunctional antibody (TRION), dual variable domain-Ig (Abbott), two-in-one (Genentech), dual affinity retargeting (MacroGenics), kappa-lambda body (NovImmune), bispecific T-cell engager (Micromet) and chemical generation (CovX/Pfizer) were discussed in detail. In addition, posters describing bispecific Affibody\u00ae molecules for targeting of EGFR and HER2 (Affibody), T-cell receptor based bi-specifics that target HLA-peptides (Immunocore), a novel mAb-Fv bispecific antibody format utilizing Fc region (Xencore), generation of a tetravalent bispecific antibody against IL4 and IL13 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Sanofi), Combining Affibody\u00ae molecules and the Albumod\u2122 technology to create long acting multispecific protein therapeutics (Royal Institute of Technology, Affibody) and COVA301 as a highly potent bispecific inhibitor of IL-17A and TNF-\u03b1 (Covagen) were presented.",
