  "title": "A novel mutation in HESX1 causes combined pituitary hormone deficiency without septo optic dysplasia phenotypes.",

  "abstract_text": "Heterozygous and/or homozygous HESX1 mutations have been reported to cause isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) or combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), in association with septo optic dysplasia (SOD). We report a novel heterozygous HESX1 mutation in a CPHD patient without SOD phenotypes. The propositus was a one-year-old Japanese girl. Shortly after birth, she was found to be hypoglycemic. She was diagnosed with central adrenal insufficiency based on low cortisol and ACTH at a time of severe hypoglycemia. Further endocrine studies indicated that the patient also had central hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency. Using a next-generation sequencing strategy, we identified a novel heterozygous HESX1 mutation, c.326G>A (p.Arg109Gln). Western blotting and subcellular localization revealed no significant difference between wild type and mutant HESX1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the mutant HESX1 abrogated DNA-binding ability. Mutant HESX1 was unable to repress PROP1-mediated activation. In conclusion, this study identified Arg109 as a critical residue in the HESX1 protein and extends our understanding of the phenotypic features, molecular mechanism, and developmental course associated with mutations in HESX1. When multiple genes need to be analyzed for mutations simultaneously, targeted sequence analysis of interesting genomic regions is an attractive approach.",
