    "abstract_text": "A series of novel maleimide-based inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. AEB071 (1) was found to be a potent, selective inhibitor of classical and novel PKC isotypes. 1 is a highly efficient immunomodulator, acting via inhibition of early T cell activation. The binding mode of maleimides to PKCs, proposed by molecular modeling, was confirmed by X-ray analysis of 1 bound in the active site of PKCalpha.",
