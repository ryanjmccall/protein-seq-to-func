  "abstract_text": "S-nitrosation is a posttranslational, oxidative addition of NO to cysteine residues of proteins that has been proposed as a cGMP-independent signaling pathway [Hess DT, Matsumoto A, Kim SO, Marshall HE, Stamler JS (2005) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 6:150-166]. A paradox of S-nitrosation is that only a small set of reactive cysteines are modified in vivo despite the promiscuous reactivity NO exhibits with thiols, precluding the reaction of free NO as the primary mechanism of S-nitrosation. Here we show that a specific transnitrosation reaction between procaspase-3 and thioredoxin-1 (Trx) occurs in cultured human T cells and prevents apoptosis. Trx participation in catalyzing transnitrosation reactions in cells may be general because this protein has numerous protein-protein interactions and plays a key role in cellular redox homeostasis [Powis G, Montfort WR (2001) Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 41:261-295], nitrosothiol content in cells [Haendeler J, Hoffmann J, Tischler V, Berk BC, Zeiher AM, Dimmeler S (2002) Nat Cell Biol 4:743-749], and antiapoptotic signaling.",
