    "abstract_text": "Inhibitory and activatory C-type lectin-like receptors play an important role in immunity through the regulation of leukocytes. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor (MICL) whose expression is primarily restricted to granulocytes and monocytes. This receptor, which contains a single C-type lectin-like domain and a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, is related to LOX-1 (lectin-like receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein-1) and the beta-glucan receptor (Dectin-1) and is variably spliced and highly N-glycosylated. We demonstrate that it preferentially associates with the signaling phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, but not with SHIP. Novel chimeric analyses with a construct combining MICL and the beta-glucan receptor show that MICL can inhibit cellular activation through its cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. These data suggest that MICL is a negative regulator of granulocyte and monocyte function.",
