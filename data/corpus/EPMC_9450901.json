  "abstract_text": "Mutations in the p53 gene have been reported in head and neck carcinomas. We determined the p53 mutation profile in 55 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) from a black African population sample. DNA from all the patients were investigated using PCR amplification of the p53 gene (exons 5-9), followed by heteroduplex single-stranded conformational polymorphism (HEX-SSCP) analysis on the PCR products. Direct sequencing was performed on cases where mutations were identified. The results showed mutations in 13 of 55 (23.6%) tumours. Eleven of 13 (85%) were single base pair substitutions (9 transitions and 2 transversions), and 2 were deletions. Two novel mutations were identified: a large 63-base pair deletion, and a single base pair substitution. The mutations in our study occurred outside the head and neck tumour hot spot region (codons 238-248).",
