    "abstract_text": "The protection and efficient restart of stalled replication forks is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we identify a regulatory pathway that promotes stalled forks recovery from replication stress. We show that the mammalian replisome component C20orf43/RTF2 (homologous to S.\u00a0pombe Rtf2) must be removed for fork restart to be optimal. We further show that the proteasomal shuttle proteins DDI1 and DDI2 are required for RTF2 removal from stalled forks. Persistence of RTF2 at stalled forks results in fork restart defects, hyperactivation of the DNA damage signal, accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), sensitivity to replication drugs, and chromosome instability. These results establish that RTF2 removal is a key determinant for the ability of cells to manage replication stress and maintain genome integrity.",
