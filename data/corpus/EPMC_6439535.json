  "abstract_text": "We have isolated and characterized the gene for human apolipoprotein CIII, a major component of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Determination of the complete DNA sequence of this gene revealed that the coding sequence is interrupted by three introns, which occur in the 5' noncoding region, in the region encoding the signal sequence and in the region coding for the mature plasma protein, respectively. We present an analysis of the structure of the apo CIII gene and compare it to the gene for apolipoprotein AI. In addition, we present the DNA sequence of the intergenic region lying between the apo AI and the apo CIII genes.",
