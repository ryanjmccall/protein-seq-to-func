    "abstract_text": "The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in ubiquitous and plays a role in every tissue of the body. It is comprised of ligands, receptors and binding proteins, each with specific functions. While it plays an essential role in embryonic and post-natal development, the IGF system is also important in normal adult physiology. There are now numerous examples of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and malnutrition in which the IGF system is a major player and, not surprisingly, there are attempts to affect these disorders by manipulating the system.",
