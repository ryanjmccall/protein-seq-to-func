    "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase that acts as a critical mediator of cell proliferation and survival. This receptor is over-expressed or activated in tumor cells and is emerging as a novel target in cancer therapy. Efforts in our \"Hit to Lead\" group have generated a novel series of submicromolar IGF-1R inhibitors based on a isoquinolinedione template originating from a Lance enzyme HTS screen. Chemical triage and parallel synthesis incorporating focused library arrays were instrumental in moving these investigations through the Wyeth exploratory medicinal chemistry process. The strategies, synthesis, and SAR behind this interesting kinase scaffold will be described.",
