    "abstract_text": "The human growth hormone-variant (hGH-V) gene is one of five highly similar growth hormone-related genes clustered on the short arm of chromosome 17. Although the pattern of expression of the adjacent normal growth hormone (hGH-N) and chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) genes in this cluster are well characterized, the expression of the hGH-V gene remains to be defined. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the hGH-V gene is transcribed in the term placenta and expressed as two alternatively spliced mRNAs: one is predicted to encode a 22-kD hormone (hGH-V), the other retains intron 4 in its sequence resulting in the predicted synthesis of a novel 26-kD hGH-V-related protein (hGH-V2). In the present report, we document the expression of both of these hGH-V mRNA species in the villi of the term placenta, demonstrate an increase in their concentrations during gestation, and directly sublocalize hGH-V gene expression to the syncytiotrophoblastic epithelium of the term placenta by in situ cDNA-mRNA histohybridization. The demonstrated similarity in the developmental and tissue-specific expression of the hGH-V gene with that of the related hCS gene suggests that these two genes may share common regulatory elements.",
