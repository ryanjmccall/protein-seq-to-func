    "abstract_text": "Several pathways have been implicated in the establishment of antiviral state in response to interferon (IFN), one of which implicates the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. The PML gene has been discovered 20 years ago and has led to new insights into oncogenesis, apoptosis, cell senescence, and antiviral defense. PML is induced by IFN, leading to a marked increase of expression of PML isoforms and the number of PML nuclear bodies (NBs). PML is the organizer of the NBs that contains at least 2 permanent NB-associated proteins, the IFN-stimulated gene product Speckled protein of 100 kDa (Sp100) and death-associated dead protein (Daxx), as well as numerous other transient proteins recruited in these structures in response to different stimuli. Accumulating reports have implicated PML in host antiviral defense and revealed various strategies developed by viruses to disrupt PML NBs. This review will focus on the regulation of PML and the implication of PML NBs in conferring resistance to DNA and RNA viruses. The role of PML in mediating an IFN-induced antiviral state will also be discussed.",
