Abia\u00e1n Laboratorio de Prote\u00f3mica-CSIC/UAB, IIBB-CSIC, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain T lymphocytes mediate cellular and humoral defense against foreign bodies or autoantigens. Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation is involved in many aspects of lymphocyte activation. In this context we are interested in the characterization of phosphoproteins and p-sites in human primary T-cells and we are studying the quantitative changes produced by different activators on the phosphoproteome of these cells. For qualitative analysis we used a strategy based on a multidimensional separation, involving preparative SDS-PAGE for prefractionation, Indiana, USA-gel digestion and sequential phosphopeptide enrichment using IMAC and TiO2 before LC-MSn analysis in an LTQ linear ion trap. Quantitative analyses are being performed by 2D-PAGE as well as by LC MS/MS using ITRAQ labeling. Using these procedures we have identified more than 400 high confidence p-sites in resting cells, some of which had not been described previously, and quantified near 150 p-sites in resting lymphocytes vs lymphocytes treated for 4-hours with PMA-ionomicine. The complementarily of both enrichment techniques is also shown.1 The complete set of data obtained so far is stored in our LymPHOS database that is publicly available at http://lymphos.org.2 We have implemented an automatic workflow for the annotation of the database that includes tools for MS data filtering and accurate phosphorylation site assignation. The information stored in the database comprises most experimental and spectrometric data and data analysis information. All the spectra supporting each assignation are stored and presented in graphical form. Experimental data for each experiment is provided in a document that follows PSI MIAPE guidelines. This data constitutes the only phosphorylation map available for human primary T-lymphocytes. Several novel lymphocyte specific p-sites are described and these could be a source of information for future studies on the role of phosphorylation in T-cell functions and the effect of pharmacological and immunological agonists and conditions in T-lymphocyte activation.

San Francisco, CA; 4Technion Institute, Haifa, Israel The assembly of a ubiquitin signal on a protein substrate requires the coordinated actions of E1-activating, E2-conjugating and E3-ligase enzymes. Ubiquitin signals are recognized by ubiquitin receptor proteins that recruit modified substrates to the proteasome for degradation or into a multi-protein signaling/trafficking complexes. Both of these processes are opposed by ubiquitin isopeptides which disassemble ubiquitin signals and prevent ubiquitin dependent processes. Recent evidence suggests that fine tuning of cellular processes by the ubiquitin system can occur through the process of ubiquitin editing or chain remodeling- conversion of one ubiquitin signal into another by concerted disassembly and reassembly efforts. To further investigate this process and evaluate its role in cells, we have implemented the Ubiquitin-AQUA method. Ubiquitin-AQUA measures the amount of each polyubiquitin linkage relative to isotopically labeled internal standard peptides designed toward the tryptic branched signature peptides. Isotopically labeled unbranched peptides from ubiquitin are used to quantify the total amount of ubiquitin. Digested peptides and isotopically labeled standards are analyzed either by narrow window extracted ion chromatograms on a high resolution LTQ-Orbitrap or by multiple reaction monitoring on a QTrap mass spectrometer. To improve analysis of the N-terminus of ubiquitin and as well as signature peptides toward K6-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains, we have defined conditions for oxidizing these Met containing peptides to the sulfoxide and sulfone states. Quantification of total ubiquitin based upon multiple loci is performed to minimize possible interference from complex ubiquitin signals. Using these methods we provide evidence that the majority of substrate bound ubiquitin in cells at the steady state is conjugated to substrates as mono- rather than poly-ubiquitin. Furthermore, by combining quantitative mass spectrometry with ubiquitin linkage specific antibodies, we can show that polyubiquitinated substrates purified from cells may be modified by more than one chain linkage. These observations provide a cellular context to our growing understanding of ubiquitin editing. 6.3 Age Determination in the Adult Human Brain and Body Using Bomb-Carbon K. L. Spalding1, O.

Without knowing, however, if a specific cell type is renewed in the healthy or pathological situation, it remains uncertain whether it may be realistic and rational to modulate this process. Despite the importance of this information, remarkably little is known about the age of cells in many regions of the adult human brain and body. This is largely due to difficulties in studying this process in humans. Using recently established methodology, which integrates biomedical approaches with recent developments in nuclear physics, it is possible to establish the turnover of cells in human tissues. By measuring 14C derived from nuclear bomb tests in DNA, it is possible to retrospectively establish the birth date of cells. Findings of neuronal turnover in the adult human brain, fat cell turnover in humans (lean and obese), and age-determination in humans will be discussed.",
