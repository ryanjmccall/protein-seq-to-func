    "abstract_text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors are key regulators of angiogenesis and are potential targets in cancer therapy. Here we report the down-regulation of activated VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1/Flt-1 by endocytosis and proteolytic degradation. VEGF stimulation induced a ternary complex of Flt-1, c-Cbl, and CD2AP. Substitution of tyrosine 1333 in Flt-1 with phenylalanine (Y1333F) impaired its binding to c-Cbl. In a transient expression system, VEGF stimulated colocalization of Flt-1, CD2AP, and c-Cbl in endocytic vesicles. This colocalization was significantly impaired by an inhibitor of VEGFR kinase SU5416, the Y1333F mutation in Flt-1, or by a dominant negative form of CD2AP. In Flt-1-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells, expression of the wild-type CD2AP enhanced VEGF-stimulated internalization as well as ubiquitination of Flt-1 whereas that of a mutated form of either CD2AP or c-Cbl failed to do so. These results suggest that the c-Cbl/CD2AP complex binds to activated Flt-1 and plays a crucial role in its endocytosis and subsequent degradation.",
