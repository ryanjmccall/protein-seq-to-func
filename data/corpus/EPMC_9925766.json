    "abstract_text": "S100B (S100beta) and S100A6 (calcyclin) are two 10-kDa Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding proteins coexpressed in melanoma and cell-cycle regulated. These proteins are members of the S100 subfamily and are thought to exert their function through interaction with intracellular target proteins. In order to search for potential target proteins interacting with S100B, we used a yeast two-hybrid strategy with human S100B as bait to screen a human brain cDNA library. The fusion proteins interacting with the S100B bait were identified as S100B, S100A1, and S100A6. This indicates the potential of S100B to form homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the S100 subfamily. By Northern and Western blotting, S100B and S100A6 were shown to be expressed at high levels in a panel of human melanoma cell lines. S100B and S100A6 were coimmunoprecipitated from melanoma cell lysates in the presence of 100 microM Zn2+. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that both proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and concentrated in the nucleus. The demonstration of an association and colocalization of S100B and S100A6 in melanoma supports the possibility that an S100B/S100A6 heterodimer plays a functional role in these cells.",
