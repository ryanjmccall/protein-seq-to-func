    "abstract_text": "Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) has critical roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation during animal development and adult homeostasis. Here, we show that human Nedd4 (Nedd4-1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase comprised of a C2 domain, 4 WW domains, and a Hect domain, regulates endocytosis and signalling of FGFR1. Nedd4-1 binds directly to and ubiquitylates activated FGFR1, by interacting primarily via its WW3 domain with a novel non-canonical sequence (non-PY motif) on FGFR1. Deletion of this recognition motif (FGFR1-\u03946) abolishes Nedd4-1 binding and receptor ubiquitylation, and impairs endocytosis of activated receptor, as also observed upon Nedd4-1 knockdown. Accordingly, FGFR1-\u03946, or Nedd4-1 knockdown, exhibits sustained FGF-dependent receptor Tyr phosphorylation and downstream signalling (activation of FRS2\u03b1, Akt, Erk1/2, and PLC\u03b3). Expression of FGFR1-\u03946 in human embryonic neural stem cells strongly promotes FGF2-dependent neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, expression of this FGFR1-\u03946 mutant in zebrafish embryos disrupts anterior neuronal patterning (head development), consistent with excessive FGFR1 signalling. These results identify Nedd4-1 as a key regulator of FGFR1 endocytosis and signalling during neuronal differentiation and embryonic development.",
