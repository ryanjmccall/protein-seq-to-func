    "abstract_text": "Human cancer progression is driven in part by the mutation of oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes which, under selective environmental pressures, give rise to evolving populations of biochemically altered cells with enhanced tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Given that human cancers are biologically and pathologically quite distinct, it has been quite surprising that a common event, perturbation of the p53 pathway, occurs in most if not all types of human cancers. The central role of p53 as a tumour-suppressor protein has fuelled interest in defining its mechanism of function and regulation, determining how its inactivation facilitates cancer progression, and exploring the possibility of restoring p53 function for therapeutic benefit. This review will highlight the key biochemical properties of p53 protein that affect its tumour-suppressor function and the experimental strategies that have been developed for the re-activation of the p53 pathway in cancers.",
