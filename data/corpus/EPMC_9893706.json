    "abstract_text": "The discovery and cloning of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) gave rise to new hopes for a significant victory in the war against cancer. Preclinical in vitro studies in cell cultures and in vivo studies in animal models demonstrated the antitumor capacities of TNF. Although clinical studies were largely made possible by the availability of recombinant TNF, phase I and II clinical trials showed very quickly that the systemic administration of TNF induced severe side effects mainly due to its pleiotropic action on immunocompetent cells. The clinical manifestations of the side effects were similar to those observed during a severe infection and inflammation. Very recently, lessons from these clinical studies yielded refined approaches whereby the toxicity of TNF is limited through local administration, a combination with other therapeutic regimens and targeted gene therapy. These new approaches are slated for larger clinical trials and in the near future might demonstrate the limited but powerful usefulness of TNF as an antineoplastic agent for different types of cancer.",
