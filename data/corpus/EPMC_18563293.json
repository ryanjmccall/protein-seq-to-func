  "abstract_text": "Src-family kinases are modular signaling proteins involved in a diverse array of cellular processes. All members of the Src family share the same domain organization, with modular SH3, SH2 and kinase domains followed by a C-terminal negative regulatory tail. X-ray crystallographic analyses of several Src family members have revealed critical roles for the SH3 and SH2 domains in the down-regulation of the kinase domain. This review focuses on biological, biophysical, and computational studies that reveal conformationally distinct active states within this unique kinase family.",
