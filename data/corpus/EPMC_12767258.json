    "abstract_text": "Different cellular pathways can lead to apoptosis. Apaf1 is the molecular core of the apoptosome, a multiproteic complex mediating the so-called mitochondrial pathway of cell death. The importance of this pathway during development has been clearly demonstrated by knocking out key genes. Also, the relevance of Apaf1 dosage during development has been recently underlined. Moreover, a growing body of evidences seems to point out a possible role of the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in different pathologies. In particular, we discuss here some recent evidences regarding the putative role of the apoptosome in neurodegeneration and cancer.",
