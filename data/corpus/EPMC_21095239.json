  "abstract_text": "The glycoprotein erythropoietin (Epo) is a hematopoietic cytokine necessary for the survival of erythrocytes from immature erythroid cells. The mitogen-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) plays an important role in the proliferation and survival of erythroid cells in response to Epo. However, the precise mechanism of JNK1 activation promoting erythroid cell survival is incompletely understood. Here, we reported that JNK1 is required for Epo-mediated cell survival through phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic, Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only Bcl-associated death protein (Bad). Upon Epo withdrawal, HCD57 cells, a murine Epo-dependent cell line, displayed increased apoptotic cell death that was associated with decreased JNK1 activity. Epo withdrawal-induced apoptosis was promoted by inhibition of JNK1 activity but suppressed by expression of a constitutively active JNK1. Furthermore, Epo-activated JNK1 phosphorylated Bad at threonine 201, thereby inhibiting the association of Bad with the anti-apoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-X(L)). Replacement of threonine 201 by alanine in Bad promoted Epo withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Thus, our results provide a molecular mechanism by which JNK1 contributes to the survival of erythroid cells.",
