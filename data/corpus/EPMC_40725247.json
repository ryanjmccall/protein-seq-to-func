Introduction In recent years, research into marine organisms has revealed a wealth of bioactive compounds with significant implications for human health. The sea cucumber ( Holothuria scabra ), often referred to as “the Ginseng of the sea” in Japan, China, Korea, and Hong Kong, is consumed for its reputed medical properties [ 1 ]. Bioactive compounds extracted from H. scabra have been utilized in traditional medicine and have shown potential applications in wound healing, immune modulation, anti-cancer treatments, protection against degenerative processes, and neuroprotection [ 2 , 3 , 4 ]. Notably, a previous study identified a conserved family of growth factor and receptor genes in H. scabra , which are critical in directing tissue repair and regeneration [ 5 , 6 ]. Although activin and inhibin from H. scabra have been reported and characterized, details their expression and proposed function remain limited [ 6 ]. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, which includes activin and inhibin, plays fundamental roles in cellular signaling, embryonic development, immune regulation, reproduction, extracellular matrix remodeling, and tissue repair in both vertebrates and many invertebrates [ 7 , 8 ]. Activin and inhibin are dimeric glycoproteins within this superfamily of cytokines [ 9 ]. Activin typically comprises two β subunits (βA or βB), while inhibin consists of an α subunit linked to a β subunit (βA, βB, or βC) [ 10 , 11 ]. These structural differences result in distinct biological functions. Activin mainly regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, whereas inhibin functions as a negative regulator of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, playing a crucial role in reproductive feedback regulation [ 12 , 13 ]. Beyond their reproductive roles, activin and inhibin are involved in diverse physiological processes. Activin A, for example, has been shown to suppress epithelial growth in developing gastrointestinal organs in rats and induce apoptosis in rapidly proliferating cells of the forestomach and glandular stomach [ 14 ]. In the nervous system, activin is critical for neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival [ 15 ]. Moreover, activin suppresses the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), thereby reducing neuroinflammation and promoting wound healing [ 16 , 17 ]. These findings underscore the broad physiological roles of activin and inhibin, highlighting their potential therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine, metabolic disorders, and neuroprotection [ 9 , 17 ]. TGF-β receptor type I (TGFBR1), also known as activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5), is a serine/threonine kinase vital for mediating TGF-β signaling. Upon ligand binding, TGF-β ligands engage the type II receptor (TGFBR2), which recruits and phosphorylates TGFBR1. This activation initiates downstream signaling cascades that regulate gene expression [ 18 ]. Under normal physiological conditions, TGFBR1 signaling is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune responses, and extracellular matrix production. It is also essential for preserving tissue integrity, contributing to processes such as wound healing, tissue repair, and immune tolerance [ 19 ]. In cancer cells, TGFBR1 exhibits a dual role depending on the tumor stage. During early tumorigenesis, it functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis. However, in advanced stages, the overexpression or constitutive activation of TGFBR1 can facilitate cancer progression by promoting epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, metastasis, and immune evasion [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]. This duality has been documented in various malignancies, including breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and liver cancers. Given its role in cancer, TGFBR1 is a therapeutic target, particularly in tumors where TGF-β signaling promotes metastasis and immunosuppression [ 23 ]. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns of activin, inhibin, and their receptor (TGFBR1) transcripts in various organs of H. scabra , including the intestine, respiratory tree, ovary, testis, and the inner body wall, using In situ hybridization. Structural analyses provided additional evidence for the conservation of TGF-β receptors between H. scabra and Homo sapiens , particularly in regions critical for ligand and receptor interactions. To explore the potential functions of these proteins in humans, we conducted molecular docking analysis to predict their binding affinity with human TGF-β receptors. This approach helped identify possible cross-species functional similarities. Our findings may contribute to a deeper understanding of TGF-β signaling in marine invertebrates and highlight the biomedical significance of bioactive compounds derived from H. scabra . 2. Results 2.1. In Situ Hybridization of H. scabra Activin and Inhibin In situ hybridization technique was performed to investigate the localization of activin and inhibin mRNA in the intestine, respiratory tree, testis, ovary, and inner body wall of H. scabra [ 24 ]. The signals were visualized as distinct blue staining, indicating the sites of mRNA expression. In the intestine, blue staining was prominently observed in epithelial lining of the intestine and respiratory tree. These mRNAs were also detected in the coelomic epithelium and connective tissue of intestine. In the reproductive organs, activin and inhibin localization were found in the spermatocytes of testis and oocytes of ovary. Finally, in the inner wall, blue staining was observed within specific cells and connective tissues ( Figure 1 A,B). 2.2. Characterization and Expression of H. scabra TGF-β Receptor (HolscTGFBR) The full-length nucleotide sequence of Holsc TGFBR, comprising 1850 bp, was successfully amplified, validated, and made available in NCBI with accession number PV173756 ( Supplemental Data S1 ). It encodes a protein of 381 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of approximately 43.2 kDa ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, for the specific localization of the TGF receptors in the target organs, we found that the Holsc TGFBR mRNA was exclusively expressed in the intestinal epithelium, spermatocytes of the testis, oocytes of the ovary, and cells in the inner wall of the H. scabra ( Figure 3 A). The expression of Holsc TGFBR was analyzed in the selected tissues using RT–PCR, which produced an amplicon of approximately 207 bp ( Figure 3 C). The results demonstrated that the Holsc TGFBR transcript was widely expressed in the intestine, ovary, testis, and inner body wall, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological processes within these organs. In contrast, the expression of Holsc TGFBR was not detected in the respiratory tree, radial nerve cord, and nerve ring ( Figure 3 C). The specificity of the RT-PCR assay was validated by the absence of amplification in the non-template (negative) control. Additionally, the expression of 16S rRNA was used as a housekeeping gene to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the observed gene expression profiles. 2.3. Bioinformatic Analysis: Amino Acid Sequencing Alignment, Phylogenetic Tree, and Structural Analysis of H. scabra TGF-β Receptor A phylogenetic analysis of Holsc TGFBR compared with the TGF-β receptor I proteins from various species provided valuable insights into its evolutionary relationships and divergence. The analysis demonstrated that Holsc TGFBR was closely related to the TGF-β receptors of Apostichopus japonicus ( Apoja TGFBR), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ( Strpu TGFBR), Acanthaster planci ( Acapl TGFBR), and Patiria miniata ( Patmi TGFBR), indicating a conserved functional role of this receptor within the echinoderm phylum. Notably, Holsc TGFBR also exhibited significant similarity to the human TGF-β receptor ( Homsa TGFBR), suggesting a potential evolutionary link that extends across distant taxa ( Figure 4 ). Sequence alignment revealed a 66.4% identity between Holsc TGFBR and Homsa TGFBR. Several highly conserved regions were identified, including the GS loop (residues 185–194 in Homsa TGFBR and 63–72 in Holsc TGFBR), the αGS2 region (195–204 in Homsa TGFBR and 73–82 in Holsc TGFBR), the phosphate-binding loop (211–217 in Homsa TGFBR and 88–94 in Holsc TGFBR), the catalytic segment (331–351 in Homsa TGFBR and 209–229 in Holsc TGFBR), and the activation region (354–375 in Homsa TGFBR and 232–253 in Holsc TGFBR) ( Figure 5 A). Furthermore, the three-dimensional structure of Holsc TGFBR was predicted using the human Type I TGF-β receptor (PDB ID: 1b6c.3.B) as a structural template. A comparative structural analysis confirmed that key functional domains are conserved and exhibit high structural alignment. These findings support the functional significance of Holsc TGFBR in mediating TGF-β receptor activation and inhibition ( Figure 5 B–D) [ 25 , 26 ]. 2.4. Three-Dimensional Structural Modeling of H. scabra Activin and Inhibin Proteins Three-dimensional structural models of H. scabra activin and inhibin ( Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin) were generated using AlphaFold [ 27 ]. The results showed the predicted structures with pLDDT confidence scores of 69.6 ( Holsc Activin) and 70.1 ( Holsc Inhibin) and the predicted template modeling (pTM) scores of 0.685 and 0.464, respectively. To assess the structural precision and sequence similarity relative to experimentally determined structures, SWISS-MODEL was employed for comparative analyses. The templates with the highest sequence similarity were identified as Homsa GDF8 (human pro-myostatin precursor; 2.6 Å resolution; PDB ID: 5ntu.1.A) for Holsc Activin and Homsa TGFβ (human pro-TGF-β1; PDB ID: 5vqp.1.A) for Holsc Inhibin [ 28 , 29 ]. The structural superposition of the monomeric growth factor domains of Homsa GDF8 and Holsc Activin is illustrated in Figure 6 A. In this comparison, Homsa GDF8 is depicted with a gray ribbon (pro-domain) and a green ribbon (mature domain), while Holsc Activin is illustrated with a pale pink ribbon (pro-domain) and a deep pink ribbon (mature domain). The mature domain of Holsc Activin aligns closely with Homsa GDF8, preserving the canonical cystine knot fold, critical for receptor binding and signaling. The pro-domain structures exhibit moderate overlap, including subdomains such as the forearm, latency lasso, and arm regions, suggesting conserved latency control architecture despite evolutionary divergence. Sequence analysis indicates an amino acid identity of 30.43% between Homsa GDF8 and Holsc Activin, reflecting moderate conservation, typical of TGF-β family orthologs across metazoans. Additionally, cysteine residues essential for disulfide bond formation are strictly conserved, ensuring the correct stability of the tertiary structure. The red triangle in Figure 6 B indicates the N-terminal start site of the Holsc Activin mature domain (S316–F430), showing slight positional variation within the structure. Moreover, mature Holsc Activin monomer consists of 114 amino acids and forms homodimers with a molecular mass of approximately 25.7 kDa. Figure 6 C presents the structural superposition of Homsa TGFβ (depicted in pale blue for the pro-domain and deep blue for the mature domain) with Holsc Inhibin (tan for the pro-domain and orange for the mature domain). The mature domain of Holsc Inhibin aligns well with that of Homsa TGFβ, maintaining the characteristic β-strand and α-helix arrangements of TGF-β family growth factors [ 30 , 31 , 32 ]. However, notable structural differences are observed in the pro-domain, particularly within the latency lasso and arm regions, indicating species-specific adaptations that may influence latency mechanisms. Sequence alignment reveals an amino acid identity of 28.32% between Homsa TGFβ and Holsc Inhibin. The mature domain of Holsc Inhibin spans from V258 to Y371, consisting of 114 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 25.3 kDa for homodimers. Furthermore, the cysteine residues crucial for cystine knot motif formation are conserved, ensuring structural integrity ( Figure 6 D). 2.5. Molecular Docking of H. scabra TGF-β Proteins and TGF-β Receptors To investigate the potential role of H. scabra TGF-β ligands ( Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin) in signaling through the H. scabra type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor ( Holsc TGFBR), molecular docking analyses were performed. The complex with the highest coefficient-weighted score, representing the most stable binding interaction, was selected ( Table 1 ). The docking complexes of Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin with Holsc TGFBR, using human TGFBR structure (PDB ID: 1b6c.3.B) as a template, are shown in Figure 7 A,B. Holsc Activin (depicted as a deep pink ribbon) interacts with the extracellular domain of Holsc TGFBR (light blue ribbon), forming multiple stabilizing interactions. Hydrogen bonding interactions (yellow dotted lines) are observed between key Holsc Activin residues, including H368, G371, S370, R379, F330, T397, C428, and Q378, and receptor residues such as R77, R81, E117, R118, E125, N145, D244, I245, and Q247. The mapping of the interaction interface (middle panel) reveals direct contact residues forming both polar and hydrophobic interactions, underscoring their contribution to binding affinity and complex stabilization. Importantly, Holsc Activin did not bind to the key functional regions of Holsc TGFBR, including the serine/threonine-rich GS loop (residues 63EGTGSGSGLP72), the αC-helix of the kinase domain involved in structural stabilization, the active site residue E123, and the critical ATP-binding activation segment residue R250, which are essential for receptor activation and signal transduction ( Figure 7 A) [ 26 , 29 ]. In Figure 7 B, the Holsc Inhibin– Holsc TGFBR complex is shown, where Holsc Inhibin (orange ribbon) binds the receptor (light blue ribbon) at an overlapping but slightly shifted site compared to Holsc Activin. Hydrogen bonding interactions are identified between Holsc Inhibin residues L332, V338, K340, N349, K358, S350, E356, Y371, and receptor residues, including E58, K62, T65, S67, G66, S69, R77, N145, E125, R235, and D244. The critical interaction is that K340 and V338 of Holsc Inhibin bind to T65, G66, S67, and S69, which are in the serine/threonine-rich GS loop ( Figure 7 B). This interaction may physically block the access of the type II receptor kinase (TβRII) and prevent phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting the receptor activation [ 25 , 33 ]. Similarly, in humans, inhibin functions as a natural antagonist that prevents activin from binding to and activating TGF-β receptors, specifically TGFBR1 [ 26 ]. 2.6. Ternary Complex Docking Analysis of Human TGF-β1 and H. scabra TGF-β Ligands with Human TGFβ Receptors To analyze the sequence conservation and receptor-binding residues among human TGF-β1, Holsc Activin, and Holsc Inhibin, multiple sequence alignment was performed ( Figure 8 A). The results reveal that all three proteins retain conserved cysteine residues essential for cystine knot motif formation, which underpins tertiary structure stability and biological function, consistent with the structural requirements of TGF-β superfamily ligands. Residues highlighted in cyan and gray represent amino acids involved in hydrogen bonding with Homsa TGFBR2 and Homsa TGFBR1, respectively, as identified from structural docking analyses. For Homsa TGF-β1A, critical residues forming hydrogen bonds with TGFBR2 include W30, Y91, R94, and K97, consistent with previously reported receptor-binding interfaces [ 34 , 35 ]. The ternary complex of Homsa TGF-β1 (red), Homsa TGFBR2 (blue), and Homsa TGFBR1 (gray) was used as an experimental template. Docking analysis yielded a binding energy of −1054.2 kcal/mol ( Table 1 ). The complex forms multiple hydrogen bonds, including the residues R25, K31, H34, Y91, G93, R94, and R95 of the TGF-β1A interacting with D32, S49, E55, D118, and E119 of TGFBR2. The residues C78 and P80 of TGF-β1A also form hydrogen bonds with D57 and R58 of TGFBR1. Additionally, interactions involved F24, Q26, E59, and D118 of TGFBR2 binding to T18, K19, and D20 of TGFBR1. A central hydrophobic interface was identified, comprising residues I22, L28, W30, W32, A41, F43, V92, and M104 on TGF-β1, which engage hydrophobic patches on TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 ( Figure 8 B). This hydrophobic core contributes to stable receptor bridging and activation. The Holsc Activin ligand (warm pink ribbon) formed a ternary complex with Homsa TGFBR2 and Homsa TGFBR1, exhibiting a docking energy of −930.5 kcal/mol. Holsc Activin residues W341, Q378, D409, P419, and E420 form hydrogen bonds with F35, A21, N68, D69, E70, and N71 of TGFBR2. Residues R356, S362, E377, R379, G387, and E391 interact with C14, H15, T18, T35, D39, K40, H43, and F60 of TGFBR1. Additionally, interactions include V22, K29, S116, D118, E119, and N123 of TGFBR2 binding to C17, K19, D20, D27, A49, and D52 of TGFBR1. Hydrophobic residues, including F406, W343, M399, F354, F430, F372, I388, L361, and I375, form significant interfacial contacts with TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 ( Figure 8 C), stabilizing the complex despite weaker binding energy compared to endogenous TGF-β1. The Holsc Inhibin ligand (orange ribbon) forms a stable ternary complex with a docking energy of −1002.3 kcal/mol, comparable to endogenous TGF-β1. Hydrogen bonding interactions involve the N330, K340, R351, and K358 residues of Holsc Inhibin forming bonds with D32, V33, T51, S52, R66, N68, N71, T73, and D118 of TGFBR2. Moreover, the ligand residues C229, Q300, N314, C335, and A337 bind with T35, D39, and T73 of TGFBR1. The inter-receptor contacts include K23, P25, K97, S117, D118, and E119 of TGFBR2 binding to K40, I42, S33, N44, D52, and T72 of TGFBR1. Extensive hydrophobic contacts are observed with residues W287, W285, M319, L332, M331, L363, and F348, enhancing complex stability and receptor occupancy ( Figure 8 D). ijms-26-06998-t001_Table 1 Table 1 The highest coefficient weight scores from PIPER energy calculations were obtained for the complexes of human and H. scabra TGF-β ligands with their respective TGFBR receptors, following docking analysis using ClusPro 2.0.

E DARS reveals the pairwise structure-based potential constructed using the decoys as the reference state (DARS) method [ 36 ]. 3. Discussion This study is the first to investigate the localization, sequence conservation, structural alignment, and potential functional roles of H. scabra TGF-β proteins (activin and inhibin) across various organs, including the intestine, respiratory tree, ovary, testis, and inner body wall [ 5 , 24 ]. Additionally, we examined the specific gene expression and localization of the H. scabra TGF-β receptor. A comparative sequence alignment was also conducted between H. scabra TGF-β receptors and those of multiple species, particularly Homo sapiens . Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to assess the relevance of H. scabra TGF-β proteins in binding adaptively to the human TGF-β receptor. These findings provided fundamental insights into the potential biomedical applications of H. scabra -derived proteins [ 2 , 29 , 37 , 38 ]. For specific localization investigation, the in situ hybridization results indicated that the H. scabra TGF-β genes, including activin and inhibin, were localized across all targeted organs. In the intestine, the mRNA for activin and inhibin were prominently observed in the epithelial layer, aligning with their roles in nutrient absorption and digestion [ 39 ]. In the respiratory tree, signals were detected in the lining of the respiratory tubules, suggesting a possible role in gas exchange or osmoregulation [ 40 ]. In the testis, intense signals were localized to somatic cells surrounding the germinal epithelium, indicating a regulatory role in spermatogenesis. Similarly, signals were concentrated in the follicular layer surrounding developing oocytes, implying involvement in oocyte maturation [ 41 , 42 ]. Notably, the TGF-β genes were expressed in the inner wall, suggesting their presence in connective tissue and specific cells, which may imply a role in extracellular matrix remodeling, structural integrity, and repair processes [ 43 , 44 ]. These observations are consistent with the known functions of TGF-β family members in cellular communication, matrix control, and tissue homeostasis [ 45 ]. Consequently, the findings suggest that activin and inhibin may play a potential role in extracellular matrix remodeling and maintaining structural integrity [ 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Interestingly, the H. scabra TGF-β receptor ( Holsc TGFBR) expression exhibited high sequence identity with the human TGF-β receptor type I, which is involved in signal transduction [ 25 ]. The tissue-specific expression pattern of Holsc TGFBR indicated its functional significance in important physiological processes. Its exclusive expression in the intestinal epithelium, spermatocytes, oocytes, and inner body wall implies potential roles in digestion, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, in line with the roles of TGF-β signaling in invertebrate development and homeostasis [ 49 ]. The widespread expression of Holsc TGFBR in reproductive and digestive tissues was confirmed by RT-PCR. The absence of expression in neural tissues, such as the radial nerve cord and nerve ring, suggests a tissue-specific regulatory role rather than direct involvement in neural signaling. These findings highlight Holsc TGFBR as a key regulator in H. scabra physiology, warranting further investigation into its downstream signaling pathways and functional implications [ 50 ]. The phylogenetic and structural analyses of Holsc TGFBR underscore its evolutionary conservation and potential functional significance. Phylogenetic comparisons show a close relationship between Holsc TGFBR and TGF-β receptor homologs in other echinoderms. This similarity suggests a conserved role in fundamental biological processes, such as development, regeneration, and immune regulation, consistent with the TGF-β signaling functions in marine invertebrates [ 51 ]. Remarkably, Holsc TGFBR exhibits significant sequence similarity to the human TGF-β type I receptor ( Homsa TGFBR), particularly in key functional regions like the GS loop, αGS regions, phosphate-binding loop, catalytic segment, and activation region. This conservation implies that Holsc TGFBR likely employs similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms for receptor activation as observed in vertebrates. The preserved catalytic segment and phosphate-binding loop further support its potential kinase activity in signal transduction [ 52 ]. We investigated the structural conservation and receptor-binding potential of two H. scabra TGF-β superfamily ligands, Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin, to assess their functional parallels with vertebrate TGF-β family members. AlphaFold modeling indicated moderate confidence, with both proteins displaying overall structural similarity to canonical TGF-β templates. SWISS-MODEL analyses identified Homsa GDF8 (pro-myostatin precursor) as the closest homolog for Holsc Activin and Homsa TGFβ1 for Holsc Inhibin, consistent with expected divergence across metazoan orthologs. Importantly, both Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin retained all cysteine residues necessary for cystine knot motif formation, ensuring correct folding and structural stability [ 35 , 53 ]. Structural superposition showed that mature Holsc Activin aligned closely with Homsa GDF8, preserving the canonical cysteine knot fold critical for receptor binding. Holsc Inhibin similarly maintained the β-strand and α-helix arrangements characteristic of mature Homsa TGFβ. While their mature domains were well conserved, notable species-specific differences were observed in pro-domain regions, particularly in Holsc Inhibin. These included variations within the forearm, latency lasso, and arm subdomains, which regulate ligand latency and activation mechanisms, suggesting evolutionary adaptations that may influence receptor affinity or signaling dynamics [ 34 , 54 , 55 ]. These findings indicate that Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin share conserved structural features with vertebrate TGF-β family ligands, supporting their potential roles in H. scabra cellular regulation, including growth, differentiation, and immune responses [ 53 , 56 ]. For molecular docking, we investigated the molecular interactions of Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin with their putative receptor ( Holsc TGFBR) to evaluate their potential signaling and inhibitory properties within the TGF-β superfamily framework. Holsc Activin docked onto Holsc TGFBR, forming multiple hydrogen bonds with the receptor residues, including R77, E117, and R118, and stabilizing hydrophobic contacts while avoiding critical catalytic regions, activation segments, and the GS loop. This indicated that Holsc Activin may function similarly to endogenous activin ligands as well as activating TGF-β signaling [ 57 , 58 ]. Conversely, Holsc Inhibin showed binding to receptor regions overlapping with Holsc Activin but critically engaged the serine/threonine-rich GS loop through K340 and V338 residues interacting with T65, G66, S67, and S69. Such interactions could physically obstruct type II receptor recruitment and block receptor activation, consistent with the established inhibitory mechanism of vertebrate inhibins, which prevent activin-induced signaling by sequestering receptor sites [ 38 ]. A balance between these ligands controls cell proliferation and differentiation and plays an important role in normal development and homeostasis [ 59 , 60 ]. Furthermore, we concentrated on these TGF-β proteins from the inner wall, as they possess the potential to be developed into functional food and medical applications [ 25 , 55 ]. Interestingly, cross-species docking analysis further provided insights into potential functional conservation between H. scabra and human TGF-β proteins. Ternary complex docking with human receptors ( Homsa TGFBR1 and Homsa TGFBR2) further elucidated the competitive binding potential of Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin. The crystal structure of the Homsa TGF–β1– Homsa TGFBR2– Homsa TGFBR1 ternary complex (PDB ID: 3KFD) served as a template, enabling the structural modeling to predict their ability to mimic endogenous TGF-β ligand binding and receptor activation [ 34 ]. Molecular docking analysis revealed distinct roles of H. scabra TGF-β proteins in receptor activation and inhibition. Ternary complex docking with human TGF-β receptors further supported these interpretations. Endogenous human TGF-β1 exhibited the strongest binding energy (−1054.2 kcal/mol) with extensive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions bridging TGFBR2 and TGFBR1, consistent with its potent activation capability [ 37 ]. Importantly, the complete complex exhibited both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions at regions and specific residues consistent with those in the experimental crystal structure [ 34 ]. This approach can therefore be applied to Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin for cross-species docking analyses, providing further insights into the potential function of H. scabra proteins. Holsc Activin showed moderate binding (−930.5 kcal/mol), forming multiple interfacial interactions yet lacking the extensive hydrophobic core stabilizing endogenous TGF-β1, suggesting partial receptor engagement. In contrast, Holsc Inhibin displayed a docking energy (−1002.3 kcal/mol) approaching that of TGF-β1, forming robust inter-receptor contacts and occupying the receptor interface in a manner indicative of competitive inhibition without activation. These results suggested that these ligands can mimic endogenous TGF-β binding modes and potentially modulate receptor-mediated signal transduction [ 35 , 37 ]. In short, we predicted the functional conservation of H. scabra TGF-β proteins, with Holsc Activin functioning as a potential agonist and Holsc Inhibin serving as an antagonist of activin signaling in human TGF-β receptor responses [ 59 , 60 ]. These findings will lead to medical application investigations utilizing H. scabra as a naturally functioning resource. Nonetheless, further studies are required to assess their efficacy, safety, and interactions with human receptors and signaling pathways [ 61 ]. Additionally, incorporating these proteins into nanoparticle-based or other targeted delivery systems may enhance their therapeutic potential. This research supports the broader pursuit of nature-sourced approaches for novel functional food as well as biomedical applications in the future [ 62 , 63 ]. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Ethics Statement All animals involved in this experiment were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Thammasat University (Protocol Number 019/2561) according to the established guidelines for scientific research. In this study, we aimed to investigate the distribution of transforming growth factor superfamily (TGF-β), including activin and inhibin, in H. scabra . Wild specimens (weighing 300–500 g, with random sexes) were collected from Krabi Province, Thailand, following Songkoomkrong et al., 2024 [ 4 ]. Subsequently, tissue samples of H. scabra , including the intestine, respiratory tree, gonads, and inner wall, were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The frozen samples were kept at −80 °C for later RNA extraction, while the fixed samples were processed for histological examination and in situ hybridization [ 64 ]. 4.2. In Situ Hybridization of the Activin, Inhibin, and TGF-β Receptor Type I in H. scraba The DIG-labeled sense and anti-sense RNA probes for activin and inhibin were derived from the study by Kornthong et al., 2021 [ 6 , 20 ]. Tissue slides of all organs were routinely prepared using the paraffin method. Following de-paraffinization and rehydration, the slides were immersed in PBS containing DEPC, followed by PBS with 0.3% Tween-20 (PBST), and then incubated with Proteinase K (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in 1× TNE buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The slides were washed with 2X Sodium Saline Citrate (SSC) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For the hybridization procedure, the tissues were incubated in the hybridization solution with RNA probes for Holsc Activin, Holsc Inhibin, and TGF-β receptor type I ( Holsc TGFBR) overnight at 52 °C. Afterward, the slides were thoroughly washed with 4×, 2×, and 1× SSC solution and blocked for non-specific binding with maleic acid buffer containing 2% sheep serum at room temperature for 3–4 h. The slides were then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the tissue slides were stained using the NBT/BCIP detection system. Positive expression sites of activin and inhibin were examined and photographed using a Leica compound microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The complete hybridization procedure followed the methodology described by Kornthong et al., 2021 [ 6 ]. 4.3. Bioinformatic Analysis of Activin, Inhibin, and TGF-β Receptor Type I in H. scraba and Other Echinoderms As a previous report, the transcriptome data set of growth factor transcripts in various organs of H. scabra is available in NCBI (Accession no: MW728942 to MW728950) [ 6 , 25 ]. The translational amino acid sequences of the Holsc Activin (accession no: MW728947), Holsc Inhibin (accession no: MW728945), and Holsc TGFBR (accession no: PV173756) were identified using BLASTx ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi , accessed on 28 April 2024). The molecular mass of mature proteins was calculated using the online software ExPASy Peptide Mass program ( http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/ , accessed on 30 April 2024). The analysis of multiple amino acid sequence alignments of Holsc TGFBR compared to other species was performed using MEGA11 software, utilizing MUSCLE for alignment. The conserved amino acids were generated with Multiple Align Show ( https://www.bioinformatics.org/SMS/multi_align.html , accessed on 3 May 2024). Phylogenetic tree analysis was conducted with MEGA11 software and modified by iTOL v6 software ( https://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi , accessed on 3 May 2024). 4.4. Tissue Distribution of the TGF-β Receptor Type I mRNA in H. scabra The collected tissue samples were extracted for total RNA extraction. The concentration and purity of each RNA sample were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm (ND-3800-OD Nano DOT Microspectrophotometer, Hercuvan Lab Systems, Brixton, UK) [ 65 ]. cDNA synthesis was then carried out using the QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the resulting cDNA served as a template for PCR with gene-specific primers, as shown in Table 2 . 4.5. Structural Modeling Prediction and Sequence Analysis Full-length sequences of Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin were obtained from previously published transcriptome data [ 6 ]. The three-dimensional structures of both proteins were utilized using AlphaFold2, accessible on https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb , accessed on 4 July 2025 [ 27 ]. The predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) was used to assess model confidence, while the predicted aligned error (PAE) estimated positional uncertainties for each amino acid. Modeling parameters included 20 recycles and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) tolerance of 0.5 Å. For single-chain predictions, ranking was based on pLDDT scores, whereas complex models were ranked by predicted TM-score. Five models were generated per run, and their respective pTM and pLDDT scores were recorded. Additional structural features were retrieved using SWISS-MODEL ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ , accessed on 5 July 2025). After predicting the 3D structures, Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin were analyzed and structurally aligned using the crystal structures of the closest human homologs as templates, including Homsa GDF8 (human pro-myostatin precursor; 2.6 Å resolution, PDB ID: 5ntu.1.A) for Holsc Activin and Homsa TGFβ (human pro-TGF-β1, PDB ID: 5vqp.1.A) for Holsc Inhibin. Additionally, the 3D structure of Holsc TGFBR was generated by using the SWISS-MODEL, accessed on 15 May 2024, using Homsa TGFBR (PDB ID: 1b6c.3.B) as a template. Refinement and annotation were performed using Chimera UCSF software (version 1.6.1). 4.6. Molecular Docking Complex structures of Holsc Activin and Hols cInhibin with the Holsc TGFBR were docked using the cytoplasmic domain of the type I TGF-β receptor (PDB ID: 1b6c) as a complex structural template. For ternary complex docking, Homsa TGFβ was initially docked with Homsa TGFBR2. The complexes with the most favorable (lowest) energy scores were selected, and Homsa TGFBR1 was subsequently recruited to form the complete ternary complex. The crystal structure of the ternary complex (PDB ID: 3KFD) was used as the experimental template. This protocol was similarly applied using Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin in place of Homsa TGFβ. All molecular docking complexes were performed on ClusPro 2.0, a widely recognized server for protein–protein docking ( https://cluspro.org/help.php , accessed on 6 July 2025). The interaction energy of the protein complexes is based on the PIPER protein interaction energy, using the equation E = w 1 E rep + w 2 E attr + w 3 E elec + w 4 E DARS . The PIPER algorithm has demonstrated strong performance in CAPRI assessments, calculating docking energies on a grid using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and pairwise interaction potentials, which enables the rapid identification of near-native conformations [ 36 ]. The resulting structures were then clustered based on pairwise RMSD to optimize their representation as follows [ 4 , 66 ]. The top-ranked models were subsequently visualized using PyMol. 5. Conclusions The expression of Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin was observed across all targeted tissues in the gene expression analysis and in situ hybridization. In the intestine and respiratory tree, these genes were identified in the intestinal and coelomic epithelium, connective tissues, and epithelial cells. Both genes were also present in spermatocytes within the testis and in oocytes of the ovary. Furthermore, their localization was specific to the connective tissue cells and fibers of the inner body wall. Holsc TGFBR exhibited a similar expression pattern, except for its absence in the respiratory tree. Phylogenetic and structural analyses revealed that Holsc TGFBR is evolutionarily conserved, sharing similarities with human TGF-β receptors. The presence of conserved sequence motifs and structural domains supports the functional significance of Holsc TGFBR in TGF-β signaling. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that Holsc Activin binds to Holsc TGFBR, potentially functioning as an agonist, whereas Holsc Inhibin likely inhibits receptor activation. The ternary complex interactions suggested a strong role for Holsc Inhibin and Holsc Activin in competitive TGF-β signaling, potentially contributing to tumor suppression and immune response enhancement. These findings illuminate the conserved and distinct mechanisms between H. scabra and human TGF-β signaling. Such insights have significant implications for health-related applications and the development of functional foods in the future.

  "plain_text": "Holothuria scabra has long been acknowledged in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily is crucial in regulating cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and immune responses. This study marks the first exploration of the gene expression localization, sequence conservation, and functional roles of H. scabra TGF-β proteins, specifically activin ( Holsc Activin), inhibin ( Holsc Inhibin), and the TGF-β receptor ( Holsc TGFBR), across various organs. In situ hybridization indicated that Holsc Activin and Holsc Inhibin are expressed in the intestine, respiratory tree, ovary, testis, and inner body wall. This suggests their roles in nutrient absorption, gas exchange, reproduction, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Notably, Holsc TGFBR demonstrated a similar tissue-specific expression pattern, except for its absence in the respiratory tree. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that Holsc TGFBR shares significant sequence similarity with Homsa TGFBR, especially in regions essential for signal transduction and inhibition. Molecular docking results indicate that Holsc Activin may promote receptor activation, while Holsc Inhibin functions as a natural antagonist, reflecting the signaling mechanisms of human TGF-β proteins. Interestingly, cross-species ternary complex docking with human TGF-β receptors further supports these findings, showing that Holsc Activin moderately engages the receptors, whereas Holsc Inhibin exhibits strong binding, suggestive of competitive inhibition. These results indicate that H. scabra TGF-β proteins retain the structural and functional features of vertebrate TGF-β ligands, supporting their potential applications as natural modulators in therapeutic and functional food development."
