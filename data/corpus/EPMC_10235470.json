  "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) exerts pleiotropic effects on mammalian cells via stimulation of its receptor (IGF-IR), a receptor tyrosine kinase. In vivo, IGF-I acts both as a local tissue growth factor and as a circulating hormone. In oncological research, IGF-I has received increased attention as the activated IGF-I/IGF-IR system displays mitogeneic, transforming, and anti-apoptotic properties in various cell types by stimulating distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Recent data suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I may mediate decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in vivo. Thus, targeting the IGF-I/IGF-IR system could serve as an approach to overcome clinical drug resistance in certain tumors.",
