Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as key modulators of gene expression and cellular processes, playing pivotal roles in cancer biology. In breast cancer, a multifaceted malignancy driven by diverse genetic and epigenetic alterations, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is critical for regulating processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Emerging research highlights intricate interactions between lncRNAs and MAPK signaling components, including ERK, p38, and JNK, revealing novel regulatory mechanisms underlying breast cancer development and progression. These interactions often involve lncRNAs modulating MAPK pathway activity or engaging in crosstalk with other oncogenic networks. This review explores how lncRNAs influence MAPK signaling in breast cancer pathogenesis, emphasizing their dual roles as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the molecular context. While these findings suggest that lncRNAs could serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to influence tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance, challenges such as study heterogeneity, conflicting functional outcomes, and the complexity of lncRNA-MAPK interactions limit immediate clinical translation. By elucidating these molecular relationships, we aim to provide insights into breast cancer biology and highlight the potential, as well as the limitations, of leveraging lncRNA-MAPK interactions for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, pending further mechanistic and clinical validation. Graphical abstract Highlights This review elucidates the intricate interplay between lncRNAs and the MAPK signaling pathways in breast cancer pathogenesis. It highlights the roles of lncRNAs in modulating key MAPK components, including ERK, p38, and JNK, thereby influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and therapy resistance. The dualistic nature of lncRNAs as oncogenes or tumor suppressors is explored, with emphasis on their context-dependent regulatory mechanisms. The therapeutic potential of targeting lncRNA-MAPK interactions is underscored, particularly for aggressive and treatment-resistant breast cancer subtypes. This study positions lncRNAs as promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, advancing our understanding of breast cancer biology and paving the way for innovative clinical interventions. Keywords LncRNAs MAPK Breast cancer P38 ERK issue-copyright-statement \u00a9 BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Breast cancer remains a leading global health challenge, characterized by its complex molecular landscape and significant clinical heterogeneity. According to the GLOBOCAN 2022 estimates, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in females, with approximately 2.30 million new cases and 670,000 deaths worldwide in 2022, underscoring its substantial global burden [ 1 ]. As one of the most prevalent malignancies among women, it is driven by diverse genetic and epigenetic alterations that influence tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance [ 2 , 3 ]. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, aggressive subtypes, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), continue to pose significant obstacles due to their high recurrence rates and limited therapeutic options [ 4 \u2013 6 ]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer pathogenesis to identify novel therapeutic targets [ 7 ]. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, encompassing extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAPKs, are pivotal regulators of cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and stress responses [ 8 ]. Dysregulation of these pathways is frequently implicated in breast cancer, contributing to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance [ 9 ]. For instance, aberrant ERK activation is associated with enhanced proliferation in HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes, while p38 and JNK can exert both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects depending on the cellular context [ 10 ]. Understanding the regulatory networks that modulate MAPK signaling is therefore critical for developing targeted interventions. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides without protein-coding capacity, have emerged as key regulators of gene expression and cellular function in cancer [ 11 , 12 ]. Functionally, lncRNAs act as molecular scaffolds, decoys, or competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), modulating gene expression through chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, or post-transcriptional interactions [ 13 , 14 ]. In breast cancer, lncRNAs influence critical processes such as proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance by interacting with oncogenic or tumor-suppressive pathways, including MAPK signaling [ 15 ]. For example, lncRNAs like LINC00511 and PRNCR1 have been shown to modulate p38 and ERK pathways, promoting tumor progression, while others, such as PTENP1, exert tumor-suppressive effects by inhibiting MAPK activity [ 16 , 17 ]. This review aims to elucidate the intricate interplay between lncRNAs and MAPK signaling pathways in breast cancer pathogenesis. By exploring how lncRNAs regulate the ERK, p38, and JNK pathways, we seek to uncover novel molecular mechanisms driving tumor development and highlight the potential of lncRNA-MAPK interactions as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The following sections provide a detailed examination of lncRNAs, MAPK signaling components, and their specific roles in breast cancer, emphasizing their context-dependent functions and clinical implications. LncRNAs Numerous RNA molecules with protein-coding capacity or lack of protein-coding capacity are transcribed from the human genome [ 11 ]. The non-coding RNA molecules are classified into numerous categories; among them, microRNAs (miRNAs) and lncRNAs are well-studied and well-known. In this context, lncRNAs have attracted a huge amount of attention among researchers as genome by-products that are crucial to various vital and fate-determining events [ 18 , 19 ]. lncRNAs with more than 200 bp length cannot be translated into functional proteins, which is due to lack of open reading frame in their genome [ 20 , 21 ]. Using high-throughput sequencing and genome tiling arrays, the number of identified lncRNAs (approximately 100,000 human types to date) with diverse structures and functions is increasing daily [ 22 , 23 ]. Similarly to coding genes, RNA polymerase II governs the transcriptional process of lncRNAs [ 13 ]. They are generally spliced via spliceosomes and have poly A tails. Five categories have been considered for the lncRNAs based on the genomic location: [ 1 ] long intronic ncRNAs, in which the transcripts of lncRNAs are located into intronic region of genes; [ 2 ] enhancer RNAs, promoter-related transcripts, and divergent transcripts, in which lncRNAs are transcribed in both antisense and sense directions; [ 3 ] pseudogenes, in which transcripts of lncRNAs are mutated and lack any capability for protein-coding; [ 4 ] antisense transcripts, in which lncRNA transcripts are located on the opposite strand of genes; [ 5 ] stand-alone lncRNAs, in which lncRNAs locations are away from protein-coding genes [ 24 ]. From the functional point of view, lncRNAs are classified into five categories. The first category is lncRNAs that recruit and interact with the protein. The example for this category is HOTAIR, which, by interacting with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), regulates the expression of the homeobox D cluster (HOXD) gene [ 25 ]. The second category consists of lncRNAs that act as decoys. For example, for downregulating the expression levels of pro-apoptotic mediators, lncRNA PANDA functions as a decoy for nuclear transcription factor Y subunit A (NF-YA) [ 26 ]. In the third category, lncRNAs serve as a co-repressor or co-regulator. lncRNA SRA is an example of this category, which acts as a co-activator for nuclear steroid receptors [ 27 , 28 ]. miRNAs-interacting lncRNAs such as HOTAIR, which interacts with miR-331-3p and regulates the expression levels of HER2, are the fourth category [ 29 ]. And at the last category, lncRNAs act as host genes for miRNAs, like H19 [ 30 ]. MAPK pathways MAPK pathways are essential signaling pathways in regulating a broad range of cellular events, which consist of three significant kinases, including MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK [ 8 ]. The first kinase is located on the top of the signaling, which is activated upon to exposure to various intracellular and extracellular stimuli, and then phosphorylates and activates MAPKK [ 31 ]. This kinase, in turn, initiates the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK, which has various targets, most of which are involved in determining cell fate [ 32 ]. MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates is accompanied by suppression of upstream activators [ 33 ]. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , MAPK signaling is stimulated by numerous stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, as physiological cues, as well as environmental signals and endogenous stress. These stimuli initiate signaling through membrane-bound receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein-coupled receptors, which trigger a three-tiered kinase module involving MAP3Ks (e.g., C-Raf, MEKKs, ASK, TAK1), MAP2Ks (e.g., MKK1/2, MKK3/6, MKK4/7), and MAPKs (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK1-3, p38\u03b1-\u03b4). These cascades ultimately phosphorylate transcription factors that regulate critical cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis, all of which are pivotal in breast cancer pathogenesis [ 34 , 35 ]. Therefore, traditionally, MAPKs are categorized into two classes: mitogen-activated MAPKs, ERK, and stress-activated MAPKs, JNK, and p38. From the physiological point of view, this distinction is ambiguous, and all three families respond to numerous signals [ 34 ]. The MAPK signaling pathway is frequently implicated in the mutations observed in several diseases, including cancer, which makes it a hot point of research in developing drugs [ 8 ]. p38 p38 Signaling pathway The p38 MAPK signaling pathway is instrumental in the cellular adaptation process in response to environmental stresses, cytokines, and growth factors. The pathway consists of four isoforms: p38\u03b1, p38\u03b2, p38\u03b3, and p38\u03b4, encoded by the genes MAPK14, MAPK11, MAPK12, and MAPK13, respectively [ 36 ]. Among these, p38\u03b1 is ubiquitously expressed and serves as a central regulator of cellular processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation, while the other isoforms exhibit tissue-specific expression. For example, p38\u03b2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, p38\u03b3 in skeletal muscles, and p38\u03b4 in the liver, pancreas, and testes [ 37 ]. Extracellular stimuli, including oxidative stress, UV radiation, heat shock, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1, activate the pathway. Activation begins with upstream MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks), such as TAK1, and signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which phosphorylate MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), such as MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. These kinases subsequently phosphorylate p38 on threonine and tyrosine residues within its activation loop, specifically at Thr180 and Tyr182 [ 38 ]. This dual phosphorylation activates p38, enabling it to regulate diverse downstream targets, including transcription factors (e.g., ATF2, STAT3), protein kinases (e.g., MK2), and other substrates in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Through these targets, p38 influences processes like cell cycle regulation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses. The pathway also exhibits a non-canonical activation mechanism, as seen in T cells, where ZAP70 phosphorylates p38 at Tyr3233 [ 39 ]. The flexibility and complexity of the p38 signaling cascade, with isoform-specific roles and interactions, highlight its critical importance in both normal cellular functions and pathological states, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. p38 Structure The four p38 isoforms share a highly conserved protein kinase domain, but subtle differences in their structure underlie functional diversity. Each isoform contains a characteristic TXY dual phosphorylation motif in the activation loop (Thr-Gly-Tyr in p38\u03b1, p38\u03b2, and p38\u03b4; Thr-Gly-Tyr in p38\u03b3). p38\u03b1, encoded by the MAPK14 gene on chromosome 6, comprises 360 amino acids and undergoes extensive post-translational modifications. These include phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182, acetylation at Lys53 and Lys152, and ubiquitination at multiple lysine residues. These modifications regulate its kinase activity, stability, and substrate interactions. Isoforms like p38\u03b2 (364 amino acids) and p38\u03b3 (367 amino acids) exhibit similar structural domains but differ in expression patterns and functional roles [ 40 ]. For instance, p38\u03b2 is expressed predominantly in neuronal tissues, while p38\u03b3 is localized mainly in skeletal muscles [ 41 , 42 ]. p38\u03b4, encoded by MAPK13 on chromosome 6, is structurally akin to p38\u03b1 but is predominantly found in the pancreas, testes, and liver. It regulates specialized functions like cytoskeletal remodeling and protein translation. Tissue-specific splicing variants of these isoforms further add to the complexity of p38 functionality. For instance, MAPK14 encodes five isoforms, including a shorter variant implicated in early apoptosis\u200b [ 43 , 44 ]. The subcellular localization of p38 isoforms also varies, influencing their activity. While inactive p38 is primarily cytoplasmic, its activation prompts nuclear translocation, where it interacts with transcription factors to regulate gene expression [ 45 ]. p38 Regulation Regulation of p38 activity is tightly controlled through a dynamic interplay of activation and deactivation mechanisms, ensuring precise cellular responses to diverse stimuli. This regulation primarily involves upstream kinases, phosphatases, transcription factors, and scaffold proteins that modulate p38 signaling specificity and amplitude [ 37 ]. Deactivation of p38 is equally critical and is achieved through dephosphorylation by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), such as DUSP1 and DUSP16, which target the threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop [ 46 ]. Additionally, protein phosphatases like PP2C and PP2A contribute to p38 inactivation either directly or by dephosphorylating upstream MAP2Ks [ 47 ]. These phosphatases ensure that p38 activity is transient and tightly regulated to prevent excessive signaling. Transcription factors, including ATF2, YY1, and MEF2, play a pivotal role in mediating p38-dependent gene expression. These factors are phosphorylated by activated p38, leading to the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and cell cycle control. Scaffold proteins, such as JIP4 and OSM, enhance signaling specificity by organizing p38 and its upstream activators into signaling complexes, facilitating efficient signal transduction and enabling crosstalk with other MAPK pathways, such as JNK [ 48 \u2013 50 ]. The regulation of p38 is further influenced by scaffold proteins that localize signaling complexes and enable crosstalk with other MAPK pathways, such as JNK. These scaffolds fine-tune the specificity and amplitude of p38 signaling in response to diverse stimuli [ 51 ]. The precise regulation of p38 is critical, as its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, where isoform-specific roles can either promote or suppress tumorigenesis. For instance, p38\u03b1 supports both pro-apoptotic and survival pathways depending on the cellular context, while p38\u03b4 is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and metastasis [ 52 ]. These regulatory mechanisms highlight the complexity of p38 signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer, with further modulation by non-coding RNAs discussed in subsequent sections. ERK ERK signaling pathway Serving as a core element of the MAPK signaling cascade, ERK plays an integral role in cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, survival, and stress responses. The ERK signaling pathway is activated by various upstream signals, including growth factors, mitogens, and ROS [ 53 ]. These stimuli trigger RTKs, such as EGFR or insulin receptors, to form a complex with adaptor proteins like GRB2 and SOS. This interaction facilitates the activation of RAS by replacing GDP with GTP, converting RAS into its active GTP-bound form. Activated RAS recruits RAF kinases (e.g., ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF) to the plasma membrane, where phosphorylation events initiate the downstream cascade. RAF initiates the activation of MEK1/2, which then phosphorylates ERK1/2 at conserved threonine and tyrosine residues within the TEY motif. Once phosphorylated, ERK1/2 phosphorylates a wide array of substrates [ 54 ]. In the cytoplasm, ERK regulates proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, cell motility, vesicle trafficking, and metabolic processes. For example, ERK phosphorylation can enhance cell adhesion by modifying cytoskeletal proteins [ 55 , 56 ]. Translocation of ERK to the nucleus, facilitated by specific docking interactions, enables it to regulate transcription factors such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPS-II), involved in nucleotide biosynthesis, and p90RSK, which modulates cell cycle progression. This dynamic compartmentalization allows ERK to orchestrate precise cellular responses to stimuli\u200b [ 57 ]. ERK structure ERK exhibits a highly conserved structure within the MAP kinase family, reflecting its critical role in signal transduction. ERK contains a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe, with a catalytic cleft that binds MgATP, facilitating the transfer of phosphate groups. The N-terminal lobe contains a glycine-rich loop that stabilizes ATP, five \u03b2-sheets, and the \u03b1C-helix, which is crucial for ERK activation. The C-terminal lobe features conserved \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets, which contribute to stabilizing interactions with substrates and regulatory proteins. Activation of ERK requires phosphorylation of two residues within the TEY motif\u2014threonine and tyrosine. This dual phosphorylation induces conformational changes that align key residues, forming the active site. Structural motifs, including the regulatory and catalytic spines (R- and C-spines), play critical roles in ERK activation. The R-spine, comprising residues from the \u03b24-strand, activation loop, catalytic loop, and F-helix, stabilizes substrate binding, while the C-spine anchors ATP in the catalytic cleft for efficient phosphoryl transfer [ 58 \u2013 60 ]. ERK also contains specialized docking domains that strengthen interactions with upstream kinases, substrates, and scaffolding proteins. The D-site recruitment site, located on the backside of the catalytic cleft, interacts with positively charged residues on MEK1/2 and other proteins. The F-site recruitment site, composed of hydrophobic residues, binds proteins containing FXFP or FXF motifs [ 61 , 62 ]. These docking interactions enhance the specificity and efficiency of ERK-mediated phosphorylation events\u200b. ERK regulation The regulation of ERK activity is complex, involving positive and negative feedback mechanisms to ensure precise control over signaling dynamics. Positive regulation occurs through phosphorylation by MEK1/2, facilitated by scaffold proteins such as kinase suppressor of RAS (KSR). These scaffolds assemble the MAPK signaling complex, bringing MEK and ERK into proximity for efficient activation [ 59 ]. Negative regulation includes dephosphorylation by phosphatases such as DUSPs, which inactivate ERK by removing phosphate groups. Proteins like Sprouty and Spred act as inhibitors by disrupting interactions between upstream activators and ERK. Additionally, feedback loops modulate ERK activity; for example, ERK can phosphorylate MEK1, reducing its ability to activate ERK and thereby limiting signal propagation [ 63 , 64 ]. Aberrant regulation of the ERK pathway is widespread in cancer; often resulting from mutations in upstream components such as RAS or RAF. Targeting ERK directly has developed into a promising strategy to address resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors. Specific ERK inhibitors, including SCH772984 and ulixertinib, block ERK phosphorylation and kinase activity, effectively shutting down aberrant signaling. These inhibitors are currently under clinical investigation and have shown potential in treating cancers with dysregulated MAPK signaling [ 65 ]\u200b. By integrating these regulatory mechanisms and structural features, ERK ensures precise control over diverse cellular processes, making it both a central signaling hub and a critical target for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as cancer. JNK JNK signaling pathway JNKs, also called stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), are critical members of the MAPK family. JNKs respond to a variety of stimuli, such as cytokines, growth factors, oxidative stress, ultraviolet radiation, and toxins [ 66 ]. The pathway is structured as a three-tiered module involving MAP3Ks, MAP2Ks, and the JNKs themselves. MAP3Ks, such as the MEKK family and apoptosis ASK, activate MAP2Ks (MKK4 and MKK7), which then phosphorylate JNKs at threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 within a conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. Activated JNKs phosphorylate substrates, including transcription factors like activator protein-1 (AP-1), p53, and ATF-2, to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and inflammation [ 67 , 68 ]. JNK signaling is implicated in various cancers, emphasizing its dual role as both a tumor promoter and suppressor depending on cellular context\u200b [ 69 ]. For instance, in early-stage breast cancer, JNK activation in response to stress signals, such as oxidative stress, induces apoptosis via mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation, as observed in MCF-7 cells [ 70 ]. Conversely, in TNBC, chronic JNK activation promotes survival and metastasis by facilitating autophagy and lysosome biogenesis, as evidenced in MDA-MB-231 cells [ 71 ]. These contradictory roles are often studied in vitro, which may not fully capture the influence of the tumor microenvironment, such as matrix stiffness or immune cell interactions. Moreover, small sample sizes and variability in experimental conditions (e.g., stress stimuli) limit the ability to generalize findings. Future studies should employ patient-derived xenografts or organoids to elucidate JNK\u2019s subtype-specific roles and explore its interactions with lncRNAs, such as LASTR, to develop targeted therapies that exploit its context-dependent functions. JNK structure The JNK family includes three isoforms\u2014JNK1 (MAPK8), JNK2 (MAPK9), and JNK3 (MAPK10)\u2014encoded by genes on chromosomes 10, 5, and 4, respectively. JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, while JNK3 is restricted to the brain, heart, and testes. Each gene produces multiple splice variants, leading to isoforms that differ in size (46\u201355 kDa) and substrate specificity. Structurally, JNKs exhibit conserved kinase domains with N-terminal \u03b2-strand-rich and C-terminal \u03b1-helix-rich lobes connected by a flexible segment [ 72 ]. Key features include the glutamate-aspartate (ED) domain in the N-terminal lobe and the common docking (CD) domain in the C-terminal lobe, essential for protein-protein interactions. ATP-binding and activation loops within the catalytic site are critical for their kinase activity. Structural studies have revealed differences in residues surrounding the ATP-binding site among isoforms, facilitating the development of selective inhibitors. For instance, gatekeeper residues like Met146 in JNK3 and Met108 in JNK1/2 influence drug-binding specificity [ 73 ]\u200b. JNK regulation JNK activation is tightly regulated by scaffold proteins, DUSPs, and feedback loops. Scaffold proteins like JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP1) enhance pathway specificity by bringing JNKs into proximity with upstream activators. Dual phosphorylation by MKK4 and MKK7 is necessary for full activation. The activity of JNK is also modulated by phosphatases such as MKP1 and MKP5, which deactivate JNK by removing phosphate groups. Sustained JNK activation can occur through a feedback mechanism involving mitochondrial ROS and the Sab protein, amplifying the signaling cascade. Dysregulation of these processes is associated with pathophysiological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders. In cancer, JNK isoforms show contrasting roles, with JNK1 promoting and suppressing tumorigenesis in a context-dependent manner, while JNK2 often supports survival and proliferation in tumor cells\u200b [ 74 \u2013 76 ]. This comprehensive understanding of JNK\u2019s signaling, structure, and regulation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases. Fig. 1 Schematic overview of MAPK signaling cascades and their roles in breast cancer pathogenesis. This figure illustrates the three major MAPK pathways\u2014ERK, JNK, and p38\u2014activated by diverse extracellular stimuli, including growth factors (e.g., EGF), cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-\u03b1), hormones, and stress signals (e.g., lipopolysaccharides, Fas ligand, UV radiation, oxidative stress). These stimuli engage membrane-bound receptors, such as RTKs and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), initiating a three-tiered kinase cascade. The cascade comprises MAP3Ks (e.g., C-Raf, B-Raf, A-Raf, MEKKs, MLKs, ASK, TAK1), which phosphorylate MAP2Ks (e.g., MKK1/2 for ERK, MKK4/7 for JNK, MKK3/6 for p38), leading to the activation of MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK1-3, p38\u03b1-\u03b4). Activated MAPKs phosphorylate downstream transcription factors, including ELK1, ATF-2, AP-1, STAT1, c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Myc, and CREB, which regulate key cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, differentiation, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and cancer stem cell maintenance. In breast cancer, dysregulation of these pathways contributes to tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance, particularly in aggressive subtypes like TNBC. The figure highlights the molecular architecture of MAPK signaling and its critical interplay with lncRNAs, which modulate these pathways to influence breast cancer pathogenesis The MAPK pathway in breast cancer To highlight the significance of the MAPK pathway in cancer, HRAS, a critical component of this signaling pathway, was identified as the first oncogene in human cancers [ 34 ]. Ras family is consisted of four small GTPases named H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras, M-Ras, which are activated in an indirect manner through external stimuli, including ligand-dependent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [ 77 ]. Upon Ras activation, the signal is transferred to the Raf, MEK, and ERK1/2 and then to the nucleus [ 31 ]. The target transcription factors of Ras include ELK-1, ETS-1, ETS-2, MYC, and FOS, which all are involved in the cell proliferation and survival [ 78 ]. Aberrant expression levels and activity of MAPK signaling pathway is a common event in a broad range of human malignancies such as melanoma, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer [ 79 ]. However, in breast cancer, the activating mutation in MAPK signal transduction is not as frequent as other epithelial cancers mentioned above. The Ras and Raf families are reported to be mutated in less than 2% of all primary breast tumors [ 80 ]. Other studies reported even less amounts [ 81 \u2013 84 ]. In the case of KRAS mutations, higher rates, approximately 10% were reported in breast cancer [ 85 ]. This suggests the lack of need or lack of use of this pathway by breast cancer cells or healthy epithelial cells to maintain growth and survival. However, despite these findings, an accumulating number of previous studies have considered a critical function for MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer. Other mechanisms such as upregulation of RTKs including HER2 and EGFR can potently stimulate MAPK activity. Increased ERK1/2 activity has been found in metastatic sites in comparison to primary breast tumors and is more common in triple negative breast cancer [ 86 , 87 ]. On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated the high prevalent of transcriptional signatures of activation of the MAPK pathway in triple negative breast cancer [ 88 , 89 ], which suggests that the signaling output of the MAPK pathway constitutes a major component of oncogenic activity in this type of breast cancer [ 90 ]. The MAPK pathway is a pivotal signaling cascade governing diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, migration, and stress responses. Its role in breast cancer is multifaceted, with components like p38 MAPK, ERKs, and JNKs acting as both oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors depending on the molecular context and tumor subtype [ 10 ]. The p38 MAPK pathway is a key mediator of inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis in cancer. In breast cancer, p38 can promote tumor progression or suppression depending on its activation context. For example, in TNBC, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) induces vasculogenic mimicry (VM) by activating the p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. This activation enhances the expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGFR-1 and promotes AP-1 transcriptional activity, which sustains vascularization and tumor growth [ 91 ]. Conversely, p38 MAPK is also linked to apoptotic mechanisms; it regulates the mitochondrial death pathway through upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and activation of caspases [ 92 ]. Experimental evidence suggests that targeting p38 MAPK can impair both angiogenesis and VM, offering a dual opportunity for therapeutic intervention in TNBC. Interestingly, p38 MAPK\u2019s activity is temporally distinct, initiating angiogenesis earlier than the PI3K/Akt pathway. This temporal sequence hints at a potential regulatory hierarchy and interplay, which warrants further investigation to identify therapeutic windows for selective intervention [ 91 ]. The ERK pathway is frequently activated in breast cancer and plays a prominent role in driving proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Aberrant activation of ERK signaling is associated with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. For instance, in HER2-positive breast cancer, the \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22M)-HFE complex activates ERK, enhancing cellular survival and promoting apoptosis resistance under certain conditions [ 70 ]. In TNBC, TNFAIP2-mediated Rac1-ERK activation under hypoxic conditions drives angiogenesis via AP-1 and HIF1\u03b1 transcriptional activation. This signaling axis underscores ERK\u2019s role in sustaining aggressive tumor phenotypes and resistance to hypoxic stress. ERK inhibitors such as U0126 and trametinib have shown synergistic effects when combined with anti-angiogenic therapies like VEGFR inhibitors, providing a promising combinatorial strategy for aggressive breast cancer subtypes. These findings highlight ERK\u2019s critical role as a therapeutic target, particularly in highly angiogenic tumors [ 71 ]. The JNK pathway is uniquely characterized by its dualistic role in breast cancer. On one side, JNK contributes to tumor suppression by inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation. This pro-apoptotic activity is particularly evident under stress conditions, such as matrix stiffness changes in the tumor microenvironment, where JNK mediates apoptosis via ROS signaling [ 93 ]. On the other hand, JNK\u2019s chronic activation has been linked to tumor progression in TNBC, where it facilitates autophagy, lysosome biogenesis, and survival under metabolic stress [ 94 ]. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of JNK using compounds like JNK-IN-8 has shown therapeutic promise in preclinical models. By disrupting JNK-mediated lysosomal trafficking and metabolic adaptations, these inhibitors impair TNBC tumor growth and reduce stemness-related properties. JNK\u2019s involvement in these processes suggests it may serve as both a direct therapeutic target and a modulator of tumor microenvironment interactions [ 95 ]. The MAPK pathways also exhibit feedback and compensatory mechanisms that influence therapeutic outcomes. For example, p38 MAPK activation can precede PI3K/Akt signaling, creating temporal opportunities for combined pathway inhibition [ 96 ]. Similarly, JNK\u2019s modulation of lysosomal activity and autophagy underscores its role in cellular adaptation to stress, which may counteract the effects of ERK-targeted therapies [ 97 ]. Aberrations in MAPK signaling pathways, including ERK, p38, and JNK, significantly contribute to tumorigenesis and therapy resistance in breast cancer, with distinct patterns across subtypes [ 8 ]. For instance, hyperactivation of ERK signaling, often driven by upregulated receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR, is more prevalent in TNBC compared to luminal subtypes, where p38 MAPK may regulate cell cycle progression through distinct downstream targets [ 82 , 83 ]. However, studies often focus on specific cell lines (e.g., MDA-MB-231 for TNBC), limiting insights into subtype-specific mechanisms. Additionally, therapeutic responses to MAPK inhibitors, such as trametinib, vary due to feedback loops and compensatory activation of alternative pathways, particularly in HER2-positive tumors [ 90 ]. These variations highlight the need for multi-omics studies to map subtype-specific MAPK alterations and clinical trials to optimize inhibitor combinations for personalized therapy. Although each MAPK pathway component\u2014p38, ERK, and JNK\u2014exhibits distinct roles, their interplay contributes significantly to breast cancer pathogenesis; however, based on their upstream regulators, downstream targets, and type of breast cancer, their role may vary from an anticancer agent to tumor promotor mediator (Table 1 ). Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing effective combination treatments. The diverse and context-dependent roles of MAPK pathways in breast cancer highlight the importance of regulatory mechanisms controlling these cascades. Emerging research identifies lncRNAs as critical modulators of MAPK signaling, capable of influencing the balance between oncogenic and tumor-suppressive outcomes. The following section explores how lncRNAs interact with MAPK pathways, uncovering novel regulatory networks and therapeutic opportunities that may reshape our approach to breast cancer treatment.

cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion, is frequently dysregulated in breast cancer, contributing to tumor progression and therapy resistance. lncRNAs have emerged as key modulators of this pathway, influencing its activity through diverse molecular mechanisms [ 130 , 131 ]. This signaling is also reported to be targeted by various lncRNAs in breast cancer cells. For example, the upregulated lncRNA LINC00511, which has been demonstrated to have a close correlation with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, is reported to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via targeting MMP-13 [ 16 ]. Knockdown studies have revealed that breast cancer cells transfected with siRNA against LINC00511 showed suppressed proliferation and metastasis. The in-silico analysis showed that p38-alpha and p38-beta are two pivotal targets for LINC00511. Breast cancer cells may also resist proliferation when MMP13 is silenced, and miR-150 is overexpressed [ 16 ]. However, these findings are limited by the use of only two cell lines, which may not capture the molecular heterogeneity across breast cancer subtypes, such as HER2-enriched or luminal tumors. Additionally, small sample sizes in these in vitro studies restrict generalizability. Conflicting evidence suggests that LINC00511\u2019s oncogenic role may be context-dependent, as its expression and function in luminal subtypes remain understudied. Future research should validate these findings in patient-derived organoids or xenografts and explore LINC00511\u2019s role across diverse breast cancer subtypes to clarify its therapeutic potential. Another lncRNA, LncSNHG5 is indicated to be upregulated in breast cancer associated fibroblasts and have critical functions in the formation of premetastatic niche via increasing angiogenesis. These effects were mediated via lncSNHG5-mediated increase in the stability of ZNF281 mRNA, which in turn by regulating CCL2 and CCL5 activate P38 MAPK signaling in endothelial cells [ 132 , 133 ]. Recent evidence has highlighted the interplay between lncRNAs and p38 MAPK in regulating breast cancer pathophysiology. One notable example is ST8SIA6-AS1, a lncRNA associated with poor prognosis in ER- and PR-negative breast cancer, a subtype lacking effective endocrine or targeted therapies. Elevated expression of ST8SIA6-AS1 in this aggressive subtype correlates with advanced tumor stage and reduced survival. Functional studies demonstrate that ST8SIA6-AS1 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, ST8SIA6-AS1 appears to exert its oncogenic effects through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Specifically, ST8SIA6-AS1 knockdown was found to suppress AKT activation while upregulating p38 expression, implicating it as a critical regulator of the pathway in breast cancer. Further, inhibition of p38 signaling reversed the anti-tumor effects of ST8SIA6-AS1 knockdown, emphasizing the centrality of this pathway [ 134 ]. Two lncRNAs, PTENP1 and AC009283.1, have emerged as significant players in the pathogenesis of BC by modulating key regulatory pathways, including the MAPK signaling cascade [ 135 , 136 ]. PTENP1, a pseudogene-derived lncRNA, exerts tumor-suppressive effects by inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, particularly in luminal subtypes. It exerts its effects by modulating several important pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. In the case of AKT signaling, PTENP1 acts as a negative regulator, inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream targets, such as cyclin A2 and CDK2, which are vital for cell cycle progression. Additionally, PTENP1 has been found to regulate MAPK signaling, particularly through the p38 and ERK/MAPK pathways. By downregulating the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and p38 MAPK proteins, PTENP1 impedes crucial processes like cell proliferation and migration in BC cells. This evidence suggests that PTENP1 plays a multifaceted role in controlling both the AKT and MAPK pathways, thus impacting the growth and progression of BC. Notably, the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis may also explain the regulatory mechanism by which PTENP1 regulates the expression of PTEN, thereby influencing tumor progression. Through this ceRNA network, PTENP1 could attenuate the inhibitory effect of microRNAs on PTEN, thereby modulating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways and contributing to the malignant phenotype of BC cells [ 135 , 137 ]. This dual regulation underscores PTENP1\u2019s role as a multifaceted tumor suppressor, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers, where its expression correlates with favorable prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that PTENP1 expression is influenced by tumor microenvironmental factors, such as stromal cell interactions and hypoxia, which may modulate its regulatory capacity [ 138 ]. These findings position PTENP1 as a promising prognostic biomarker for luminal breast cancer subtypes, with potential for guiding personalized treatment strategies. Similarly, AC009283.1 has also been implicated in the progression of breast cancer, particularly in the HER2-enriched subtype. The upregulation of AC009283.1 has been associated with altered cellular processes such as proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Co-expression analysis of AC009283.1 with key mRNAs suggests its involvement in cell cycle regulation and cell survival mechanisms, including the activation of MAPK kinase pathways such as MAP3K1, which is linked to cell survival, migration, and apoptosis. In addition, the overexpression of AC009283.1 in HER2-enriched tumors correlates with VEGF production and the anoikis resistance pathway, both of which are critical in tumor progression and metastasis. The VEGF pathway, in particular, is activated in HER2-positive tumors, promoting angiogenesis and resistance to anti-cancer treatments. By regulating these pathways, AC009283.1 contributes to the malignant characteristics of HER2-enriched BC, making it a promising therapeutic target for this aggressive BC subtype [ 136 , 139 ]. Among the lncRNAs studied in breast cancer, PRNCR1 has been highlighted for its oncogenic role in modulating the miR-377/CCND2/MEK/MAPK axis. PRNCR1 is upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and its depletion has been shown to significantly reduce the viability of breast cancer cells while inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. These effects are mediated by altering the balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic markers such as Bax and Bcl-2. Mechanistically, PRNCR1 functions as a molecular sponge for miR-377, a miRNA with well-documented tumor-suppressive activity. Bioinformatics analyses and experimental validations confirmed that miR-377 directly targets CCND2, a cell cycle regulator linked to cancer cell proliferation. Overexpression of CCND2 was found to enhance the phosphorylation of MEK and p38 MAPK, underscoring its role in promoting breast cancer progression. Treatment with Mirdametinib, a MEK/MAPK pathway inhibitor, effectively countered CCND2-induced breast cancer cell proliferation and restored apoptosis, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. Thus, the PRNCR1/miR-377/CCND2/p38 axis represents a critical molecular mechanism contributing to breast cancer pathogenesis [ 17 ]. Similarly, the lncRNA FOXCUT plays a significant role in the regulation of p38 MAPK signaling in breast cancer. FOXCUT exerts its oncogenic effects by acting as a ceRNA, sponging miR-24-3p, a miRNA with tumor-suppressive properties. Experimental evidence has shown that miR-24-3p directly targets p38, and the overexpression of FOXCUT leads to increased p38 expression, thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Elevated FOXCUT levels have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC, a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, p38 is recognized for its role in facilitating cancer cell survival and metastasis by modulating processes such as glycogen metabolism and genomic stability. The FOXCUT/miR-24-3p/p38 regulatory axis underscores how lncRNAs can drive breast cancer progression by post-transcriptionally regulating key signaling molecules [ 140 ]. The intricate interplay between lncRNAs and the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly through p38 modulation, underscores their pivotal roles in breast cancer progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. LncRNAs such as LINC00511, ST8SIA6-AS1, PTENP1, AC009283.1, PRNCR1, and FOXCUT regulate critical cellular processes by targeting key components of the MAPK cascade, influencing proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (Fig. 2 ). These findings highlight the potential of lncRNAs as biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets, especially in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative and HER2-enriched breast cancers. Moving forward, integrating lncRNA-targeted therapies with MAPK pathway inhibitors, such as Mirdametinib, could offer novel strategies to overcome resistance and improve outcomes. Further research into the ceRNA networks and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs will be crucial for developing precision medicine approaches, paving the way for personalized treatments that address the heterogeneity of breast cancer. Fig. 2 lncRNAs regulate the p38 signaling pathway in breast cancer pathogenesis. lncRNAs modulate p38, ERK, and JNK signaling pathways in breast cancer pathogenesis in a subtype-specific manner. This schematic illustrates the dynamic interactions between key lncRNAs (e.g., PRNCR1, FOXCUT, ST8SIA6-AS1, PTENP1, LINC00473, MIR100HG) and MAPK signaling components. In p38 signaling, PRNCR1 and FOXCUT act as oncogenic ceRNAs, sponging miR-377 and miR-24-3p, respectively, to enhance p38 phosphorylation and drive TNBC progression. Conversely, PTENP1 suppresses p38 and ERK activity via ceRNA-mediated PTEN regulation, inhibiting proliferation in luminal subtypes. ST8SIA6-AS1 promotes p38 activation in TNBC, modulated by microenvironmental cues like inflammatory cytokines. In ERK signaling, LINC00473 enhances pathway activation via miR-198, promoting tumor growth, while LIMT inhibits ERK-driven oncogenesis. In JNK signaling, MIR100HG amplifies tumor progression, while LASTR regulates stress-induced splicing. Green arrows denote tumor-suppressive roles, and black arrows indicate oncogenic influences, highlighting subtype-specific therapeutic opportunities Targeting Erk Ras\u2013ERK signaling pathway, also known as Ras\u2013Raf\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway, is one of the most pivotal kinase signal transductions involved in tumor cell biology [ 141 ]. In mammalian cells, intracellular signal transductions related to ERK are suggested to be the classical MAPK signaling pathway. ERK signaling is activated via RTKs, certain cytokines, and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [ 142 ]. The ERK signaling pathways consist of two distinct axes triggering the MAPK effects on the key biological events like differentiation, cell growth, and apoptosis. These axes include Ras/Raf/MEK1,2/ERK1,2 and Src/Ras/MEKK2,3/MEK5/ERK5 pathways [ 143 ]. Recent investigations have demonstrated the involvement of various lncRNAs in regulating proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of cancer cells via targeting and modulating the expression levels of key components of this pathway. In breast cancer, lncRNA-ERK interaction regulates initiation, progression, and drug resistance. lncRNA NR2F1-AS1, which is an oncogenic lncRNA with upregulated expression pattern in various human malignancies such as thyroid cancer, endometrial cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, is also reported to be involved in the various aspects of breast cancer pathogenesis, especially angiogenesis. Zhang et al. reported a strong positive association between the CD31 and CD34 and the expression levels of this lncRNA [ 144 ]. Breast cancer cells transfected with NR2F1-AS1 showed higher levels of proliferation, migrations and tube formation. In vivo model, also confirmed in vitro finding, such that NR2F1-AS1 was found to elevate the micro vessel density (MVD), promote the tumor vessel formation, and induce primary tumor growth in mice. From the mechanistic point of view, Zhang et al. indicated that cells transfected with have higher expression levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and ERK [ 145 ]. One major pathway involves IGF-1 and its receptor IGF-1R, which drive cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis through ERK activation. IGF-1 is a small polypeptide known for its role in mammary gland development, as well as its oncogenic properties in breast cancer. Elevated IGF-1 levels are associated with increased breast cancer risk and are linked to enhanced tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. IGF-1 also functions as a pro-angiogenic factor, inducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) production in the tumor microenvironment. IGF-1 exerts its effects primarily through binding to IGF-1R, a transmembrane receptor that activates downstream signaling pathways, including ERK/MAPK. Activation of IGF-1R triggers processes such as EMT, stem cell renewal, and modifications in the tumor microenvironment, all of which contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. lncRNAs, such as LINC00473, act as ceRNAs by sponging miRNAs like miR-198, preventing them from targeting critical ERK pathway components such as MAPK1. This lncRNA-mediated regulation enhances IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling, promoting tumor growth, invasion, and EMT. Additionally, IGF-1-induced angiogenesis, driven by VEGF via ERK activation, is further amplified by lncRNAs stabilizing IGF-1R activity. Targeting these interactions, such as using IGF-1R inhibitors or therapies blocking oncogenic lncRNAs, holds promise for treating aggressive or drug-resistant breast cancers, highlighting the therapeutic potential of disrupting lncRNA-regulated ERK signaling [ 145 ]. SNHG6 has been identified as a significant oncogenic factor; its expression is markedly elevated in BC tissues and cell lines, correlating with advanced TNM stage, larger tumor size, and increased metastasis. Functional studies revealed that SNHG6 knockdown suppresses BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SNHG6 functions as a ceRNA, sponging tumor-suppressive miR-26a-5p, which directly targets MAPK6 (ERK3). The SNHG6/miR-26a-5p/MAPK6 axis promotes BC malignancy, as evidenced by reduced MAPK6 expression and BC cell inhibition upon SNHG6 knockdown. This pathway highlights SNHG6\u2019s role as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for BC [ 146 ]. Another lncRNA, MALAT1, exhibits a complex role in BC metastasis, acting as both a promoter and suppressor depending on the context. Its high expression has been linked to poor prognosis and resistance to paclitaxel, a common chemotherapy agent. MALAT1 exerts its oncogenic effects by sponging miR-497-5p, thereby upregulating SHOC2, a scaffold protein essential for the activation of ERK1/2 signaling. SHOC2 forms a ternary complex with RAS and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), enabling the dephosphorylation of RAS-associated RAF proteins, which are critical for full ERK1/2 activation. This facilitates downstream signaling necessary for tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. By upregulating SHOC2, MALAT1 ensures sustained ERK pathway activation, which drives BC metastasis and chemoresistance. Targeting SHOC2 or disrupting the MALAT1/miR-497-5p/SHOC2 axis could mitigate ERK hyperactivation and improve therapeutic outcomes [ 147 ]. LINC00473, another oncogenic lncRNA, is highly expressed in BC and associated with poor prognosis. Its silencing impairs BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, potentially through modulating cell cycle proteins (Cyclin D1 and p21) and EMT markers, E-cadherin and N-cadherin. LINC00473 acts as a ceRNA by sponging miR-198, which targets MAPK1 (ERK2), a key mediator of the ERK/MAPK pathway. This LINC00473/miR-198/MAPK1 axis has been shown to regulate BC cell behavior, with LINC00473 knockdown reversing the aggressive phenotype of BC cells. Given the established roles of MAPK1 in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance, targeting this axis offers promising therapeutic prospects [ 145 ]. In TNBC, MIR100HG has been implicated in promoting malignancy via the ERK/MAPK pathway. MIR100HG expression is significantly upregulated in TNBC tissues and cells, and its silencing suppresses ERK activation and tumor progression. It functions as a ceRNA, sponging miR-5590-3p to upregulate oncogenic targets such as OTX1 (Orthodenticle Homeobox 1). OTX1 is a transcription factor critical in embryonic development, but its aberrant expression in cancers, including TNBC, drives tumor progression. OTX1 regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, enhancing the aggressive characteristics of TNBC cells. Through its interactions with ERK/MAPK signaling components, OTX1 amplifies the pathway\u2019s oncogenic effects, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the MIR100HG/miR-5590-3p/OTX1 axis represents a pivotal mechanism in TNBC pathogenesis. Targeting OTX1 or disrupting its upstream regulators could provide novel therapeutic strategies for combating TNBC [ 148 ]. AU021063 is another oncogenic lncRNA induced via interleukin (IL)\u22126 mediated suppression of domain 5a (Arid5a) expression in breast cancer cells. AU021063 stabilizes tribbles homolog 3 (Trib3) and also activates ERK signaling, finally promoting breast cancer invasion and metastasis [ 149 ]. Linc-RoR is an oncogenic lncRNA promoting the estrogen-independent growth of ER + breast cancer. It is reported that linc-RoR mediated the activation of the ERK pathway, as well as ER signaling under estrogen deprivation conditions [ 150 ]. linc-RoR silencing abolished estrogen deprivation-mediated ERK and ER phosphorylation and activation. More importantly, linc-RoR effects on ERK signaling are found to be mediated via ERK-specific phosphatase Dual Specificity Phosphatase 7 (DUSP7), also known as MKP-X. linc-RoR stabilized DUSP7 and hence repressed ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, DUSP7 was found to be downexpressed in ER + breast cancer patients\u2019 samples in comparison to ER- breast cancer. Accordingly, linc-RoR regulates the ERK-specific phosphatase DUSP7, which promotes estrogen-independent growth of breast cancer cells [ 150 ]. In addition, lncRNA-ERK crosstalk is also reported to be of high importance in the development of resistance against key chemotherapeutics used for breast cancer treatment including Adriamycin and tamoxifen. For example, ARA expression has significant association with Adriamycin sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. Silencing this lncRNA in vitro led to significant reduction in the proliferation, induction in cell death, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and inhibition in migration. microarray transcriptomic revealed that ARA mediated anticancer effects was due targeting ERK signaling pathway [ 151 ]. The lncRNA cytoskeleton regulator RNA (CYTOR) is reported to be contributed in the tamoxifen resistant in breast cancer cells. In addition, it has negative correlation with the miR-125a-5p, which suggested the direct targeting and suppression of miR-125a-5p by this lncRNA [ 152 ]. Moreover, CYTOR upregulation leads to increased expression and activity of ERK pathway in tamoxifen resistant cells. CYTOR silencing downregulated ERK1/2 expression in tamoxifen resistant, indicating that CYTOR is involved in the tamoxifen resistance via attenuation of the ERK pathway [ 152 ]. SNHG6 is one of the upregulated lncRNAs in breast cancer cell lines and tissues that exerts its tumorigenic functions through activating ERK3/MAPK6 signaling. SNHG6 silencing led to inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion via directly binding to miR-26a-5p and down-regulating miR-26a-5p expression. MAPK6 was also validated as a target of SNHG6. Therefore, SNHG6/miR-26a-5p/MAPK6 pathway is suggested as regulatory axis in breast cancer pathogenesis [ 146 ]. As a ceRNA, LINC00473 competes for miR-198, which modulates MAPK1 expression by modulating the expression of lncRNAs. Breast cancer tissues overexpressing LINC00473, therefore, have poor prognoses. The endogenous RNA LINC00473 may regulate MAPK1 expression by sponging miR-198 [ 145 ]. As a downstream signaling pathway regulator, lncRNA THOR plays an important role in breast cancer tumorigenesis. A poor prognosis is associated with THOR upregulation in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues, which showed lower expression levels of this lncRNA in comparison to malignant tissues. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were impaired when THOR was knocked down in breast cancer cells in vitro, along with metastasis and tumorigenesis in tumor xenografts. Through inhibition of the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway, THOR binds to the hnRNPD protein and increases its levels. With increased hnRNPD protein levels, PDK1 and downstream PI3K-AKT pathways were more activated, and the downstream MAPK pathways were further activated as well [ 153 ]. Fig. 3 An illustrative overview of the intricate interactions between lncRNAs, and the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade in the context of breast cancer pathogenesis. Key upstream signals, such as IL-6 binding to IL-R and IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R, initiate the activation of core signaling intermediates, including MKK1/2 and ERK1/2, which drive downstream effects. Specific lncRNAs, including LINC00472, linc-RoR, MIR2052HG, and EPIC1, as well as miRNAs like miR-125a-5p and miR-129, modulate these pathways by regulating pivotal molecular players, such as DUSP7, SHOC2, and ESR1. These interactions influence diverse cellular processes, including EMT, autophagy, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion. The diagram also underscores the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of various molecular components (indicated by black and green arrows, respectively), with an emphasis on transcriptional regulation mediated by downstream targets such as SRF, Myc, and MCM6. Crosstalk with ER\u03b1 signaling is highlighted, further emphasizing its role on ERK signaling in cancer progression. The figure integrates the functional interplay between signaling pathways, lncRNAs, and miRNAs, providing insights into their contributions to breast cancer biology Among the lncRNAs implicated in this pathway, LINC00472 and LIMT emerge as significant tumor suppressors, particularly in aggressive subtypes such as TNBC and basal-like breast cancer [ 145 , 154 ]. Recent studies highlight LINC00472 as a potent regulator of tumorigenesis in TNBC via its interactions with the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. TNBC, one of the most challenging breast cancer subtypes to treat, exhibits frequent hyperactivation of the MEK/ERK pathway, often due to molecular alterations such as the loss of dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4). As illustrated in Fig. 3 , LINC00472 suppresses tumor progression by downregulating MCM6, a critical oncogene associated with DNA replication. Mechanistic investigations reveal that LINC00472 induces methylation of the MCM6 promoter via recruitment of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b), leading to its transcriptional repression. This cascade ultimately inhibits the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation levels of ERK and MEK proteins. Functionally, overexpression of LINC00472 inhibits TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, while also reducing tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Restoration of MCM6 reverses these effects, underscoring the dependency of LINC00472-mediated tumor suppression on MCM6 regulation. Additionally, the tumor-suppressive role of LINC00472 is not confined to TNBC but extends to other cancers, including colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, where it similarly impedes ERK-mediated oncogenic pathways [ 145 ]. Like LINC00472, LIMT, also known as LINC01089, exerts tumor-suppressive effects through modulation of the ERK pathway. Research demonstrates that LIMT expression is downregulated in basal-like and HER2-driven breast cancer subtypes, which are characterized by heightened ERK activity. Functional assays reveal that the suppression of LIMT depends on the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequent RAS-to-ERK signaling. Experimental knockdown of LIMT enhances cellular migration and invasion, indicating its critical role in limiting metastatic potential. This is corroborated by in vivo studies where reduced LIMT levels are associated with increased metastasis. Unlike other lncRNAs that act in cis , LIMT does not appear to regulate neighboring genes, suggesting its function may involve direct interaction with protein or RNA molecules, potentially affecting chromatin remodeling or transcriptional regulation of motility-related genes. Moreover, LIMT \u2019s conserved sequence across vertebrates implies an evolutionarily significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and restricting tumor progression [ 154 ]. Both LINC00472 and LIMT illustrate the intricate interplay between lncRNAs and the ERK signaling cascade in breast cancer. While LINC00472 acts by silencing MCM6 and reducing ERK activation in TNBC, LIMT functions as an EGFR/ERK-controlled suppressor, particularly in basal-like tumors. Their tumor-suppressive effects highlight the potential of lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies targeting the ERK pathway. These findings also underscore the tissue-specific roles of lncRNAs, offering new insights into the molecular underpinnings of breast cancer heterogeneity. Future studies should investigate the broader regulatory networks involving LINC00472 and LIMT, including their interactions with other signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and p53, and their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for ERK-driven cancers.

The JNK pathway is activated by various stressors, including oxidative stress and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, leading to cellular responses such as apoptosis and growth inhibition [ 182 , 183 ]. Activation of the JNK pathway occurs through a hierarchical cascade: MAPKKKs activate MAPKKs (e.g., MKK4 and MKK7), which subsequently phosphorylate and activate JNKs [ 184 ]. Once activated, JNKs translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor c-Jun [ 185 ]. Phosphorylated c-Jun can shuttle back to the cytoplasm, modulating gene expression in pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic processes [ 186 , 187 ]. Given its downstream targets, JNK signaling plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer [ 188 ]. Of particular interest is the emerging evidence linking lncRNAs to JNK signaling in breast cancer progression. One such lncRNA, MIR100HG, has been identified as an oncogenic driver in TNBC. Chen et al. reported that MIR100HG is upregulated, while miR-5590-3p is downregulated in TNBC cells and tissues. Moreover, MIR100HG directly interacts with miR-5590-3p. Functional knockdown studies demonstrated that silencing MIR100HG induced apoptosis, caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and suppressed proliferation, invasion, and migration of TNBC cells, thereby inhibiting tumor progression. Interestingly, the anticancer effects mediated by MIR100HG silencing were completely abrogated by the knockdown of miR-5590-3p. miR-5590-3p, targeting OTX1, was shown to downregulate JNK signaling in TNBC cells, thereby inhibiting migration, invasion, and proliferation while promoting apoptosis. However, MIR100HG-mediated suppression of miR-5590-3p significantly elevated the expression of JNK/MAPK pathway components, including p-JNK, p-MEK, p-MAPK, and p-ERK, which contributed to the promotion of TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings underscore the critical role of the MIR100HG-miR-5590-3p axis in regulating JNK/MAPK signaling and highlight MIR100HG as a promising therapeutic target for TNBC [ 148 ]. CBR3-AS1 exemplifies the role of lncRNAs in JNK-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancer. By competitively binding miR-25-3p, CBR3-AS1 spares JNK1 and MEK4 from miRNA-mediated suppression, thereby promoting their activity and activating the MAPK/JNK pathway. This activation enhances cellular survival under chemotherapeutic stress, particularly against agents like Adriamycin (ADR). Overexpression of CBR3-AS1 not only confers resistance to ADR but is also associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients, underscoring its significance as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic response. Mechanistically, the CBR3-AS1/miR-25-3p/JNK1/MEK4 axis exemplifies how lncRNAs can leverage competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks to modulate key signaling cascades, driving tumor progression and drug resistance [ 171 ]. The lncRNA HOTAIR has garnered considerable attention for its multifaceted roles in breast cancer. It modulates the JNK pathway as part of a broader regulatory network involving the p53 and Akt pathways. In tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, HOTAIR expression is upregulated, promoting proliferation, invasion, and migration. Experimental knockdown of HOTAIR in MCF-7 cells leads to reduced expression of JNK and its downstream effectors, including MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are critical for extracellular matrix remodeling and metastasis. Additionally, HOTAIR influences apoptosis by regulating the p53/MDM2 axis, further highlighting its role in promoting tumor survival and progression. The ability of HOTAIR to simultaneously regulate multiple pathways makes it a central node in breast cancer pathogenesis [ 172 ]. JUNI, an immediate early lncRNA, directly interacts with the JNK pathway to mediate stress responses in cancer cells. Unlike CBR3-AS1 and HOTAIR, which activate JNK indirectly, JUNI binds and antagonizes DUSP14, a phosphatase that negatively regulates JNK. This binding prevents the dephosphorylation of JNK, sustaining its activation under conditions of cellular stress, such as exposure to UV radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. JUNI\u2019s activity creates a positive feedback loop, amplifying JNK signaling and enabling cancer cells to evade apoptosis and enhance migration. This unique mechanism positions JUNI as a critical regulator of cellular survival and adaptability in the tumor microenvironment [ 173 ]. Unlike most lncRNAs that function as upstream regulators of JNK, LASTR operates downstream, mediating the functional consequences of JNK activation. LASTR modulates splicing efficiency by interacting with SART3, a recycling factor in the splicing machinery, and facilitates the dissociation of SART3 from U4/U6 snRNP complexes. This activity impacts cancer cell fitness by inducing splicing defects in genes essential for tumor survival, particularly under conditions of JNK-mediated stress responses. In contrast to CBR3-AS1, HOTAIR, and JUNI, which primarily activate JNK signaling to drive oncogenic processes, LASTR exploits JNK\u2019s stress-induced activity to regulate downstream molecular events, such as alternative splicing. These distinct roles highlight the multifaceted interplay between lncRNAs and the JNK pathway in breast cancer, offering novel insights into their potential as therapeutic targets. Specifically, while most lncRNAs amplify JNK activity to promote tumor progression, LASTR\u2019s downstream role offers an alternative avenue for disrupting cancer cell survival mechanisms. This dichotomy underscores the complexity of lncRNA-mediated regulation in cancer and suggests that targeting LASTR could complement strategies aimed at modulating upstream regulators of JNK. Consequently, LASTR\u2019s unique position in the JNK axis provides a compelling case for its development as a target in combinatorial therapeutic approaches, particularly in radio- and chemotherapy-resistant breast cancers [ 174 ]. The dual roles of certain lncRNAs, such as ST8SIA6-AS1 and MALAT1, in breast cancer pathogenesis underscore their context-dependent functions across different subtypes and MAPK signaling interactions. For instance, ST8SIA6-AS1 promotes proliferation and invasion in ER- and PR-negative breast cancers, particularly TNBC, by enhancing p38 MAPK signaling, yet its tumor-suppressive potential in other contexts remains underexplored [ 134 ]. Similarly, MALAT1 acts oncogenically in TNBC by upregulating ERK signaling via the miR-497-5p/SHOC2 axis, driving paclitaxel resistance and metastasis, but in luminal subtypes, it can suppress migration by modulating ERK/MAPK activity [ 147 ]. These contrasting effects highlight the molecular and subtype-specific regulatory networks involving lncRNAs and MAPK pathways, emphasizing the need for precise mechanistic studies to harness their therapeutic potential effectively. The diverse roles of lncRNAs in regulating the JNK pathway underscore their potential as therapeutic targets in breast cancer. By modulating JNK activity at multiple levels\u2014upstream and downstream lncRNAs orchestrate a complex network of signaling events that promote tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. Targeting these lncRNAs, either through silencing or inhibition of their interactions with key signaling components, represents a promising avenue for therapy. LASTR\u2019s downstream function offers a unique therapeutic opportunity to disrupt cancer-specific splicing processes, while upstream modulators like CBR3-AS1 and HOTAIR provide avenues to inhibit JNK-driven oncogenic signaling. These findings highlight the importance of integrating lncRNA biology into our understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis, paving the way for precision medicine approaches that exploit the unique roles of lncRNAs in the JNK pathway. Conclusion and perspective The interaction between lncRNAs and MAPK signaling pathways has emerged as a critical area of study in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. lncRNAs, acting as versatile molecular regulators, intricately modulate the three major MAPK pathways\u2014p38, ERK, and JNK\u2014thereby influencing a wide array of cellular functions, including proliferation, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. These pathways, known for their dual roles as tumor suppressors or oncogenic drivers, exhibit complex behavior influenced by cellular context, molecular subtype, and environmental stimuli. By acting through ceRNA networks, direct protein interactions, or chromatin remodeling, lncRNAs orchestrate both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive processes, making them key players in breast cancer progression. In the context of p38 MAPK signaling, lncRNAs such as PRNCR1, JUNI, THOR and FOXCUT act as oncogenic regulators, promoting tumorigenesis through enhanced phosphorylation of key pathway components. Conversely, tumor-suppressive lncRNAs like PTENP1 attenuate p38 MAPK activity, thereby inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Similarly, the regulation of ERK signaling by lncRNAs highlights their profound impact on aggressive breast cancer subtypes such as TNBC. For instance, LINC00473, by acting as a ceRNA for miR-198, facilitates ERK pathway activation, driving tumor growth, migration, and invasion. On the other hand, tumor-suppressive lncRNAs like LIMT and LINC00472 mitigate ERK-driven oncogenic effects, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting these lncRNAs. The JNK pathway, while traditionally associated with stress responses and apoptosis, also demonstrates context-dependent roles in breast cancer. Oncogenic lncRNAs such as MIR100HG promote JNK signaling to drive tumor progression, while others like SNHG1 are involved in modulating JNK-related apoptotic and proliferative pathways. These examples highlight the versatile roles lncRNAs play in fine-tuning MAPK signaling, which often determines the outcome of therapeutic interventions (Table 2 ). Despite significant advancements in understanding the role of lncRNA-MAPK interactions, several challenges remain. The redundancy and complexity of MAPK signaling pathways, coupled with the diverse functions of lncRNAs, make it difficult to delineate specific molecular mechanisms in various breast cancer subtypes. Additionally, the context-dependent roles of lncRNAs\u2014acting as oncogenes in some scenarios and tumor suppressors in others\u2014further complicate their characterization. However, these challenges also present opportunities. The identification of lncRNAs such as LINC00473, LIMT, and PRNCR1 as modulators of MAPK pathways highlights their potential as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. For instance, elevated levels of oncogenic lncRNAs could serve as indicators of aggressive tumor behavior, while tumor-suppressive lncRNAs might be leveraged to predict therapeutic response or disease progression. From a therapeutic perspective, targeting the lncRNA-MAPK axis offers a promising avenue for innovation. Strategies such as antisense oligonucleotides, RNA interference, or CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing could be employed to silence oncogenic lncRNAs or restore tumor-suppressive ones. Furthermore, combining lncRNA-targeted therapies with existing MAPK inhibitors could enhance treatment efficacy, particularly in drug-resistant and metastatic breast cancer subtypes. Such combination therapies may also mitigate the compensatory activation of alternative pathways, a common challenge in targeting MAPK signaling alone. Looking ahead, integrating multi-omics approaches combining transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics will be crucial to unravel the context-specific mechanisms of lncRNA-MAPK interactions across diverse breast cancer subtypes. Such studies could identify novel lncRNA targets and refine therapeutic strategies. However, challenges remain, including the complexity of lncRNA regulatory networks, their redundancy, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment on lncRNA expression and function. The role of stromal cells, immune infiltrates, and extracellular matrix components in modulating lncRNA-MAPK signaling warrants further exploration. Additionally, the scarcity of functional studies in patient-derived models, such as organoids or xenografts, limits our understanding of lncRNA dynamics in clinically relevant settings. Addressing these gaps through rigorous preclinical and clinical studies will be essential to validate lncRNAs as reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To advance the clinical translation of lncRNA-MAPK interactions, existing strategies targeting MAPK pathways, such as inhibitors like trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and ulixertinib (ERK inhibitor), provide a foundation but face challenges like drug resistance due to feedback loops and pathway crosstalk. LncRNA-targeted therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs, are emerging as promising tools to modulate oncogenic lncRNAs like HOTAIR or restore tumor-suppressive ones like PTENP1. However, drug development hurdles, such as achieving specific delivery to tumor cells, ensuring stability in vivo, and minimizing off-target effects, remain significant. Emerging RNA-based therapies, such as nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery or CRISPR/Cas13 systems for RNA targeting, offer innovative solutions to these challenges. Clinical trials exploring ASOs in other cancers (e.g., STAT3-targeted ASOs in lymphoma) suggest feasibility, and adapting these approaches for breast cancer could yield novel treatments. Combining lncRNA-targeted therapies with MAPK inhibitors holds potential to overcome resistance and enhance efficacy, warranting further exploration in preclinical and clinical settings. In conclusion, the interplay between lncRNAs and MAPK signaling pathways represents a complex and multifaceted regulatory network in breast cancer pathogenesis. By modulating critical cellular processes, lncRNAs not only contribute to tumor progression but also offer unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the context-specific roles of lncRNAs in MAPK signaling will be instrumental in developing innovative diagnostic tools and treatment strategies. As research in this field progresses, the integration of lncRNA-targeted approaches with existing therapies holds the potential to significantly improve outcomes for breast cancer patients, particularly those with aggressive and treatment-resistant subtypes. By leveraging these insights, we can move closer to personalized and more effective breast cancer care.

    "full_text_abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as key modulators of gene expression and cellular processes, playing pivotal roles in cancer biology. In breast cancer, a multifaceted malignancy driven by diverse genetic and epigenetic alterations, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is critical for regulating processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Emerging research highlights intricate interactions between lncRNAs and MAPK signaling components, including ERK, p38, and JNK, revealing novel regulatory mechanisms underlying breast cancer development and progression. These interactions often involve lncRNAs modulating MAPK pathway activity or engaging in crosstalk with other oncogenic networks. This review explores how lncRNAs influence MAPK signaling in breast cancer pathogenesis, emphasizing their dual roles as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the molecular context. While these findings suggest that lncRNAs could serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to influence tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance, challenges such as study heterogeneity, conflicting functional outcomes, and the complexity of lncRNA-MAPK interactions limit immediate clinical translation. By elucidating these molecular relationships, we aim to provide insights into breast cancer biology and highlight the potential, as well as the limitations, of leveraging lncRNA-MAPK interactions for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, pending further mechanistic and clinical validation.
