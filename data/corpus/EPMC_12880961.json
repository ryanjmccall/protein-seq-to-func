  "abstract_text": "Neuroblastoma (NBL) is a common pediatric cancer originated from the neuronal precursor cells of sympathoadrenal lineage. NBLs show a variety of clinical phenotypes from spontaneous regression to malignant progression with acquirement of resistance to therapy. To understand the molecular mechanism of the genesis, progression, and regression of NBL, we need to identify key molecules determining the neuronal development of sympathoadrenal lineage. To this end, we have performed the NBL cDNA project. It includes (1) mass-cloning of the expressed genes from oligo-capping cDNA libraries derived from primary NBLs with different clinical and biological features; (2) mass-identification of differentially expressed genes between favorable and unfavorable subsets; and (3) molecular and functional analyses of the novel genes, which could be useful prognostic indicators. To date, 10,000 cDNA clones in total, approximately 40% of which contained novel sequences, were randomly picked up and DNA sequenced. We have identified approximately 500 differentially expressed genes between favorable and unfavorable subsets of NBL, among which more than 250 were the genes with unknown function.",
