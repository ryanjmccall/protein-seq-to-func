  "abstract_text": "Although interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 participate in allergic inflammation and share a receptor subunit (IL-4Ralpha), they have different functions. We compared cells expressing type I and II IL-4Rs with cells expressing only type II receptors for their responsiveness to these cytokines. IL-4 induced highly efficient, gammaC-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), whereas IL-13 was less effective, even when phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) was maximal. Only type I receptor, gammaC-dependent signaling induced efficient association of IRS-2 with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2. In addition, IL-4 signaling through type I IL-4Rs induced more robust expression of a subset of genes associated with alternatively activated macrophages than did IL-13. Thus, IL-4 activates signaling pathways through type I IL-4Rs qualitatively differently from IL-13, which cooperate to induce optimal gene expression.",
