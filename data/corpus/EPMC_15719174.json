  "abstract_text": "The cells of an ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) patient, homozygous for a new aprataxin mutation (T739C), were treated with camptothecin, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I which induces DNA single-strand breaks. DNA damage was evaluated by cytogenetic analysis of chromosomal aberrations. The results obtained showed marked and dose-related increases in induced chromosomal aberrations in the patient and her heterozygous mother compared to the intrafamilial wild-type control. The alkaline comet assay confirmed this pattern. Moreover, the AOA1 cells did not show hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, i.e. X-rays. These findings clearly indicate the direct involvement of aprataxin in the DNA single-strand-break repair machinery.",
