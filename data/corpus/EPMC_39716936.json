Abstract Pharmacological reactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 remains a key challenge for the treatment of cancer. Ace tylation Ta rgeting C himera (AceTAC), a novel technology is previously reported that hijacks lysine acetyltransferases p300/CBP to acetylate the p53Y220C mutant. However, p300/CBP are the only acetyltransferases harnessed for AceTAC development to date. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that the TAF1 acetyltransferase can be recruited to acetylate p53Y220C. A novel TAF1\u2010recruiting AceTAC, MS172 is discovered, which effectively acetylates p53Y220C lysine 382 in a concentration\u2010, time\u2010 and TAF1\u2010dependent manner via inducing the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1. Notably, MS172 suppresses the proliferation in multiple p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines more potently than the previously reported p300/CBP\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC MS78 with little toxicity in p53 WT and normal cells.

Sci. 2025 , 12 , 2413377 . 10.1002/advs.202413377 1 Introduction Protein acetylation is one of the most important post\u2010translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate fundamental biological functions such as cell cycle and chromatin remodeling in cells. [ 1 ] Lysine acetylation involves the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT)\u2010catalyzed transfer of the acetyl group from the cofactor acetyl\u2010CoA to the \u03b5\u2010amino group of lysine residues, leading to the regulation of distinct protein activity and functions. [ 2 ] A number of KATs have been identified and they can share substrate specificity and be divided into three main families: 1) GCN5, 2) p300, and 3) MYST. [ 3 ] On the other hand, lysine acetylation can be reversed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), which include Zn 2+ \u2010dependent deacetylases and NAD + \u2010dependent deacetylases. [ 3 ] Dysregulated protein lysine acetylation can lead to the pathogenesis of multiple diseases such as cancer, inflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. [ 4 ] Thus, the development of a selective and targeted protein acetylation (TPA) strategy is a potential therapeutic approach to thwart the progression of diseases such as cancer. Previously, we reported a novel technology and modality, termed Ace tylation Ta rgeting C himera (AceTAC), for inducing targeted protein acetylation. [ 5 ] AceTAC is a heterobifunctional small molecule that induces selective acetylation of a protein\u2010of\u2010interest (POI) by hijacking the p300/CBP acetyltransferases. [ 5 ] We discovered MS78, the first\u2010in\u2010class AceTAC, which links a selective small\u2010molecule binder of p53Y220C to a selective small\u2010molecule ligand of p300/CBP. [ 5 ] MS78 induced p53Y220C acetylation in a concentration\u2010 and time\u2010dependent manner and had superior antiproliferation activities compared to the parent p53Y220C binder. [ 5 ] Importantly, AceTAC is the first small molecule\u2010based TPA modality that does not require any genetic manipulation to induce protein acetylation. [ 6 ] We also performed structure\u2010activity relationship (SAR) studies on p300/CBP\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTACs. [ 7 ] Recently, it was reported that PCAF/GCN5 can be hijacked for protein acetylation using a chemogenetic approach. [ 8 ] However, this approach requires the genetic tagging of specific proteins, [ 8 ] making it difficult to develop into cancer therapies. In this study, we demonstrated that TATA\u2010binding protein\u2010associated factor 1 (TAF1), which is the biggest subunit of the multi\u2010protein Transcription Factor II D (TFIID) complex, can be utilized as a KAT for targeted protein acetylation. [ 9 , 10 ] TAF1 is known to initiate the transcriptional preinitiation complex (PIC) formation through the recognition of the core promoter region of genes and also interacts with MYC to regulate gene transcription. [ 11 , 12 ] Full\u2010length TAF1 possesses six distinct domains including an N\u2010terminal kinase domain, an acetyltransferase domain, followed by ubiquitin\u2010activating/conjugating domain (E1/E2), two tandem bromodomains categorized as TAF1\u2010BD1 and TAF1\u2010BD2, and a C\u2010terminal kinase domain. [ 10 , 13 ] However, whether TAF1 can be hijacked for targeted protein acetylation has never been shown. We discovered the first\u2010in\u2010class TAF1\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC, MS172, which effectively acetylates p53Y220C without changing p53 protein levels. We validated the MS172\u2010induced ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1 via both biochemical and cellular assays. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MS172 is selective for TAF1\u2010BD2 over several other bromodomain\u2010containing acetyltransferases. MS172 also exhibits a superior anti\u2010proliferative effect compared to the parent p53Y220C binder, TAF1 bromodomain binder and p300/CBP\u2010recruiting AceTAC, MS78, in multiple cancer cell lines harboring the p53Y220C mutation. Lastly, we discovered that the p53Y220C acetylation induced by MS172 upregulates metallothionine protein functions using RNA\u2010seq and RT\u2010qPCR studies. Overall, we showed that the TAF1 acetyltransferase can be harnessed for inducing targeted protein acetylation. 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Design and Synthesis of TAF1\u2010Recruiting p53Y220C\u2010Targeting AceTACs Similar to our previous AceTAC design, we analyzed the co\u2010crystal structure of p53Y220C in complex with PK9328 (PDB ID: 6GGF), a previously reported p53Y220C small\u2010molecule stabilizer, and utilized the solvent\u2010exposed methylamine group as a suitable exit vector for attaching linkers ( Figure 1 a ). [ 5 , 7 , 14 ] To recruit TAF1 for inducing acetylation without significant loss of its KAT activity, we chose to utilize a small\u2010molecule binder of the TAF1 bromodomain, but not small\u2010molecule inhibitors of TAF1 acetyltransferase. [ 15 ] There are several reported TAF1 bromodomain binders including benzoisoquinolinedione\u2010based compounds, such as BAY\u2010299, [ 16 ] naphthyridones, such as compound 23, [ 17 ] and dual TAF1 and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase inhibitor, AZD6738. [ 18 ] In this study, we utilized GNE\u2010371, which contains a pyrrolopyridone core and is a potent and selective TAF1\u2010BD2 binder with a K D of 1 n m and over 2000\u2010fold selectivity against BRD4. [ 19 ] The co\u2010crystal structure of TAF1\u2010BD2 in complex with GNE\u2010371 (PDB ID: 6DF7) revealed that the benzimidazole ring forms a hydrogen bond interaction with the gatekeeper Tyr1589 residue and the morpholine moiety of GNE\u2010371 is solvent\u2010exposed Figure 1b . [ 19 ] We replaced the solvent\u2010exposed morpholine group with the piperazine group which serves as a handle for linker installation. We designed and synthesized a series of putative TAF1\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTACs (1\u201312) using either an alkylene linker or polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker (Figure 1c,d ; Schemes S1 and S2 , Supporting Information).

Total cell lysate was used for WB and vinculin was used as a loading control. F) Quantification of the fold change of the p53K382ac level (p53K382ac level over total p53 protein level) for the WB results shown in panel E and its biological repeat. To evaluate these putative TAF1\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTACs, we utilized an NCI\u2010H1299 cell line which is endogenously p53\u2010null to stably express the FLAG tagged p53Y220C mutant, termed H1299\u2010p53Y220C. We observed that both PK9328 and GNE\u2010371 at 5 \u00b5 m (8 h treatment) did not significantly induce acetylation of p53Y220C lysine 382 residue (p53K382ac) in H1299\u2010p53Y220C cell line (Figure 1e,f ). On the other hand, compound 2 (MS172) at 5 \u00b5 m (8 h treatment) induced the most significant increase in the p53K382ac level (\u224810\u2010fold) among the 12 AceTAC compounds tested (Figure 1e,f ). Notably, TAF1\u2010based p53Y220C AceTACs with a longer alkylene linker (such as 8\u2010carbon linker) or a PEG linker did not induce significant p53Y220C K382 acetylation (Figure 1e,f ). Overall, we identified MS172 as the most effective TAF1\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC from this SAR study and selected this compound for further characterization. 2.2 MS172 Induces p53Y220C Acetylation in a Concentration\u2010 and Time\u2010Dependent Manner in Endogenously p53Y220C\u2010Expressing Cells We next assessed the effect of MS172 on inducing p53Y220C K382 acetylation in the endogenously p53Y220C\u2010expressing BxPC3 (p53Y220C/\u2010) cell line. Compared to PK9328 and GNE\u2010371, MS172 induced significant p53Y220C K382 acetylation, even at 300 n m , in BxPC3 cells ( Figure 2 a,b ). We determined that the p53K382ac induced by MS172 in BxPC3 cells is concentration\u2010dependent with an ACE 50 (the concentration at which 50% of p53Y220C is acetylated) of 182 \u00b1 0 n m (with the acetylation level induced by MS172 at 1000 n m as the maximum response, Figure 2c ). To assess whether MS172 induces total p53 acetylation, we employed an enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects endogenous levels of total acetylated p53. Compared to PK9328, MS172 significantly induced total p53 lysine acetylation, even at 100 n m (Figure 2d ). In addition, MS172 induced p53K382 acetylation in a time\u2010dependent manner. It increased the p53K382ac level by about two\u2010fold at 4 h and by \u224810\u2010fold at 24 h (Figure 2e,f ). Overall, these results demonstrate that MS172 effectively induces p53Y220C acetylation in a concentration\u2010 and time\u2010dependent manner in p53Y220C\u2010harboring cells.

B) WB results of the p53K382ac level in BxPC3 cells treated with PK9328, GNE\u2010371, or MS172 at 0, 100, 300, or 1000 n m for 24 h. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Total cell lysate was used for WB and vinculin was used as a loading control.

A p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (DO\u20101) was coated onto the microwells of an ELISA plate. After incubation with total cell lysates for 2 h, p53 was captured by the coated antibody. Following extensive washing, acetylated\u2010lysine rabbit monoclonal antibody was added to detect the total acetylated lysine on p53. An anti\u2010rabbit IgG with horse\u2010radish\u2010peroxidase (HRP) linked antibody was then used to recognize the bound detection antibody. Vehicle treatment was used to normalize the fold change of the total p53 lysine acetylation level. The results shown are the mean values \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. * p <.05, *** p <.001. E) WB results of the p53K382ac level in BxPC3 cells treated with 1000 n m of MS172 at the indicated time point. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments.

F) Quantification of the fold change of the p53K382ac level from the WB results shown in panel E and its biological repeat. Vehicle treatment from each specific time point was used to normalize the fold change of the p53K382ac level. 2.3 MS172 Induces Ternary Complex Formation Between p53Y220C and TAF1 To determine whether MS172 induces a ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1, we first assessed the target engagement profile of MS172. We expressed and purified both p53Y220C\u2010DBD and TAF1\u2010BD2 and performed a protein thermal shift assay to determine the binding and stabilization effect of MS172 ( Figure 3 a,b ). We observed a concentration\u2010dependent thermal stability shift (\u0394T M ) of both proteins by MS172 with a \u0394T M of 3.5 and 5.8 \u00b0C for p53Y220C\u2010DBD and TAF1\u2010BD2, respectively, at 50 \u00b5 m (Figure 3a,b ). To further assess selectivity against other homologous bromodomain\u2010containing proteins, we also expressed and purified BRD4\u2010BD2, CBP\u2010BD, and PCAF\u2010BD (Figure S1 , Supporting Information). Even at a higher concentration (100 \u00b5 m ), we found that MS172 did not stabilize bromodomains of BRD4, CBP, and PCAF (Figure S2 , Supporting Information). In summary, MS172 stabilized p53Y220C and bound to TAF1 selectively over several other bromodomain\u2010containing proteins. Figure 3 MS172 induces ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1. Thermal shift assay (TSA) results of p53Y220C\u2010DBD A) and TAF1\u2010BD2 B) induced by MS172. The results shown are the mean values \u00b1 SD from three biological repeats. C) FRET\u2010based biochemical assay results for GNE\u2010371\u2010 and MS172\u2010mediated ternary complex formation between GST\u2010TAF1\u2010BD2 and p53Y220C\u2010DBD\u2010His. Briefly, anti\u2010GST and anti\u2010His HTRF antibody pairs bind to GST\u2010tagged TAF1\u2010BD2 and His\u2010tagged p53Y220C\u2010DBD. A HTRF signal is generated only if the compound binds and the ternary complex is formed and a signal is normalized to the DMSO treatment. The results shown are the mean values \u00b1 SD from two biological repeats. D) Representative WB results of MS172\u2010mediated p53Y220C\u2010TAF1 interaction via p53\u2010FLAG pull\u2010down in H1299\u2010p53\u2010null and H1299\u2010p53Y220C cells treated with MS172 at 0, 1, or 10 \u00b5 m for 24 h. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments. Total cell lysate was used for WB and vinculin was used as a loading control. E) Representative WB results of p53\u2010FLAG pull\u2010down after treatment of H1299\u2010p53Y220C cells with DMSO or MS172 at 10 \u00b5 m for 24 h with either control shRNA or TAF1 shRNA. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments. Total cell lysate was used for WB and vinculin was used as a loading control. F) WB results of p53\u2010FLAG pulldown after treatment of H1299\u2010p53Y220C cells with GNE\u2010371 alone at 10 \u00b5 m , MS172 alone at 3 \u00b5 m , or GNE\u2010371 pretreatment at 10 \u00b5 m for 4 h, followed by MS172 treatment at 3 \u00b5 m for 20 h. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments. Total cell lysate was used for WB and vinculin was used as a loading control. Next, we performed a Time\u2010resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR\u2010FRET) biochemical assay to assess the protein\u2010protein interaction between p53Y220C\u2010DBD and TAF1\u2010BD2 in the presence of MS172 (Figure 3c ). We observed that MS172 induced ternary complex formation between p53Y220C\u2010DBD and TAF1\u2010BD2 while GNE\u2010371 did not (Figure 3c ). We also performed immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments to pull down FLAG\u2010tagged p53Y220C to assess the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1 intracellularly (Figure 3d ). As expected, MS172 induced an interaction between p53Y220C and TAF1 and induced p53K382ac in a concentration\u2010dependent manner in H1299\u2010p53Y220C cells, whereas no interaction was observed in H1299\u2010p53\u2010null cells (Figure 3d ). To further confirm that p53Y220C K382 acetylation depends on TAF1, we knocked down TAF1 using shRNA in the H1299\u2010p53Y220C cell line and monitored the p53Y220C\u2010TAF1 interaction and p53Y220C K382 acetylation induced by MS172 (Figure 3e ). Upon treatment with MS172, there was an induction of the p53K382ac level in control shRNA\u2010treated cells concurrent with the interaction between p53Y220C and TAF1 (Figure 3e ). On the other hand, the interaction between p53Y220C and TAF1 and p53Y220C K382 acetylation in the TAF1 shRNA\u2010treated cells was significantly diminished (Figure 3e ), thereby confirming that the MS172\u2010mediated p53Y200C K382 acetylation is dependent on TAF1 interaction. Finally, we performed a competition rescue experiment to further validate the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1 (Figure 3f ). By pretreating H1299\u2010p53Y220C cells with 10 \u00b5 m of GNE\u2010371 for 4 h, the p53Y220C\u2010TAF1 interaction was significantly abolished and the p53K382ac level induced by MS172 was significantly reduced Figure 3f . To further confirm that MS172 does not recruit p300, we performed a FLAG\u2010tag pulldown experiment with MS78 as a positive control. As expected, MS78 induced a ternary complex interaction between p53Y220C and p300 acetyltransferase, whereas MS172 did not induce any ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and p300 acetyltransferase (Figure S3 , Supporting Information). Altogether, we confirmed that MS172\u2010induced p53Y220C K382 acetylation depends on the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1 acetyltransferase by utilizing biochemical, FLAG\u2010IP, knockdown, and rescue experiments in isogenic cell lines. 2.4 MS172 Effectively Inhibits The Proliferation in p53Y220C\u2010Harboring Cancer Cells and is More Potent Than the p300/CBP\u2010Recruiting AceTAC MS78 Next, we compared the effects of MS172 to the p300/CBP\u2010recruiting AceTAC MS78 on inducing p53Y220C acetylation and their anti\u2010proliferative activity in multiple p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines (BxPC3 (p53Y220C/\u2010), NUGC3 (p53Y220C/+), and Huh7 (p53Y220C/\u2010)). First, we observed that MS172 induced p53Y220C K382 acetylation more effectively than MS78 in BxPC3, NUGC3, and Huh7 cells ( Figure 4 a\u2013c ). As expected, both PK9328 and GNE\u2010371 did not increase the p53K382ac level compared to the baseline at the concentrations tested (Figure 4a\u2013c ). We also assessed the total p53 lysine acetylation induced by MS172 and saw a significant upregulation compared to PK9328, GNE\u2010371, and MS78 (Figure 4d ). To examine the correlation between p53Y220C acetylation and anti\u2010proliferative activity, we performed cell viability experiments for MS172, MS78, PK9328, and GNE\u2010371 in all three cell lines (Figure 4e ). As expected, MS172 displayed the most potent anti\u2010proliferative activity and is more potent than MS78 in all three p53Y220C\u2010harboring cell lines (Figure 4f ; Table S1 Supporting Information). Altogether, MS172 is more effective than MS78 in both inducing p53Y220C acetylation and suppressing the proliferation in multiple p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines. Figure 4 MS172 effectively acetylates p53Y220C and inhibits the growth in p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines and is non\u2010toxic in p53 WT cells.

The results shown are representative of two independent experiments. Total cell lysate was used for WB and vinculin was used as a loading control.

The results shown are the mean values \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. * p <.05, ** p <.01. E) Cell viability of PK9328, GNE\u2010371, MS78 and MS172 in BxPC3, NUGC3, and Huh7 cells. The cells were treated with DMSO or the indicated compound for 72 h. The mean values \u00b1 SD from three biological experiments (each in technical triplicates) are shown. GraphPad Prism 8 was used in the analysis of raw data. F) WB results of PK9328, GNE\u2010371, and MS172 in U2OS cells treated with the indicated compound at 0, 100, 300, or 1000 n m for 24 h. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments. Total cell lysate was used for WB and vinculin was used as a loading control. G) Cell viability of PK9328, GNE\u2010371, and MS172 in U2OS cells. The cells were treated with the indicated compound for 72 h. The mean value \u00b1 SD for each concentration (in technical triplicates from two biological experiments) is shown in the curves. GraphPad Prism 8 was used in the analysis of raw data. We then tested the cytotoxicity profile of MS172 in both p53 wildtype (WT) cell lines and normal cells. MS172 did not induce any significant p53 K382 acetylation at the concentrations tested in U2OS, a p53 WT cell line, similar to PK9328 and GNE\u2010371 (Figure 4f ). Additionally, MS172 as well as PK9328 and GNE\u201037 did not display a significant cell growth inhibition effect in U2OS cells (Figure 4g ). We also assessed the effect MS172 on the growth of normal prostate PNT2 cells and did not observe significant growth inhibition (Figure S4 , Supporting Information). Finally, we evaluated the in vivo mouse pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MS172 (Figure S5 , Supporting Information). We determined the plasma concentrations of MS172 in Swiss albino mice following a single intraperitoneal (IP) administration of 50 mg kg \u22121 . The plasma concentrations of MS172 were \u2248 0.7 \u00b5 m for the first 2 h and maintained above 0.5 \u00b5 m for 8 h post the IP injection (Figure S5 , Supporting Information). We did not observe significant toxicity of MS172 in vivo and the compound was well tolerated in the treated mice. Future studies to assess in vivo efficacy of MS172 are warranted. Taken together, these results indicate that MS172 is non\u2010toxic in p53 WT cancer cells and normal cells and has sufficient mouse PK properties to be used as a chemical biology tool to investigate the role of p53Y220C acetylation in vivo. 2.5 Novel Regulation of Metallothionine Proteins by MS172 in BxPC3 Cells Finally, we evaluated the downstream signaling difference between MS172 and the parent p53Y220C stabilizer PK9328. While we previously assessed the effect of MS78 in H1299\u2010p53Y220C cells, [ 5 ] we did not evaluate 1) the effect of p53Y220C AceTAC in a cell line that endogenously expresses p53Y220C, and 2) which genes are regulated first after p53Y220C acetylation. Thus, we performed an RNA\u2010sequencing (RNA\u2010seq) study in BxPC3 cells treated with DMSO, PK9328, or MS172 at 5 \u00b5 m for 4 h, a relatively early time point ( Figure 5 ). Interestingly, while PK9328 induced the upregulation of typical p53\u2010regulated target genes such as BAX , CHEK1 , and CDKN1A , it also induced the expression of NFKB1 , KRAS , and MDM2 genes at this early time point (Figure 5a ), which is consistent with previous RNA\u2010seq and RT\u2010qPCR results of p53Y220C stabilizers. [ 20 , 21 , 22 ] On the other hand, at this early time point, MS172 treatment significantly upregulated MT1X, MT1N, PLK1 , and DKK1 genes (Figure 5a ). Particularly, we compared the gene expression profile of MS172 to PK9328 (after normalization with DMSO\u2010treated samples) and observed a significant upregulation of these metallothionine proteins while a downregulation of zinc\u2010finger containing proteins (log 2 fold change >2, p \u2010value <0.05, Figure 5b ). It was reported previously that WT p53 can bind metallothionine proteins and inactivation of WT p53 leads to a downregulation of metal response elements (MREs). [ 23 , 24 ] However, to the best of our knowledge, the regulation of metallothionine proteins by p53Y220C has not been previously reported. Furthermore, unbiased analysis using differential gene expression (DGE) and enrichment in KEGG pathways revealed that MS172 treatment led to the upregulation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation compared to PK9328 (q\u2010value = 0.005, normalized enrichment score (NES) = 1.49) (Figure 5c,d ). These results are consistent with previous studies which showed that metallothionine proteins are involved in oxidative stress and inhibition of metallothionine proteins can increase cancer cell growth by regulating zinc\u2010finger proteins. [ 25 , 26 ] To validate the RNA\u2010seq results, we performed a subsequent RT\u2010qPCR study in BxPC3 cells treated with DMSO, PK9328, or MS172 at different concentrations (Figure 5e ). We observed a concentration\u2010dependent upregulation of MT1X and MT1N genes and a simultaneous downregulation of ZNF391 and ZNF778 genes at 4 h time point induced by MS172, while PK9328 treatment led to no changes compared to the DMSO control. We also determined whether these novel pathways are regulated in other p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines as well as p53\u2010WT and p53\u2010null cell lines (Figure S6 , Supporting Information). MS172 indeed induced the expression of MT1X and MT1N genes while suppressing ZNF391 and ZNF778 genes at 4 h time point in NUGC3 cell line, but not in p53\u2010WT (HCT116) and p53\u2010null (NCI\u2010H1299) cell lines (Figure S6 , Supporting Information). It should be noted while these short\u2010treatment RNA\u2010seq and RT\u2010qPCR studies revealed a novel mechanism of action for MS172, additional studies are warranted to assess how the changes in these gene pathways at an early time point lead to differential gene expression at later time points compared to the parent p53Y220C stabilizer. Moreover, further studies to determine whether p53Y220C acetylation by AceTAC leads to novel DNA\u2010binding by p53Y220C are also warranted. In summary, we observed a novel regulation of metallothionine proteins by MS172\u2010induced p53Y220C acetylation compared to the parent p53Y220C stabilizer.

D) KEGG pathway analysis of upregulated pathways upon 5 \u00b5 m of MS172 treatment compared to 5 \u00b5 m of PK9328 for 4 h in triplicates. E) RT\u2010qPCR of MT1X , MT1N , ZNF391 , and ZNF778 expression in BxPC3 cells treated with DMSO, PK9328, or MS172 at 0.2, 1, or 5 \u00b5 m for 4 h from three independent experiments. The mRNA expression for each gene was first normalized to internal GAPDH and then calculated relative to the DMSO control. * p <.05, ** p <.01, *** p <.001. 3 Conclusion In this study, we discovered and characterized the first\u2010in\u2010class TAF1\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC, MS172. MS172 effectively induced p53Y220C K382 acetylation and increased total p53Y2220C acetylation in a concentration\u2010 and time\u2010dependent manner. We validated that the p53Y220C K382 acetylation induced by MS172 depends on the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1 using a battery of biochemical, immunoprecipitation, knockdown, and rescue experiments. We also determined that MS172 effectively induced p53Y220C K382 acetylation and inhibited the proliferation in multiple p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines. Notably, MS172 is more potent than the parent p53Y220C binder PK9328, the TAF1 bromodomain binder GNE\u2010371, and our previously reported p300/CBP\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC MS78 in inducing p53Y220C K382 acetylation and total p53 acetylation in multiple p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines. Importantly, our TAF1\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC MS172 is effective in suppressing the tumor cell growth in multiple cancer cell lines including pancreatic (BxPC3), gastric (NUGC3), and liver (Huh7), and is more potent than PK9328, GNE\u2010371, and MS78, providing a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of p53Y220C\u2010based solid cancers. Furthermore, MS172 is non\u2010toxic in p53 WT and normal cells and is bioavailable in mice via IP administration, thus making it suitable for in vivo efficacy studies. Lastly, we uncovered novel upregulation of metallothionein proteins mediated by MS172\u2010induced p53Y220C acetylation using RNA\u2010seq and RT\u2010qPCR studies. While our proof\u2010of\u2010concept study shows potential therapeutic utilities of TAF1\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC, it should be noted that the lead compound from this proof\u2010of\u2010concept study, MS172, which displayed superior antiproliferative effects than the parent p53Y200C stabilizer, is not a drug candidate. Further optimization of MS172, which is a useful tool compound, is needed to develop a clinical candidate for translating this therapeutic approach in the clinic. It is likely that p53Y220C AceTAC will provide a complementary therapeutic approach to Rezatapopt (PC14586), a p53Y220C small\u2010molecule stabilizer in clinical development, which has shown some efficacy in p53Y220C\u2010 harboring solid cancers. [ 27 ] Currently, AceTAC targeting p53 is limited to p53Y220C, due to the lack of bona fide small\u2010molecule binders for WT p53 or other p53 mutants. However, in the future, upon the development of bona fide small\u2010molecule binders for WT p53 or other p53 mutants by the scientific community, novel AceTACs targeting WT p53 or other p53 mutants will be developed, which could augment p53\u2010acetylation mediated tumor suppression for the treatment of cancer. Overall, we have demonstrated that the TAF1 acetyltransferase can be harnessed for AceTAC development, thus expanding the very limited repertoire of the KATs that can be hijacked for inducing targeted protein acetylation. We also provide MS172, a valuable chemical biology tool and a potential therapeutic, to the scientific community to further investigate the role of p53Y220C acetylation in cancer.

    "full_text_abstract": "Abstract Pharmacological reactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 remains a key challenge for the treatment of cancer. Ace tylation Ta rgeting C himera (AceTAC), a novel technology is previously reported that hijacks lysine acetyltransferases p300/CBP to acetylate the p53Y220C mutant. However, p300/CBP are the only acetyltransferases harnessed for AceTAC development to date. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that the TAF1 acetyltransferase can be recruited to acetylate p53Y220C. A novel TAF1\u2010recruiting AceTAC, MS172 is discovered, which effectively acetylates p53Y220C lysine 382 in a concentration\u2010, time\u2010 and TAF1\u2010dependent manner via inducing the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1. Notably, MS172 suppresses the proliferation in multiple p53Y220C\u2010harboring cancer cell lines more potently than the previously reported p300/CBP\u2010recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC MS78 with little toxicity in p53 WT and normal cells. Additionally, MS172 is bioavailable in mice and suitable for in vivo efficacy studies. Lastly, novel upregulation of metallothionine proteins by MS172\u2010induced p53Y220C acetylation is discovered using RNA\u2010seq and RT\u2010qPCR studies. This work demonstrates that TAF1 can be harnessed for AceTAC development and expands the very limited repertoire of the acetyltransferases that can be leveraged for developing AceTACs, thus advancing the targeted protein acetylation field.\n\nA lysine acetyltransferase (KAT); can be harnessed for inducing targeted protein acetylation; In this study; it is demonstrated for the first time that TATA\u2010binding protein\u2010associated factor 1 (TAF1)."
