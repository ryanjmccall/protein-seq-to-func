  "abstract_text": "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Mutations in LMNA gene encoding two ubiquitously expressed nuclear proteins, lamins A and C, give rise to up to 7 different pathologies affecting specific tissues. Three of these disorders affect cardiac and/or skeletal muscles with atrio-ventricular conduction disturbances, dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death as common features.<h4>Results</h4>A new LMNA mutation (1621C>T, R541C) was found in two members of a French family with a history of ventricular rhythm disturbances and an uncommon form of systolic left ventricle dysfunction. The two patients: the proband and his daughter, were affected and exhibited an atypical form of dilated cardiomyopathy with an unexplained left ventricle aneurysm revealed by ventricular rhythm disturbances without atrio-ventricular block.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This finding reinforces the highly variable phenotypic expression of LMNA mutation and emphasizes the fact that LMNA mutations can be associated with different cardiac phenotypes.",
