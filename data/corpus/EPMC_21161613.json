  "abstract_text": "The promyeloctic leukemia protein PML is a tumor suppressor that was originally identified due to its involvement in the (15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia. While the majority of early research has focused upon the role of PML in the pathogenesis of leukemia, more recent evidence has identified important roles for PML in tissues outside the hemopoietic system, including the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we review recent literature on the role of PML in the CNS, with particular focus on the processes of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, and propose new lines of investigation.",
