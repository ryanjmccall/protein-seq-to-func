    "abstract_text": "We previously reported that high density lipoprotein (HDL) protects against the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) induced by artery wall cells causing these cells to produce pro-inflammatory molecules. We also reported that enzyme systems associated with HDL were responsible for this anti-inflammatory property of HDL. We now report studies comparing HDL before and during an acute phase response (APR) in both humans and a croton oil rabbit model. In rabbits, from the onset of APR the protective effect of HDL progressively decreased and was completely lost by day three. As serum amyloid A (SAA) levels in acute phase HDL (AP-HDL) increased, apo A-I levels decreased 73%. Concomitantly, paraoxonase (PON) and platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) levels in HDL declined 71 and 90%, respectively, from days one to three. After day three, there was some recovery of the protective effect of HDL. AP-HDL from human patients and rabbits but not normal or control HDL (C-HDL) exhibited increases in ceruloplasmin (CP). This increase in CP was not seen in acute phase VLDL or LDL. C-HDL incubated with purified CP and re-isolated (CP-HDL), lost its ability to inhibit LDL oxidation. Northern blot analyses demonstrated enhanced expression of MCP-1 in coculture cells treated with AP-HDL and CP-HDL compared to C-HDL. Enrichment of human AP-HDL with purified PON or PAF-AH rendered AP-HDL protective against LDL modification. We conclude that under basal conditions HDL serves an anti-inflammatory role but during APR displacement and/or exchange of proteins associated with HDL results in a pro-inflammatory molecule.",
