Stat5 is constitutively active in clinical prostate cancers but not in the normal human prostate epithelium.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of Stat5a/b in prostate cancer are unclear. The receptor-associated tyrosine kinase Jak2 is a known key activator of Stat5a/b in prostate cancer cells in response to ligand stimulation.
