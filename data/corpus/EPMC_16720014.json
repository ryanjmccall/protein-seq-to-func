SUMO attachment to its substrate proteins causes changes in the localization, activity, or binding partners of the substrate. SUMO has been shown to play a role in a multitude of processes; these include chromosome segregation, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage recovery. Defects in the SUMO pathway have been demonstrated to affect tumorigenesis and the inflammatory response as well as other human diseases.",
