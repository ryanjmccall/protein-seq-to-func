    "abstract_text": "Design, synthesis, and SAR of novel alpha-alkoxy-beta-arylpropionic acids as potent and balanced PPARalphagamma coagonists are described. One representative thereof, Aleglitazar ((S)-2Aa), was chosen for clinical development. Its X-ray structure in complex with both receptors as well as its high efficacy in animal models of T2D and dyslipidemia are also presented.",
