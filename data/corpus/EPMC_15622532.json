  "title": "p.S143F mutation in lamin A/C: a new phenotype combining myopathy and progeria.",
  "year": 2005,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/15622532",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "We report a young girl with a phenotype combining early-onset myopathy and a progeria. She had myopathy and marked axial weakness during the first year of life; progeroid features, including growth failure, sclerodermatous skin changes, and osteolytic lesions, developed later. We identified the underlying cause to be a hitherto unreported de novo missense mutation in the LMNA gene (S143F) encoding the nuclear envelope proteins lamins A and C. Although LMNA mutations have been known to cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, this is the first report of a patient combining features of these two phenotypes because of a single mutation in LMNA.",
