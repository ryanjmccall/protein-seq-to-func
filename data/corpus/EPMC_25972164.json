    "abstract_text": "The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger 1 (NCX1) is reduced in stroke by the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST), whereas it is increased in ischemic brain preconditioning (PC) by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Because ncx1 brain promoter (ncx1-Br) has five putative consensus sequences, named Sp1A-E, for the specificity protein (Sp) family of transcription factors (Sp1-4), we investigated the role of this family in regulating ncx1 transcription in rat cortical neurons. Here we found that Sp1 is a transcriptional activator, whereas Sp3 is a transcriptional repressor of ncx1, and that both bind ncx1-Br in a sequence-specific manner, modulating ncx1 transcription through the Sp1 sites C-E. Furthermore, by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats, the transcriptional repressors Sp3 and REST colocalized with the two histone-deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC2 on the ncx1-Br, with a consequent hypoacetylation. Contrarily, in PC+tMCAO the transcriptional activators Sp1 and HIF-1 colocalized with histone acetyltransferase p300 on ncx1-Br with a consequent hyperacetylation. In addition, in neurons silenced with siRNA of NCX1 and subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) (3 h) plus reoxygenation (RX) (24 h), the neuroprotection of Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 was counteracted, whereas in neurons overexpressing NCX1 and subjected to ischemic preconditioning (PC+OGD/RX), the neurotoxic effect of p300 inhibitor C646 was prevented. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NCX1 expression is regulated by the Sp3/REST/HDAC1/HDAC2 complex in tMCAO and by the Sp1/HIF-1/p300 complex in PC+tMCAO and that epigenetic intervention, by modulating the acetylation of ncx1-Br, may be a strategy for the development of innovative therapeutic intervention in stroke.",
