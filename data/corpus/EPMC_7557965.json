  "abstract_text": "Mutations in the common gamma chain (gamma c or IL2RG) of the interleukin-2, -4, -7, -9 and -15 receptors have been found to cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDX1). We report here on the mutations identified in a further ten families. Two of the mutations identified have occurred twice in unrelated families, indicating two possible mutational hotspots. Seven of the mutations, which were identified by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, are point mutations, and the eighth is a small deletion. We also report on the first use of assays based on these mutations within IL2RG for unambiguous carrier determination. The consequences for the gamma c proteins produced as a result of these mutations are discussed.",
