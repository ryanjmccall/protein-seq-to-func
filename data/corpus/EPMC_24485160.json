    "abstract_text": "<h4>Aim</h4>This report highlights the metabolic, endocrine and cardiovascular comorbidities in a case of familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), and also evaluates the efficacy and safety of metformin therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>Mutational analysis was carried out of the LMNA gene in a teenage girl with an FPLD phenotype. Insulin resistance, sex hormones and metabolic parameters were also evaluated, and echocardiography, electrocardiography and 24-h blood pressure monitoring were also done.<h4>Results</h4>The patient showed atypical fat distribution, insulin resistance and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Physical examination revealed muscle hypertrophy with a paucity of fat in the extremities, trunk and gluteal regions, yet excess fat deposits in the face, neck and dorsal cervical region. LMNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.1543A>G) in exon 9, leading to substitution of lysine by glutamic acid at position 515 (K515E). Moderate hypertension and secondary polycystic ovary syndrome were also assessed. Treatment with metformin resulted in progressive improvement of metabolic status, while blood pressure values normalized with atenolol therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Very rapid and good results with no side-effects were achieved with metformin therapy for FPLD. The association of an unusual mutation in the LMNA gene was also described.",
