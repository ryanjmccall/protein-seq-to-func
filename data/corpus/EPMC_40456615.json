Using global data, we show these variants correlate with severe calcification and frequently manifest as cognitive decline or psychiatric symptoms, while nearly a quarter of patients remain asymptomatic. By integrating genetic and clinical analyses, we provide the first systematic comparison of PFBC-associated genes and phenotypes, offering critical insights for diagnosis, genetic counseling, and mechanistic research. These findings highlight the need for expanded screening of understudied genes and global collaborations to address gaps in understanding this underdiagnosed condition, ultimately guiding therapeutic strategies for affected individuals. Introduction Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bilateral brain calcifications in the basal ganglia. In 1974, the term “idiopathic basal ganglia calcification” was first introduced to describe two cases of familial basal ganglia calcification, which presented with characteristics of “dystonic deformities” and unexplained brain calcification ( Caraceni et al., 1974 ). Over the following decades, studies on familial clusters suggested a potential genetic etiology for this idiopathic basal ganglia calcification ( Foley, 1951 ; Boller et al., 1977 ; Ellie et al., 1989 ). It was not until 2012, when the first dominant genetic factor, SLC20A2 , was identified ( Wang et al., 2012 ), that the genetic basis of PFBC was firmly established. PFBC is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern ( Guo et al., 2019 ), and to date, four dominant pathogenic genes have been identified: SLC20A2 ( Wang et al., 2012 ), PDGFRB ( Nicolas et al., 2013b ), PDGFB ( Keller et al., 2013 ), and XPR1 ( Legati et al., 2015 ). In recent years, four recessive pathogenic genes, MYORG ( Yao et al., 2018 ), JAM2 ( Cen et al., 2020 ), CMPK2 ( Zhao et al., 2022 ), and NAA60 ( Chelban et al., 2024 ), have also been discovered. Among these, the role of CMPK2 in PFBC pathogenesis has not been independently replicated, and its potential as a causative gene remains under debate. The clinical phenotype of PFBC is heterogeneous, encompassing motor disturbances, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and, in a significant proportion of cases, the absence of obvious symptoms ( Manyam et al., 2001 ; Nicolas et al., 2015 ; Tadic et al., 2015 ). Disease onset can occur at any age, although more than half of patients typically develop symptoms between the ages of 30 and 50 years ( Nicolas et al., 2015 ). Currently, PFBC diagnosis is supported by the detection of brain calcifications through computed tomography (CT) scans, with confirmation through the identification of pathogenic variants in one of these eight PFBC-associated genes ( Legati et al., 2015 ; Westenberger et al., 2019 ). While traditionally considered rare, recent population-based genomic analyses suggest PFBC is more common than previously thought, though frequently underdiagnosed ( Nicolas et al., 2018 ). Epidemiological inference based on genetic screening suggests an overall prevalence of PFBC of up to 0.66% ( Chen et al., 2019 ). Therefore, the impact of PFBC on global health needs to be further emphasized. Previous studies have indicated that among the known PFBC-associated genes, variants in SLC20A2 are the most common, accounting for ∼40% of familial cases ( David et al., 2016 ). SLC20A2 encodes the transmembrane sodium-inorganic phosphate cotransporter PiT-2, which plays a crucial role in phosphate clearance from cerebrospinal fluid ( Jensen et al., 2016 ). Additionally, XPR1 is also implicated in phosphate transport, with functional studies showing that variants in XPR1 severely impair its membrane localization and phosphate efflux activity ( Legati et al., 2015 ; Anheim et al., 2016 ). The loss of NAA60 function may also reduce extracellular phosphate uptake by impairing the cell membrane expression of the SLC20A2 gene ( Chelban et al., 2024 ). In addition to pathophysiological factors related to phosphate metabolism disorders, genes encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGF-Rβ) and its ligand ( PDGFB and PDGFRB ), as well as recessive pathogenic genes MYORG and JAM2 , may compromise blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity by damaging the neurovascular unit (NVU). Increased BBB permeability could allow high concentrations of phosphate in the blood to infiltrate the brain, ultimately contributing to calcification ( Xu et al., 2023 ). Given the rapid progress in PFBC research and its associated pathogenic genes, understanding trends and advancements in this field is crucial. However, there remains a lack of systematic assessments and comparisons regarding the variant detection rates, severity, and age of onset of different PFBC-related pathogenic genes in patients with brain calcifications. Furthermore, there is insufficient evaluation of the prevalence of clinical phenotypes in PFBC patients, as well as a comprehensive review of past research on PFBC and its associated pathogenic genes. Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps in the literature by conducting a meta-analysis, incorporating bibliometric perspectives, to identify key research trends and hotspots in PFBC, as well as to determine the variant detection rates of PFBC-related genes in patients with brain calcifications and the phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patients. Materials and Methods Search strategy Two researchers systematically searched studies published up until December 31, 2024, in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, with no language restrictions. The search was performed using the following keyword combination: (“calcification” OR PFBC OR IBGC OR “Fahr disease”) AND ( SLC20A2 OR PDGFRB OR PDGFB OR XPR1 OR MYORG OR JAM2 OR CMPK2 OR NAA60 ). References from relevant systematic or narrative reviews identified in the search were also screened for additional studies. Given the need for citation databases in bibliometric analysis, and the inability to integrate other databases ( Archambault et al., 2009 ; Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017 ), the bibliometric analysis was limited to studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), specifically the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Bibliometric data were exported as “plain text” files containing full records and references. Selection criteria For bibliometric analysis, we included all studies from the WOSCC database related to the pathogenic genes of PFBC with available bibliometric data. Studies such as letters, conference abstracts, corrigenda, and editorials were excluded. For the meta-analysis, we included studies that performed gene sequencing and screening in patients with brain calcifications identified by imaging features, reporting variants in at least one of the following genes: SLC20A2 , PDGFRB , PDGFB , XPR1 , MYORG , JAM2 , CMPK2 , and NAA60 . Studies were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (1) animal studies; (2) case reports, series with fewer than 15 cases, or reviews; (3) duplicate studies from the same population; and (4) missing or uncalculable key outcome data. When multiple publications reported on the same population, we included the publication with the largest sample size, longest follow-up period, or most comprehensive study outcomes. The studies were selected independently by two researchers, with disagreements resolved by consulting a third author. Bibliometric analysis We recorded information including the title, institution, source (journal or book), authors, references, subject area, and keywords using Microsoft Excel. Analysis was performed using the “bibliometrix” package in R version 4.3.1 ( Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017 ) and CiteSpace software (version 6.2.R2 Basic). Indicators such as Total Citation (TC), Local Citation (LC), Normalized Total Citation (NTC), Normalized Local Citation (NLC), Average Article Citation (AAC), Articles Fractionalized (AF), and the H-index were applied to evaluate the impact and research output of countries, journals, authors, or studies. Meta-analysis The meta-analysis was conducted following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines ( Stroup et al., 2000 ). Two researchers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted relevant data from all included studies, including the title, first author's name, publication year, country or region of the study population, sample size, study type, gene sequencing method, number of screened patients, genes screened, number of patients with identified gene variants, total calcification score (TCS), age at disease onset, disease phenotypes, and the number of occurrences for each phenotype. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through consensus. The methodological quality of cross-sectional studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist ( Zeng et al., 2015 ), which evaluates eight dimensions, each rated as Yes, Unclear, No, or Not Applicable. A study was considered high quality if at least six “Yes” responses were obtained with no “No” responses. Additionally, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS; Stang, 2010 ) was used to assess the methodological quality of cohort and case–control studies, with a score of ≥7 considered high quality. A follow-up period longer than 2 years was considered sufficiently long. All quality assessments were performed independently by two researchers, with discrepancies resolved through consensus and the involvement of a third researcher. The primary outcome of this study was the variant detection rate of variants in SLC20A2 , PDGFRB , PDGFB , XPR1 , MYORG , JAM2 , CMPK2 , and NAA60 in patients with brain calcifications. The variant rate was calculated based on unrelated families and probands, with no repeated participants. Secondary outcomes included the age of onset, severity of brain calcification, and the prevalence of phenotypes in PFBC patients. The severity of brain calcification was assessed using the TCS score. Our classification of disease phenotypes was based on the descriptions reported in the included studies and was divided into Headache, Cognitive Disorder, Movement Disorder, Mental Symptom, Dysarthria, and Asymptomatic. These phenotypes were accurately defined in the original studies, from which detailed information can be obtained. We used a random-effects model to pool outcome data and calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochrane's Q test and the I 2 statistic, with I 2 values exceeding 50 and 75% considered moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively ( Higgins et al., 2003 ). For outcomes related to the severity of brain calcification, we performed subgroup analyses based on the mutated gene and used the Z -test to assess intergroup differences. Egger's linear regression test was used to evaluate publication bias ( Egger et al., 1997 ). A Baujat plot was employed to explore sources of heterogeneity further ( Baujat et al., 2002 ). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the “leave-one-out” method to assess the robustness of the pooled results ( Deeks et al., 2019 ). In all statistical analyses, a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses for the meta-analysis were performed using the meta package in R version 4.3.1. Results Bibliometric characteristics A total of 320 publications were identified through the WOSCC database. After excluding 96 studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 224 studies were included in the bibliometric analysis ( Fig. 1 ). The publications spanned the years 2012–2024. Among these studies, 193 were original articles (86.16%) and 31 were reviews (13.84%), involving 1,551 authors, 400 keywords, 4,168 references, and 113 sources (journals or books). On average, each article was cited 24.82 times, and each article was written by 10.5 authors. International collaborative research accounted for 28.12% of the total publications. The average annual growth rate of publications in this field was 18.06%. Figure 1. Flow diagram including reasons for exclusion of full-text articles. In the research area of PFBC-related gene variants, publication frequency analysis, including co-authors, revealed that China and France had the highest publication rates, while there was a notable lack of research from the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. Additionally, studies from France had the highest citation rates ( Fig. 2 A ). The analysis of interregional collaborations showed that the highest collaboration frequencies occurred between the United States, Brazil, and France, highlighting the dominant role of the United States in international cooperation ( Fig. 2 B ). Driven by global research efforts, the number of publications and citations in this field has shown a steady increase year by year ( Fig. 2 C ). Figure 2. Information of regions on relevant research. A , Distribution of regions contributing to the field. B , Regions’ collaboration world map. C , Trends in the number of publications and citations. The study by Wang et al. (2012) in 2012, titled “Variants in SLC20A2 link familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification with phosphate homeostasis,” had the highest TC and LC. In contrast, the 2018 study by Yao et al. (2018) in Neuron , titled “Biallelic variants in MYORG cause autosomal recessive primary familial brain calcification”, had the highest NTC and NLC. These two studies are the most influential in the field, representing the discovery of the first dominant and recessive genetic variants associated with PFBC, respectively, and have made significant contributions to research on PFBC-related genetic variants ( Table 1 ). Dr. Nicolas has the highest h-index, publication volume, TC, and LC, indicating the greatest influence in this field. The top 20 most influential authors maintain a relatively stable annual publication rate, with articles published in 2013 and 2015 receiving the most citations ( Fig. 3 ). Regarding the sources of publications, the Journal of Molecular Neuroscience published the largest number of articles on PFBC, while Nature Genetics had the highest TC and Scientific Reports had the highest h-index. Among all source journals, the 11 journals with the highest publication volumes, including the Journal of Molecular Neuroscience , were identified as core journals according to Bradford's Law ( Weinstock, 1971 ).

Co-occurrence and co-citation statistics In the co-occurrence network analysis of keywords, all keywords were divided into five major clusters. Among these, “primary familial brain calcification” and “ SLC20A2 ” had the largest node sizes and betweenness centrality, indicating the strongest co-occurrence and making them the most important keywords. Notably, other related genes, such as “ PDGFRB ,” “ MYORG ,” “ XPR1 ,” and “ JAM2 ,” as well as phenotypic traits like “dementia” and “parkinsonism,” also exhibited significant node sizes ( Fig. 4 A ). In the co-citation network analysis of all studies, articles were divided into two major clusters. The articles by Nicolas, Keller, and Wang had the largest node sizes, indicating strong co-citation relationships between these studies ( Fig. 4 B ). Figure 4. Co-occurrence and network analysis.

Specifically, the labels represented different research subjects covered by the journals. Different colored lines correspond to the different paths of references, starting from the citing journals (left half) to the cited journals (right half). The main citing journals were shown in the blue box and the main cited journals were shown in the green box. In the network analysis of institutional collaborations, the institution with the highest activity in related research was the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). The highest co-occurrence rate was observed between INSERM and the University of Rouen Normandy, indicating broad collaboration between these two institutions. Additionally, Zhejiang University in China exhibited the highest betweenness centrality, while Gifu Pharmaceutical University and Gifu University in Japan had the highest closeness centrality, making them key institutions in facilitating collaboration within the field ( Fig. 4 C ). The dual-map overlay analysis of citing and cited journals revealed the disciplinary distribution of these journals. The left half of the map represents citing journals, while the right half represents cited journals. The colored lines represent citations and show the relationship between citing and cited journal articles. The results indicated that one of the primary citation pathways in PFBC-related research is from Molecular Biology & Genetics (cited journals) to Molecular Biology & Immunology (citing journals), highlighting the continued focus on basic research. “Genetics,” “Immunology,” and “Molecular Biology” remain core areas of focus, while the clinical translational significance of PFBC-related research requires further exploration ( Fig. 4 D ). Study characteristics of meta-analysis Based on the bibliometric analysis, a total of 1,267 records were identified through database and manual searches. After determining the eligibility of the studies for full-text review, 81 studies were assessed, and following a detailed evaluation, 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis ( Fig. 1 ). These studies, published between 2013 and 2021, spanned six regions, five PFBC-related genes, and six types of PFBC-related clinical phenotypes ( Table 2 ). A quality assessment of the methodologies of the 12 cross-sectional studies ( Chen et al., 2013 ; Baker et al., 2014 ; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2014 ; Nicolas et al., 2015 ; Anheim et al., 2016 ; David et al., 2016 ; Gebus et al., 2017 ; Ramos et al., 2018 ; Giorgio et al., 2019 ; Grangeon et al., 2019 ; Chelban et al., 2020 ; Kurita et al., 2021 ), two case–control studies( Nicolas et al., 2013a ; Hozumi et al., 2018 ), and four cohort studies( Hsu et al., 2013 ; Chen et al., 2019 , 2020 ; Guo et al., 2019 ) included in the meta-analysis was performed ( Table 3 ). All included studies were of high quality, with two case–control studies receiving a score of 9 on the NOS scale. Table 2.

Detection rate of PFBC-related gene variants Thirteen studies screened for variants in the SLC20A2 gene region. The random-effects model indicated that 16.7% (95% CI: 10.0–24.6, I 2 = 86%) of patients exhibited genetic variants in the SLC20A2 gene region. Eight studies screened the PDGFRB gene region, finding 4.3% (95% CI: 0.4–11.3, I 2 = 92%) of patients with variants in this region. Seven studies focused on the PDGFB gene region, with 3.3% (95% CI: 0.0–11.0, I 2 = 91%) of patients exhibiting variants. Five studies analyzed the XPR1 gene region, reporting a variant rate of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.0–2.4, I 2 = 57%). Three studies assessed the MYORG gene region, revealing a variant rate of 16.8% (95% CI: 0.0–54.0, I 2 = 96%; Fig. 5 ). Egger's linear regression analysis suggested no significant publication bias ( p > 0.05). Figure 5. Forest plots of primary outcome in meta-analysis. A , SLC20A2 variant detection rate combined result. B , PDGFRB variant detection rate combined result. C , PDGFB variant detection rate combined result. D , XPR1 variant detection rate combined result. E , MYORG variant detection rate combined result. Except for the five studies reporting variants in the XPR1 gene, which exhibited moderate heterogeneity, the other four outcomes displayed high heterogeneity. The Baujat plot indicated that the studies by Gebus et al. (2017) , Chen et al. (2019) , Nicolas et al. (2015) , and four studies by Chen et al. (2019) were the primary sources of heterogeneity for the studies on SLC20A2 , PDGFRB , PDGFB , and MYORG , respectively. However, sensitivity analysis using the “leave-one-out” method showed that the combined results were robust, as excluding any single study did not significantly alter the outcomes. Phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patients Eight studies reported TCS scores for PFBC patients. The random-effects model showed that patients with variants in the PDGFB gene region had an average TCS score of 13.99 (95% CI: 5.10–22.87, I 2 = 81%), while patients with variants in the SLC20A2 gene region had an average TCS score of 33.72 (95% CI: 25.01–42.42, I 2 = 95%). Patients with variants in the MYORG gene region had an average TCS score of 35.06 (95% CI: 24.00–46.12, I 2 = 56%). Z -test results showed significant differences in TCS scores between different genes ( p < 0.01), with patients harboring variants in the XPR1 (7.30, 95%CI: 2.03–12.57) and PDGFRB (13.99, 95%CI: 5.10–22.87) region exhibiting lower TCS scores compared with those with variants in other genes, although only one study reported TCS score data for the XPR1 gene and thus the random-effects model could not be used for pooling. Except for the MYORG gene region, which showed moderate heterogeneity, the other studies demonstrated considerable heterogeneity ( Fig. 6 A ). Additionally, 10 studies reported the onset age of PFBC symptoms. The random-effects model indicated that the average age of onset for PFBC patients was 43.69 years (95% CI: 36.17–51.21, I 2 = 98%; Fig. 6 B ). Figure 6.

In the meta-analysis of various clinical phenotypes in PFBC patients, the random-effects model indicated the following prevalence rates: headache occurred in 26.4% (95% CI: 15.5–38.8, I 2 = 71%) of patients ( Fig. 6 C ); cognitive impairment was present in 45.3% (95% CI: 35.7–55.1, I 2 = 67%; Fig. 6 D ); movement disorders were observed in 26.4% (95% CI: 16.2–37.8, I 2 = 88%; Fig. 6 E ); psychiatric symptoms were observed in 30.8% (95% CI: 17.2–46.2, I 2 = 81%; Fig. 6 F ); dysarthria were observed in 25.5% (95% CI: 13.3–39.8, I 2 = 71%; Fig. 6 G ); and asymptomatic cases were observed in 23.5% (95% CI: 12.7–36.1, I 2 = 86%; Fig. 6 H ). Egger's linear regression analysis indicated no significant publication bias ( p > 0.05). Except for headache, cognitive impairment, and speech disorder phenotypes, which showed moderate heterogeneity, the remaining outcomes exhibited high heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis using the “leave-one-out” method confirmed that the combined results were robust and unaffected by the exclusion of any individual study. Discussion This integrative analysis identifies SLC20A2 and MYORG as predominant genetic contributors to PFBC, with distinct neuropsychiatric manifestations (cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms) representing hallmark clinical features. The mid-adult disease onset pattern reinforces PFBC's characterization as a neurodegenerative disorder with presymptomatic calcification progression. These findings position SLC20A2 and MYORG variants as critical molecular markers while underscoring the need to disentangle mechanisms underlying its striking phenotypic heterogeneity. In the keyword network analysis, SLC20A2 exhibited the largest node area among all related genes. Moreover, in the meta-analysis, variants associated with SLC20A2 showed the highest detection rates, and patients carrying these variants had significantly higher TCS scores. The pathogenic effect of SLC20A2 variants remains unclear, but one possible explanation is that variants in SLC20A2 disrupt the normal function of PiT-2, leading to phosphate homeostasis imbalance. This causes excessive phosphate absorption by brain cells, particularly astrocytes, resulting in calcium phosphate crystal deposition in brain tissue. These calcifications can accumulate in various regions of the brain, including the basal ganglia ( Wallingford et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2023 ). The XPR1 gene also contributes to pathogenesis by directly impairing phosphate transport in brain cells and inhibiting the storage of phosphate by suppressing the intracellular accumulation of polyphosphates ( Mailer et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2023 ). In addition, in our meta-analysis we observed that XPR1 was associated with lower TCS scores. The differential impact of XPR1 and SLC20A2 variants on calcification severity may stem from their distinct roles in phosphate homeostasis. Although both genes encode phosphate transporters, SLC20A2 (PiT-2) mediates constitutive cellular phosphate uptake across the blood–brain barrier and the choroid plexus ( Jensen et al., 2016 ), thereby directly affecting the clearance of phosphate from the cerebrospinal fluid. Consequently, complete loss-of-function mutations in SLC20A2 may result in systemic phosphate dysregulation, predisposing patients to widespread calcification. In contrast, XPR1 primarily regulates phosphate efflux via its plasma membrane localization, functioning as a “phosphate sensor” that modulates cellular output through a feedback mechanism ( Legati et al., 2015 ; Anheim et al., 2016 ). This functional specialization suggests that XPR1 variants may retain partial phosphate efflux capacity through residual transporter activity or compensatory pathways, thereby potentially limiting the calcification burden. In addition to the phosphate metabolism pathway, some studies suggest that the pathogenic effects of variants in other genes may be related to damage to the NVU. The NVU, as the smallest functional unit of the brain, plays a crucial role in regulating cerebral blood flow and maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Dysfunction of the NVU can disrupt normal exchanges of substances between the blood and brain parenchyma. If the BBB is compromised, increased permeability may allow high concentrations of phosphate in the blood to infiltrate the brain, with PDGFRB , PDGFB , MYORG , and JAM2 genes potentially affecting BBB integrity ( Xu et al., 2023 ). The dominant genes PDGFB / PDGFRB , which function as a ligand–receptor pair, help maintain neurovascular unit stability by regulating pericyte recruitment; the associated calcification phenotype may be related to local BBB disruption in the basal ganglia ( Keller et al., 2013 ; Nicolas et al., 2013b ). In contrast, the recessive genes MYORG and JAM2 impair the BBB through different mechanisms: MYORG regulates the astrocyte-mediated transport of endothelial tight junction proteins ( Yao et al., 2018 ), while JAM2 , being closely associated with tight junctions, directly maintains the integrity of the paracellular barrier ( Yang et al., 2025 ). It is noteworthy that both “NVU” and “PiT-2” also appear as important nodes in the keyword network, marking significant directions for future research. According to the results of the meta-analysis, the prevalence of cognitive disorders among PFBC patients was found to be the highest (45.3%) among all clinical phenotypes, followed by psychiatric disorders (30.8%). In the keyword network, “dementia” was also identified as an important node. One possible explanation for this is that excessive extracellular phosphate can lead to tissue toxicity ( Hong et al., 2015 ) and neuroinflammation ( Brown, 2020 ), which in turn damages surrounding brain tissue and impairs normal brain functions, causing common neurological and psychiatric symptoms in PFBC patients, such as memory loss, mood swings, and behavioral abnormalities ( Suescun et al., 2019 ; Dunn et al., 2020 ). Additionally, “Parkinsonism” was also an important node in the keyword network. Although our results show that the prevalence of movement disorders was relatively low, the majority of studies in the meta-analysis reported on the occurrence of movement disorders, making this an important focus in PFBC research. Movement disorders may arise from motor neuron damage, abnormal neural conduction, or lesions in specific brain regions caused by brain calcification, especially when neural pathways between the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex are affected. While this symptom is relatively rare among PFBC patients, when present, it significantly impacts the quality of life. Therefore, movement disorders remain an important area of concern in clinical research on PFBC and should be prioritized in early screening and clinical evaluation of the disease. It is also worth noting that the meta-analysis observed that approximately one-fifth of PFBC patients were asymptomatic, while another one-fifth reported headaches, which is consistent with the rate of asymptomatic cases reported in a 2015 systematic review ( Tadic et al., 2015 ). The genetic features of PFBC exhibit incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals carrying pathogenic variants will present with clinical symptoms. This incomplete penetrance may be related to variant type, the functional impact of the variants, and the timing of gene expression. Additionally, with advancing age, PFBC symptoms may gradually manifest, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration. Early carriers may not exhibit noticeable clinical signs due to their younger age or early physiological stage. As they age, the cumulative effects of brain calcification and neurodegenerative changes may promote the onset of clinical symptoms. Lastly, gene interactions, compensatory mechanisms, and gene–environment interactions may also influence the phenotypes of variant carriers. Certain carriers may have genetic interactions that are not yet fully understood, which could partially or fully compensate for the negative effects of the pathogenic variant, thereby preventing the appearance of symptoms. The heterogeneity of PFBC clinical phenotypes presents a challenge for clinical diagnosis and disease screening. Some asymptomatic variant carriers may only develop symptoms later due to specific environmental or physiological triggers, emphasizing the need for more research to support early screening and monitoring for PFBC. In most of the outcomes from the meta-analyses, significant statistical heterogeneity was observed between studies. This variability may be attributed to differences in study populations, as the ratio of sporadic to familial cases varies across studies. Additionally, methodological heterogeneity in gene sequencing protocols contributes to the variability. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) method is more robust and less prone to missing variants compared with whole exome sequencing (WES; Belkadi et al., 2015 ). This suggests that future research should prioritize WGS when possible. The Baujat plot identified the study by Chen et al. in 2019 ( Chen et al., 2019 ) as the primary source of heterogeneity, as it reported lower variant detection rates for PDGFRB compared with other studies. This study employed a retrospective cohort design, categorizing patients into a “systemic group” and a “nonsystemic group.” The “systemic group” consisted of 37 probands diagnosed at the Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, while the “nonsystemic group” comprised 236 probands with cerebral calcification identified by imaging at other study centers. Patients with PFBC in the systemic group were ultimately diagnosed through outpatient clinics due to the presence of neurological symptoms, whereas those in the nonsystemic group were identified with calcification through imaging examinations and did not necessarily have neurological symptoms. It is possible that by including more asymptomatic individuals, this has expanded the study population to a certain extent, thereby introducing heterogeneity. It should be noted that, in addition to study design, the ratio of sporadic to familial cases included may also contribute to the high heterogeneity. For example, in the included studies, the research by Gebus et al. ( Gebus et al., 2017 ) consisted solely of sporadic cases, which significantly differed from other studies ( Table 2 ). Sporadic cases may be subject to substantial selection bias at the time of inclusion, with some sporadic patients potentially being overlooked due to atypical symptoms. For this reason, that study became the primary source of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of SLC20A2 detection rates. Our study offers several advantages. First, it is the first meta-analysis to focus on the variant detection rates of various genes and the prevalence of different phenotypes in brain calcification patients. Additionally, we incorporated bibliometric perspectives by quantitatively exploring the characteristics and trends of the studies, and we used a random-effects model to combine the relevant outcomes. Second, we conducted a systematic search of databases and comprehensively included all 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria, all of which exhibited high methodological quality. Despite the high heterogeneity in some outcomes, no significant publication bias was detected between studies, and sensitivity analysis suggested robust results. Lastly, our bibliometric analysis was based on the WOSCC database, which includes complete citation networks for high-quality literature, ensuring the data's quality and authority ( Wang and Waltman, 2016 ; Yeung, 2019 ). However, there are several limitations to our study. First, although we used various methods, such as the Baujat plot and “leave-one-out” analysis, to explore the sources of heterogeneity, the exact sources of heterogeneity between studies have not been fully elucidated. Due to the limited number of studies included for each outcome, we were unable to perform meta-regression for further investigation. Additionally, some early studies did not differentiate between primary and secondary brain calcification, and there is a lack of studies from the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. A higher representation of affected individuals in the studies may introduce selection bias, making the combined results less generalizable to other populations. Secondly, certain outcomes were based on a limited number of studies, such as those reporting MYORG variant detection rates and the prevalence of dysarthria phenotypes, which were derived from only three studies, potentially compromising the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, as JAM2 and CMPK2 were discovered later, no studies meeting the inclusion criteria were available for these genes. Earlier identified genes, such as SLC20A2 , may introduce estimation bias due to the relatively higher number of reports, leading to higher variant detection rates and TCS scores. Some potential PFBC pathogenic genes have not yet been discovered, and the detection rates of these undiscovered genes in the calcification population cannot be determined. Finally, due to design limitations, we were unable to compare calcification scores and the incidence rates of asymptomatic patients with age, despite evidence suggesting that the clinical expressivity of calcification correlates with age. Our study has significant clinical implications. First, it provides a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and research trends associated with PFBC, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of human brain function and neurodegenerative diseases. Clinically, our findings have implications for diagnosis and genetic counseling and provide valuable reference points for assessing prognosis and treatment outcomes. Genetic screening can be used to aid the diagnosis of brain calcification patients, in conjunction with common clinical phenotypic features of PFBC, improving diagnostic accuracy and enhancing patients’ quality of life. Future research should focus on variants related to JAM2 , CMPK2 , and NAA60 , using more clinical data for validation, especially as the pathogenic effect of CMPK2 on PFBC has yet to be independently replicated by other research groups. Further studies should also aim to expand the sample size and geographic scope, explore other potential pathogenic genes and variants, and analyze the associations and differences between different genotypes and phenotypes. Additionally, although current PFBC-related research is concentrated in China and France, it is essential to investigate pathogenic gene variants in brain calcification patients from other regions worldwide. Collaborative efforts between regional research institutions are needed to promote global research in this field. Finally, considering that current research focuses primarily on basic medical disciplines, and the keyword network shows a higher focus on “case report” type studies, future research could explore individual cases to identify potential therapeutic targets and emphasize clinical translational significance. The highly cited literature summarized in our study can provide valuable guidance. Conclusion In PFBC patients, the SLC20A2 and MYORG genes exhibit higher variant detection rates and tend to have higher TCS scores. Additionally, cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptom phenotypes have a higher prevalence in PFBC patients compared with other phenotypes, with ∼23.5% of patients remaining asymptomatic. Research on the genetic variants associated with PFBC has generated several hot topics. Institutions and researchers from different countries need to establish connections for more in-depth studies on the pathogenic mechanisms, clinical translation, and treatment of PFBC.

  "plain_text": "The genetic role and specific effects of primary familial cerebral calcification (PFBC) are still unclear. We aim to analyze bibliometric features in studies related to PFBC, investigate variant detection rates in patients with brain calcifications, and examine the phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patients. A comprehensive search of studies on the genetic effects of PFBC up until December 31, 2024, was conducted across Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. A random-effects meta-analysis combined variant detection rates for genes SLC20A2 , PDGFRB , PDGFB , XPR1 , MYORG , JAM2 , CMPK2 , and NAA60 . Data on total calcification scores (TCS), age of onset, and the prevalence of various phenotypes in PFBC patients were also aggregated. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's linear regression, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed. Of 1,267 records, 224 were included in the bibliometric analysis. Keywords “primary familial brain calcification” and “ SLC20A2 ” were most prominent. Eighteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, revealing higher variant rates for SLC20A2 (16.7%, 95% CI: 10.0–24.6) and MYORG (16.8%, 95% CI: 0.0–54.0), which were associated with higher TCS. The average age of onset was 43.69 years (95% CI: 36.17–51.21). Cognitive impairment (45.3%, 95% CI: 35.7–55.1) and psychiatric symptoms (30.8%, 95% CI: 17.2–46.2) had relatively higher prevalence rates. No significant publication bias was found ( p > 0.05), and the sensitivity analysis confirmed the results’ robustness. SLC20A2 and MYORG variants had higher detection rates, with cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms being common in PFBC patients. Continued research is essential to further explore these genetic variants."
