  "abstract_text": "1. Abundant senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in certain brain regions constitute the major neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Recent work has established that the amyloid beta protein, which is derived from a large precursor, constitutes the major constituent of plaque amyloid, whereas the microtubule-associated protein tau is a component of the paired helical filament, the major constituent of neurofibrillary tangles. 2. Multiple isoforms of amyloid beta protein precursor and tau protein are produced from a single gene through alternative RNA splicing. By Northern blotting amyloid beta protein precursor transcripts are found throughout central and peripheral tissues, whereas tau protein transcripts are only found in the nervous system. 3. In the central nervous system the cellular localization of amyloid beta protein precursor and tau protein transcripts is neuronal. The cells affected in Alzheimer's disease patients produce both types of transcripts; however, the various transcripts are also found in cells not affected in the course of the disease. At present, there exists no evidence to suggest that an overproduction of amyloid beta protein precursor or tau protein is the reason for plaque and tangle formation. The formation of the latter probably results from posttranslational events.",
