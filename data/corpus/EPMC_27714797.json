    "abstract_text": "The interaction of the rhomboid pseudoprotease Derlin-1 and p97 is crucial for the retrotranslocation of polyubiquitinated substrates in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. We report a 2.25 \u00c5 resolution structure of the p97 N-terminal domain (p97N) in complex with the Derlin-1 SHP motif. Remarkably, the SHP motif adopts a short, antiparallel \u03b2-strand that interacts with the \u03b2-sheet of p97N-a site distinct from that to which most p97 adaptor proteins bind. Mutational and biochemical analyses contributed to defining the specific interaction, demonstrating the importance of a highly conserved binding pocket on p97N and a signature motif on SHP. Our findings may also provide insights into the interactions between other SHP-containing proteins and p97N.",
