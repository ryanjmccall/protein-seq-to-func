  "abstract_text": "Thioredoxin (Trx) has recently been demonstrated to be an essential component of the early pregnancy factor activity of pregnancy serum. Here, we report the structure and sequence of human Trx-encoding genes (Trx) by analysis of genomic clones. The Trx gene extends over 13 kb and consists of five exons encoding a 12-kDa protein. A 700-bp fragment upstream from the start codon functions as a promoter when inserted in front of a human growth hormone-encoding reporter gene in tissue-culture cells. This promoter region is very G + C rich and does not contain a classical TATA or CCAAT box, but has three consensus sequences for high-affinity Sp1 binding. Southern analysis demonstrated the presence of several Trx genes in the human genome. The number includes at least one inactive copy as shown by the isolation and sequencing of an inactive pseudogene.",
