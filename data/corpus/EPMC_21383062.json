    "abstract_text": "Class I(A) phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are heterodimeric enzymes composed of a p85 regulatory and a p110 catalytic subunit that induce the formation of 3-polyphosphoinositides, which mediate cell survival, division, and migration. There are two ubiquitous PI3K isoforms p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 that have nonredundant functions in embryonic development and cell division. However, whereas p110\u03b1 concentrates in the cytoplasm, p110\u03b2 localizes to the nucleus and modulates nuclear processes such as DNA replication and repair. At present, the structural features that determine p110\u03b2 nuclear localization remain unknown. We describe here that association with the p85\u03b2 regulatory subunit controls p110\u03b2 nuclear localization. We identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in p110\u03b2 C2 domain that mediates its nuclear entry, as well as a nuclear export sequence (NES) in p85\u03b2. Deletion of p110\u03b2 induced apoptosis, and complementation with the cytoplasmic C2-NLS p110\u03b2 mutant was unable to restore cell survival. These studies show that p110\u03b2 NLS and p85\u03b2 NES regulate p85\u03b2/p110\u03b2 nuclear localization, supporting the idea that nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, p110\u03b2 controls cell survival.",
