  "abstract_text": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) of the breast is rare. Late and painful local recurrence of this entity on this site is even more uncommon. We describe such a case in a 102-year-old woman, who at the age of 77 years had been operated for a breast lump for which only a cytopathological diagnosis of fibrohistiocytic tumour was available. Twenty years later, she noticed a small mass in her right breast over the postsurgical scar area, which gradually increased in size over the last five years. She presented to the surgical out-patient clinic with pain and redness over the swelling. Wide local excision of the tumor with generous tissue margin was performed under intercostal block on account of her age and suboptimal cardiac status. The microscopic and immunohistochemical findings established the diagnosis of recurrent DFSP. We report an exceptionally rare case of local recurrence of DFSP in the female breast and discuss in detail the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this pathology.",
