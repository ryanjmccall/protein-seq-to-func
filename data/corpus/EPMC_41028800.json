These secondary metabolites including alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids and polyphenols exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activities such as antidiabetic, anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects 3 , 4 . Consequently, traditional medicinal plants continue to play a significant role in public health and the global pharmaceutical market. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that approximately 60% of the global population relies on plant-based treatments. Especially, countries such as India, China, and Egypt, retain herbal medicine integral to their healthcare systems 5 \u2013 7 . The Cucurbitaceae family, the second largest family of fruits and vegetables after Solanaceae, includes around 960 species across 115 genera. It includes numerous globally and locally important crops such as Cucumis sativus (cucumber), Cucurbita maxima (pumpkin), Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd), and Momordica charantia (bitter gourd), which are well known for their nutritional and medicinal properties 8 . Among these, Momordica cymbalaria commonly known as Athalakkai in Tamil is a lesser-known, tuber-forming species indigenous to the Western and Eastern Ghats of India. It is traditionally cultivated in southern Indian states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka, and has been used in folk medicine for managing ailments such as diabetes, ulcers, rheumatism, and infections 9 , 10 . Despite its ethnobotanical significance, M. cymbalaria remains understudied at the molecular level, with no genomic or transcriptomic datasets currently available. However, phytochemical analyses have revealed the presence of valuable bioactive compounds, with flavonoids, triterpenes, sterols, alkaloids, and glycosides, in its fruit, tubers, and leaves 10 \u2013 13 . These findings strongly suggest that the plant holds unexplored therapeutic and metabolic potential, especially for conditions like diabetes mellitus, cancer, and oxidative stress-related disorders (Fig. 1 A, B). Unlocking the biosynthetic basis of these compounds requires a genomic-level understanding of the plant\u2019s gene expression profile. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, particularly RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), have revolutionized transcriptome analysis in non-model plants. RNA-Seq enables high-throughput profiling of gene expression across different tissues and developmental stages, revealing genes involved in secondary metabolism, stress responses, and developmental regulation 14 . Importantly, transcriptome data can support functional annotation, gene discovery, and pathway reconstruction, offering insights into the molecular machinery underlying medicinal properties. Given the complete lack of molecular data for M. cymbalaria , such an approach is both timely and necessary. The objective of this study is to generate a high-quality de novo transcriptome of M. cymbalaria by sequencing cDNA libraries from leaf, mature fruit, and seed tissues using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (Fig. 1 C). Through transcriptome assembly, functional annotation, and pathway analysis, we identified crucial genes associated with the biosynthetic pathways of pharmacologically important metabolites, including terpenoids, steroids, ubiquinones, and isoquinoline alkaloids. We further validate selected gene expression profiles using qRT-PCR. This study represents the first transcriptomic resource for M. cymbalaria and provides a platform for future molecular, pharmacological, and biotechnological research on this underutilized medicinal plant. Fig. 1 Pharmacological effects of M. cymbalaria ( A ) Fruit and ( B ) Tuber, Leaf and Root ( C ) Morphology of the leaf, mature fruit and seed. Materials and methods Plant material The different tissues (leaf, mature fruit and seed) were collected from three month old disease free plant of M. cymbalaria grown at Department of Bioinformatics, Science Block, Alagappa University, Tamil Nadu, India which served as the source for our study. RNA isolation and sequencing Mature and healthy three different tissues parts leaf, mature fruit and seed of M. cymbalaria were collected and RNA isolation was performed with TRIzol \u00ae Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The concentration of RNA was determined using a Qubit \u00ae 3.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific Wilmington, Delaware, USA). The quality and integrity of RNA among the tissue samples were evaluated using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). Samples with an RIN (RNA Integrity Number) value higher than 8.0 were considered for further processing for cDNA library preparation. The sequencing library was prepared based on the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines employing mRNA library kits (Qiagen). Subsequently, the libraries were then processed for 2 \u00d7 150 bp paired-end sequencing in the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina, USA) at Biokart India Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, India. De Novo assembly and validation The quality of the raw paired-end reads was evaluated using FastQC 15 . Adapter sequences were removed with Cutadapt 16 and low-quality bases were trimmed using Sickle 17 . The high-quality paired-end reads were subjected to de novo assembly using Trinity 18 with default parameters, employing its three independent modules: the Inchworm module for assembling unique transcripts using k-mer values, the Chrysalis module for clustering related contigs, and the Butterfly module for reconstructing full-length transcripts and distinct splice isoform transcripts. To reduce redundancy, the assembled transcripts were clustered using CD-HIT 19 . Assembly quality was assessed using TransRate 20 and the completeness of the transcriptome assembly was evaluated using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) 21 . Coding sequence prediction The TransDecoder ( https://transdecoder.github.io ) tool was utilized to predict coding regions from validated transcripts. The first step in TransDecoder involves identifying Open Reading Frames (ORFs) within the transcripts. The second step is to predict the coding potential of each ORF. It identifies candidate coding regions within transcript sequences, such as those generated by Trinity with a length cut-off of 50 bases were used to predict ORFs. Functional annotation and gene ontology classification To infer putative functions, the de novo assembled unigenes of M. cymbalaria were compared against the Viridiplantae (taxid: 33090) Non-Redundant (NR) protein database at NCBI using the BLASTX program, with an E-value cut-off of 1.0E-03. InterProScan was used to query against nine databases: FPrintScan, BlastProDom, HMMSmart, ScanRegExp, HMMPIR, HMMPfam, Profile Scan, HMMTigr and SuperFamily through OmicsBox ( https://www.biobam.com/omicsbox ). InterProScan predicts protein domains and important sites by classifying them into families. The GO mapping also provides ontologies of defined terms representing gene product properties, categorized into biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. Additionally, Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) and pathway information (KEGG) were also mined using the OmicsBox program (Version 3.0; https://www.biobam.com/omicsbox ). The COG classification was employed to assign unigenes into orthologous groups based on evolutionary conservation. This allowed the functional inference of genes, particularly those involved in basic cellular processes and metabolism, and was instrumental in grouping genes with no prior functional annotation critical for a non-model species like M. cymbalaria with limited genomic data. In parallel, KEGG pathway mapping enabled the identification of unigenes involved in various metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. This was especially valuable for detecting genes related to the synthesis of pharmacologically important secondary metabolites. Pairwise differential expression analysis Using OmixBox, we have conducted an analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through a pairwise comparison of two distinct experimental conditions. The NoiSeq program 22 was used, utilizing a quantitative statistical approach to evaluate the significance of individual genes between two experimental conditions (Seed vs. Leaf and Seed vs. Mature Fruit). Normalization was performed using the RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Per Million mapped reads) method. Enrichment analysis Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is used to identify gene sets that are statistically significant and consistently shows differences between two tissue types 23 . The GSEA table was generated using OmicsBox (Version 3.0). Prediction of transcription factor The identification of transcription factors (TFs) in the M. cymbalaria transcriptome was carried out using the Plant Transcription Factor Database (PlantTFDB; http://planttfdb.gao-lab.org/ ) 24 . The assembled unigene sequences were submitted to the PlantTFDB functional annotation pipeline, which employs a combination of homology-based sequence alignment, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and domain validation to predict and assign unigenes to specific TF families. Validation of differential expression genes by qRT\u2011PCR To validate the assembly, three transcripts associated with various secondary metabolism biosynthesis pathways (ALA-interacting subunit 1-like, ubiquitin-fold modifier 1, and ribonuclease 3-like) were selected. The corresponding FASTA sequences were retrieved, and primers were designed by Primer-BLAST online tool. The design criteria were as follows: amplicon size of 169\u2013227 bp, primer length of 20\u201321 bases, melting temperature between 57 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C, and a GC content of 50\u201355%. For each RNA sample, 3 \u00b5l of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Takara cDNA synthesis kit. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was then performed on a QuantStudio\u2122 5 RT-PCR system using SYBR Green chemistry at BioMe Live Analytical Center, Karaikudi, India. All reactions were performed in three technical replicates. The actin gene of M. cymbalaria was used as an endogenous control due to its stable expression across all samples. The thermal cycling program was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, 59 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min 20 s, with a final hold at 72 \u00b0C for 4 min. Results RNA sequencing Over 124 million raw reads were generated from all the tissues which approximately size to 9.5 GB of paired-end sequencing data. All the raw reads generated from three cDNA libraries were deposited at the Short Read Archive (SRA) (BioProject PRJNA873352) under the accession numbers SRX17319165 (Leaf), SRX17319163 (Mature Fruit) and SRX17319164 (Seed). De Novo transcriptome assembly and validation The pre-processing of raw reads was conducted using Cutadapt and Sickle to remove adapter sequences and low-quality reads, resulting in a total of 35,504,500 clean reads retained across all samples. Transcriptome assembly was independently performed for each tissue leaf, seed, and mature fruit using Trinity with default parameters, producing distinct sets of transcripts for each. The leaf sample yielded 161,871 assembled transcripts, seed sample produced 279,163 transcripts, and mature fruit sample generated 94,039 transcripts. Assembly quality was assessed based on GC content, N50 values, and BUSCO completeness, which indicated completeness scores of 75.06% for leaf, 70.59% for seed, and 75.76% for mature fruit. Detailed assembly statistics for each tissue were listed in Table 1 . For comprehensive analysis, a combined dataset was constructed by merging the individual assemblies from all three tissues. This combined transcriptome was used for the downstream analyses, including functional annotation, gene set enrichment, and pathway mapping.

The results indicate that 28% of the assembled transcripts comprised complete ORFs. Conversely, 28% of transcripts exhibited 5\u2032 partial ORFs with a missing start codon while 10% of transcripts displayed 3\u2032 partial ORFs with a missing stop codon. Moreover, 33% of the total transcripts were missing both start and stop codons (Fig. 2 A). Similarity search and functional annotation of unigenes The results showed 72,283 annotated unigenes and, while 3,78,502 unigenes remained non-annotated out of the 4,50,785 assembled transcripts. Due to the limited genomic information available for M. cymbalaria , annotated genes were categorized as predicted, uncharacterized, or hypothetical proteins. The species distribution analysis of the top hits matching the sequences confirmed that Momordica charantia (31.67%) had the highest number of matches with M. cymbalaria , followed by Lupinus albus (6.54%), Tanacetum cinerariifolium (5.97%), Cichorium endivia (4.47%), Rhynchospora breviuscula (3.48%), Quercus suber (3.36%), Benincasa hispida (2.45%), Pleodorina starrii (2.01%) Cucumis melo var. makuwa (1.83%) and Ricinus communis (1.83%) (Fig. 2 B).

Gene ontology (GO) classification The Gene Ontology (GO) database has emerged as a crucial web resource in the bioinformatics field. GO offers a curated collection of dynamic, controlled and structured vocabularies for describing gene functions and their products 25 . The assembled unigenes were annotated with GO classifications using the OmicsBox software ( https://www.biobam.com/omicsbox ), encompassing three main categories: Molecular Function, Cellular Component and Biological Process. A total of 2,42,672 genes were assigned to 13 sub-categories in the biological processes. This includes 40,027 genes associated with organic substance metabolic process, 37,383 genes involved in primary metabolic process, 34,500 genes in nitrogen compound metabolic process, 36,211 genes in the cellular metabolic process, and 21,131 genes in the biosynthetic process. In molecular function, 1,81,789 genes were classified into 12 sub-categories. These included 28,292 genes related to heterocyclic compound binding, 28,340 genes associated with organic cyclic compound binding, 17,945 genes exhibiting transferase activity, 15,473 genes with small-molecule binding, and 16,938 genes with hydrolase activity. Additionally, 1,26,350 genes were assigned to the cellular component category, spanning 7 sub-categories where intracellular anatomical structure had the highest number of unigenes (31,122), followed by the membrane (29,326 genes), cytoplasm (22,902 genes), and organelle (21,316 genes) (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Functional classification of M. cymbalaria contigs based on Gene Ontology (GO): ( A ) Biological Processes, ( B ) Molecular Function and ( C ) Cellular Components. Functional classifications by COG The Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) database categorizes orthologous gene products. All unigenes were analyzed using a BLAST search against the COG database to predict and classify their functions. A total of 1,54,248 sequences were assigned to COG classifications, distributed across 25 COG categories (Fig. 4 ). Among these 25 COG classes, the \u201cFunction Unknown\u201d cluster (37400, 24.24%) comprised the largest proportion of the group, followed by \u201cReplication, Recombination and Repair\u201d (12883, 8.35%), \u201cTranscription\u201d (9827, 6.37%), \u201cSignal Transduction Mechanisms\u201d (9694, 6.28%) and \u201cAmino Acid Transport and Metabolism\u201d (9666, 6.26%). The overrepresentation of orthologous genes related to replication, transcription, signal transduction, amino acid transport, and posttranslational modification (PTM) in the transcriptome of M. cymbalaria can be attributed to the essential roles they play in plant growth, development and stress responses. Our dataset showed that 3,922 unitranscripts, constituting 2.54% of the total unitranscripts annotated with the COG database, represented the \u201cSecondary Metabolites Biosynthesis, Transport and Catabolism\u201d category. This indicates the presence of a large number of secondary metabolites present in M. cymbalaria . Conversely, categories such as \u201cChromatin Structure and Dynamics\u2019\u2019 (596, 0.38%), \u201cCell Motility\u201d (409, 0.26%), \u201cExtracellular Structures\u201d (86, 0.05%) and \u201cNuclear Structure\u201d (43, 0.02%) exhibited the fewest unigenes. Fig. 4 COG classifications of putative proteins of M. cymbalaria .

The total number of features analyzed was 450,785. In the Seed vs. Leaf comparison, 122,679 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 52,934 were upregulated (M > 0) and 69,745 were downregulated (M < 0). For the Seed vs. Mature fruit comparison, 166,039 DEGs were observed, including 99,231 upregulated (M > 0) and 66,808 downregulated (M < 0) genes (Fig. 5 A). The comparison across three libraries identified 67,006 DEGs (Fig. 5 B), indicating variations in gene expression among M. cymbalaria tissues. The down-regulation of genes observed in seeds compared to leaves suggests a transition in metabolic priorities from growth and development (as seen in leaves) to nutrient storage and dormancy (as observed in seeds). Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare the distribution of differentially enriched GO-terms across the three investigated samples of M. cymbalaria . Figure 6 illustrates enriched bar charts of GO names associated with up-regulated genes. Based on these findings, contigs associated with GO names of U5 snRNP, actin filament binding, golgi membrane and nucleobase transmembrane transporter activity underwent further analysis and discussion. We then filtered and grouped contigs expressed across all three samples. A detailed description of these groups, including information on GO names, contig numbers, enzyme names and functions is provided in Supplementary Table 1 .

Mining transcription factor families Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression and are involved in various aspects of plant growth and development 40 . A total of 5,025 unitranscripts from M. cymbalaria were annotated in the Plant TF database (PlnTFDB) and classified into 56 TFs categories (Fig. 7 , Supplementary Table 2). The predominant TF families identified include bHLH (430), C2H2 (368), MYB_related (362), NAC (300), ERF (292), bZIP (281), C3H (256), WRKY (191), GRAS (180), MYB (159), G2-like (140), Trihelix (140), B3 (137), HD-ZIP (117), HB-other (114), and FAR1 (105). Fig. 7 Identification of the transcripts encoding transcription factors in M. cymbalaria . Expression and validation by qRT-PCR Experimentally evaluated the quality of de novo assembled unigenes, three transcripts related to secondary metabolism (ubiquitin-fold modifier 1, ALA-interacting subunit 1-like, and ribonuclease 3-like) were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. DNase-treated total RNA was isolated from the leaves, mature fruit, and seeds of healthy M. cymbalaria plant and used for cDNA synthesis with random hexamer primers. Initially, PCR was conducted using cDNA as the template to verify the specific amplification of each transcript. Following this, qRT-PCR analysis was performed, revealing the expression of all three selected transcripts, with actin serving as the internal control. The primer sequences for the selected unigenes are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . The ALA-interacting subunit 1-like (ALA11) gene exhibited significantly lower expression in leaves compared to seeds but showed notable upregulation in mature fruit relative to seeds. Conversely, ribonuclease 3-like (r3l) displayed higher expression levels in leaves compared to seeds, with relatively consistent expression between mature fruit and seeds. The ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (ufm1) gene demonstrated consistently low expression across all tissues (leaves, mature fruit and seeds). The upregulation of specific genes in leaves and mature fruit suggests enhanced metabolic activity in these tissues, particularly for secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. This indicates active biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which likely contribute to the plant\u2019s medicinal properties. On the other hand, the downregulation of genes in seeds highlights a shift in metabolic priorities toward dormancy and nutrient storage, reflecting a diminished role in secondary metabolism but emphasizing preparatory functions for germination (Fig. 8 ).

Discussion M. cymbalaria stands out as a significant vegetable crop, known for its nutritional richness and medicinal components. Its spectrum of properties encompasses antidiabetic, antidiarrheal, anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and nephroprotective attributes 10 \u2013 12 . However, the absence of genomic data has severely impeded molecular biology research on M. cymbalaria . With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, transcriptome sequencing analysis has become increasingly accessible and cost-effective 26 . In this study, we have conducted transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of M. cymbalaria . The combined assembly produced 450,785 transcripts with an N50 of 460 bp and a GC content of 45.8%. Among these, 72,283 high-quality unigenes were annotated using the NCBI-nr protein database through OmicsBox software. Analysis of species distribution indicated that M. cymbalaria unigenes exhibited the highest similarity to genes from the Cucurbitaceae plant family, with 31.67% showing homology to M. charantia genes. Furthermore, we identified several prevalent protein families and domains in the M. cymbalaria transcriptome, including P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (IPR027417), NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily (IPR036291), Protein kinase-like domain superfamily (IPR011009), Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily (IPR011990), ABC transporter-like ATP-binding domain (IPR003439), Protein kinase domain (IPR000719), and Serine-threonine/tyrosine-protein kinase catalytic domain (IPR001245). The P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase is involved in various essential cellular processes in plants, including energy metabolism, signal transduction, transport, stress responses, and growth regulation 27 . Another essential protein family, the NAD (P)-binding domain superfamily, plays a crucial in hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) in plants. This domain plays a significant role in the enzymatic activity of HSDs, participating in metabolic processes such as steroid, monosaccharide and flavonoid metabolism 28 . Moreover, protein kinases in plants are integral to various biological processes, including development, growth, stress responses, hormone signaling, and immune defense mechanisms. These kinases are essential components of signal transduction pathways that enable plants to effectively respond to environmental stimuli such as light, temperature, pathogens and drought 29 . The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-like ATP-binding domain is a crucial component of ABC transporters in plants, facilitating active transport across cellular membranes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. These transporters play essential roles in hormone transport, detoxification, nutrient uptake and responses to environmental stresses 30 . The Protein kinase domain is vital in plants, serving as the catalytic site for protein kinases, which regulate cellular processes such as signal transduction, growth, development and stress responses 31 . The Serine-threonine/tyrosine-protein kinase catalytic domain is crucial for governing the catalytic activity of protein kinases in plants and other organisms, regulating processes like growth, development and stress responses 32 . Overall, these protein families and domains play integral roles in various aspects of plant physiology, from fundamental cellular processes to responses to external stimuli and genetic material maintenance. BLAST hits near the significance threshold provided most of these assignments, often involved low-complexity sequences prone to producing false-positive results 33 . However, in the present study several contigs in this study showed no significant homology to known sequences in existing databases. This observation suggests the presence of previously unidentified protein-coding genes with unique functional roles, noncoding RNAs (such as regulatory miRNAs or lncRNAs), or fragmented portions of longer unannotated transcripts. Gene ontology classification was performed to annotate the transcripts into three major categories such as cellular components (1,26,350), molecular function (1,81,789) and biological process (2,42,672). A total of 1,54,248 sequences were COG classifications and were distributed between 25 COG categories. Among the 25 COG classes, the cluster of \u201cfunction unknown\u201d constituted the largest proportion of the group, suggesting the presence of genus specific or species-specific functions. Remarkably our dataset also showed that 3,922 (2.54%) of the total annotated unitranscripts with COG database represented the \u201csecondary metabolites biosynthesis and transport and catabolism\u201d category this suggesting the presence of a large number of secondary metabolites in M. cymbalaria . Plants produce various secondary metabolites that serving functions such as defence and signalling molecules, with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industry 34 . Through transcriptome analysis, researchers have elucidated biosynthetic pathways, identified key enzymes and mapped out the biosynthesis of significant compounds. Previous studies have identified several compounds isolated from different parts of this plant, including flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, triterpenes, sterols, etc. 11 , 35 , . This study primarily focuses on biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. Biological pathway analysis was conducted using the KEGG database to identify various pathways associated with the transcriptome data, resulting in the annotation of 126 pathway maps. Terpenoids are key secondary metabolites in plants and have significant economic value, attributed to their ability to resist diseases and fungi, as well as their various physiological activities such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidizing properties 36 . Numerous unigenes were found to be involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, including (i) hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH), (ii) acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase, (iii) 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, (iv) diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, (v) 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase, (vi) 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, (vii) isopentenyl phosphate kinase,, (viii) (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase, (ix) protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase, (x) isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase, xi) farnesyl diphosphate synthase, xii) prenylcysteine oxidase/farnesylcysteine lyase xiii) 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase, xiv) hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and xv) 2-C-methyl-D erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. Prenylquinones such as plastoquinone and ubiquinone serve as electron transporters in the electron transport chain of oxygenic photosynthesis and the aerobic respiratory chain, respectively. They play critical roles in plant growth and development by participating in the biosynthesis and metabolism of important chemical compounds, acting as antioxidants, contributing to plant stress response and regulating gene expression and cell signal transduction. Ubiquinone has shown favourable effects in the treatment of cancer and human reproduction disease, as well as treating cardiovascular disease, chronic gingivitis and periodontitis 37 . The unigenes involved in ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis pathway are aminodeoxyfutalosine synthase, 3-demethoxyubiquinol 3-hydroxylase, NAD (P)H dehydrogenase (Quinone), demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase, vitamin-K-epoxide reductase (Warfarin-sensitive). Plant steroids have a wide range of medical properties, including anti-tumor, immunosuppressive, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, plant growth hormone regulator, sex hormone, antihelminthic, cytotoxic and cardiotonic action 38 . The major unigenes identified in steroid biosynthesis were delta14-sterol reductase, cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase, lysosomal acid lipase and delta24 (24(1))-sterol reductase. A variety of medicinal benefits have been reported on isoquinoline alkaloids including antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, enzyme inhibitor and antispasmodic properties 39 . Our findings revealed that unigenes involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis were aspartate aminotransferase, primary-amine oxidase, mitochondrial and tyrosine aminotransferase. The present study identifies key enzymes involved in various biosynthetic pathways, including hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase in terpenoid biosynthesis, cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase in steroid biosynthesis, and aminotransferases in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, all of which are crucial for the therapeutic potential of M. cymbalaria . Transcription factors have significant roles in plant development and in regulating responses to various environmental stresses 40 . In this study, a total of 5,025 M. cymbalaria unitranscripts were annotated at the PlnTFDB. The major transcription factor families identified were bHLH, C2H2, MYB_related, NAC, ERF, bZIP, C3H, WRKY, GRAS, MYB, HB-other and FAR1. Notable unigenes linked to secondary metabolism included bHLH, bZIP, WRKY, MYB, ARF, and ZF-HD. Conclusion We present the first investigation into de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation of M. cymbalaria . Our transcriptome analysis of M. cymbalaria across various tissues (leaf, mature fruit, and seed) using the Illumina platform has revealed a large number of transcripts implicated in diverse processes, functions, and metabolic pathways. Our analysis unveiled transcripts associated with several secondary metabolic pathways, including isoquinoline alkaloid, terpenoids, steroids, and ubiquinone. These metabolites are known for their diverse pharmacological activities, including antidiabetic, anticancer, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. The study identified key enzymes involved in these pathways, such as hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (in terpenoid biosynthesis), cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase (in steroid biosynthesis), and aminotransferases (in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis), highlight the potential of M. cymbalaria in addressing diabetes mellitus, ulcers, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Notably, transcription factor families such as bHLH, bZIP, WRKY, MYB, ARF, and ZF-HD were associated with secondary metabolism, highlighting their regulatory roles in these critical pathways. To further validate our findings, we conducted qRT-PCR to assess and confirm the tissue-specific expression levels of these candidate genes.

    "full_text_abstract": "Momordica cymbalaria (Athalakkai), a medicinally important Cucurbitaceae species, is widely used in traditional medicine due to its antidiabetic, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic potential remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of M. cymbalaria using Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing of leaf, fruit, and seed tissues. De novo assembly generated 450,785 contigs (N50: 460 bp) with 72,283 annotated unigenes. Our key findings reveal pivotal genes involved in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically relevant secondary metabolites, including terpenoids, steroids, and isoquinoline alkaloids. Notably, enzymes such as hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase, and tyrosine aminotransferase were recognized as central to these pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis has classified the transcripts into molecular functions (181,789), biological processes (242,672), and cellular components (126,350). We further characterized 5,025 transcription factors, with bHLH, MYB, and WRKY families being prominently associated with secondary metabolism regulation. Tissue-specific expression patterns were identified and validated by qRT-PCR, showing eminent metabolic activity in leaves and fruits compared to seeds. This study provides the first genomic resource for M. cymbalaria , offering molecular insights into its medicinal properties and facilitating future biotechnological applications in drug discovery."
