  "title": "Defects in chromosome congression and mitotic progression in KIF18A-deficient cells are partly mediated through impaired functions of CENP-E.",

  "abstract_text": "KIF18A, a molecular motor, is an essential component in the regulation of orderly chromosome congression by attenuation of the kinetochore oscillation amplitude at the midzone during mitosis in vertebrate cells. Here we report that KIF18A depletion resulted in mitotic arrest which was accompanied by the presence of unaligned chromosomes in HeLa cells. This resembles the phenotype induced by an impaired function of CENP-E, also a mitotic kinesin essential for the formation of the mitotic spindles. Our further analysis showed that KIF18A depletion caused specific downregulation of CENP-E. Downregulation of CENP-E as the result of KIF18A silencing was not due to reduced transcription but primarily due to the enhanced protein degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that KIF18A physically interacted with CENP-E and BubR1 during mitosis. Ectopic expression of the wild-type tail domain of CENP-E, but not a corresponding mutant, significantly suppressed chromosome congression defects in mitotic cells. Together, our studies strongly suggest that chromosome congression defects as the result of KIF18A depletion is at least in part mediated through destabilizing kinetochore CENP-E.",
