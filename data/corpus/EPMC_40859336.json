This trend is mainly due to higher energy intake and lower physical activity. These changes are closely linked to socioeconomic development. The World Obesity Atlas 2024, released by the World Obesity Federation, reports that by 2035, around 54% of adults worldwide will have obesity. The total number is expected to reach 1.53 billion. This presents a major challenge to public health and healthcare systems [ 1 ]. In the United States, about 172 million adults aged 25 years or older were overweight or obese in 2021. This number is expected to increase to 213 million by 2050. Among them, 146 million individuals are projected to have obesity [ 2 ]. Obesity is recognized as a complex and chronic metabolic disease, primarily characterized by abnormal fat accumulation and adipose tissue dysfunction. It is a major risk factor for numerous adverse health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [ 3 ]. A J-shaped relationship has been observed between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality. Higher BMI is linked to shorter life expectancy [ 4 ]. Although progress has been made in understanding and treating obesity, it remains difficult to assess individual risk and predict outcomes. More research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms that drive obesity. It is also important to identify reliable biomarkers. These efforts will support more accurate diagnosis, guide personalized treatment, and improve clinical care [ 5 ]. To meet these challenges, the researchers are increasingly turning to molecular profiling technologies that can offer deeper insights into disease biology. Recent progress in molecular profiling technologies has offered new tools to study the biological basis of human diseases, including obesity. Among various omics approaches, proteomics has emerged as particularly valuable. It allows researchers to identify disease-related proteins and measure changes in protein levels during disease development. This helps in early detection, treatment monitoring, and target discovery for precision medicine [ 6 ]. Unlike genomics and transcriptomics, proteomics can detect post-translational modifications and protein\u2013protein interactions [ 7 ]. These features have made proteomics central to biomarker discovery and precision medicine in obesity-related research. Although studies on proteomics in obesity have grown rapidly in recent decades, there remains a lack of systematic summaries that reflect how the field has developed and shifted over time. Bibliometric analysis provides a practical means to explore research patterns, examine academic influence, and track the evolution of key themes. In this study, we applied bibliometric analysis to explore the global development of proteomics research in the context of obesity. Rather than merely reporting publication counts or collaboration patterns, we sought to uncover emerging research themes and highlight areas that remain underexplored. Drawing on data from the past 26 years, our analysis covers national and institutional contributions, funding sources, influential researchers, core journals, citation networks, and the evolution of key terms. By providing a comprehensive overview of these dimensions, we aim to offer a valuable resource for scholars in the field and to inform future research strategies. Methods Search approach In our study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis using the Science Citation Index-Expanded database of WoSCC. Literature retrieval was conducted using the following search logic: TS = (metaproteome OR metaproteomics OR proteome OR proteomics OR metaproteogenomic) AND TS = (obese OR obesity OR obesities OR overweight OR \u201cover weight\u201d OR adiposity). The search was limited to publications from January 1, 1999, to February 12, 2025. The results were exported in both plain text and tab-delimited formats, including full records and reference details. Only English-language original research articles and reviews were included. Initially, 1801 publications were identified; however, 103 were excluded for not meeting the criteria of original articles or reviews, and 10 were removed due to language restrictions (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Flowchart of step-by-step literature screening process. A total of 1801 records were identified from the Web of Science Core Collection. After removing non-original articles/reviews and non-English publications, 1688 records were included for bibliometric analysis Data analysis Prior to analysis, we manually standardized author names, affiliations, and keywords to correct for spelling and formatting inconsistencies. The duplicate entries were removed or merged as needed to improve the accuracy of authorship and collaboration data. Two researchers independently downloaded and processed the records using the same retrieval strategy and export settings. Each conducted visualization and mapping analyses with VOSviewer and CiteSpace separately. Their outputs were then compared to check for consistency in clustering and network patterns. Any differences were discussed and resolved before proceeding with the final analysis. The bibliometric information required from the literature, including author names, journal titles, affiliations, countries/regions, publication years, citation counts, reference records, and keywords, was retrieved in plain text and tab-separated formats (\"Full Records and Cited References\"). These data were then analyzed using VOSviewer (version 1.6.20) and CiteSpace (version 6.3.R1) for country and institutional analysis, journal and co-citation analysis, author and co-cited author analysis, and keyword co-occurrence analysis [ 8 ]. By integrating these knowledge mapping and visualization analyses, current research hotspots and trends can be identified. Results Worldwide trend in publication numbers and citations As shown in Fig. 2 , the annual publication output on proteomics in obesity research from 1999 to 2025 exhibited an overall upward trend with slight fluctuations. The highest number of studies was observed in 2022 ( n = 184), while the lowest was in 1999 ( n = 2). Between 2004 and 2014, the annual publication output ranged from 14 to 71 articles on average. However, a noticeable surge in the number of publications occurred in the last decade, particularly from 2018 ( n = 97) to 2022 ( n = 184). As of the search date, the total citations for all articles amounted to 49,801. From 2010 to 2022, the annual citation count consistently exceeded 3000, highlighting sustained academic attention in this area (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 The number of annual publications and citation trend Distribution and global contribution of countries/regions, institutions Building upon the rising publication trend, we next examined the geographical distribution of research output. Table 1 summarizes the top ten most productive countries/regions in proteomics-related obesity research. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the United States led with 534 publications, followed by China ( n = 322) and Germany ( n = 187). The U.S. also had the highest H-index ( h = 72), indicating both volume and impact, with Germany ranking second ( h = 42). These findings underscore the dominant role of the U.S. in shaping the field. The international collaboration network, constructed using VOSviewer and an online bibliometric platform, included 24 countries with at least 25 publications (Fig. 3 b, c). Line thickness reflects the Total Link Strength (TLS), representing collaboration intensity. The U.S. demonstrated extensive partnerships, particularly with China, which emerged as its closest collaborator. In contrast, inter-country collaborations beyond these key players appeared limited, suggesting opportunities for broader global cooperation.

The top ten co-cited authors were cited more than 70 times, with Cox J. ranking first ( n = 167), followed by Hotamisligil G. S. ( n = 124) and Huang D. W. ( n = 99). Based on a threshold of \u2265 30 co-citations, 103 authors were included in the co-citation network analysis, providing insight into influential research collaborations and intellectual structure within the field (Fig. 5 a, b). Fig. 5 The network ( a ) and density ( b ) visualization of co-cited authors Analysis of journals To understand the publication outlets shaping the field, we identified the top 15 journals publishing articles on proteomics in obesity research. Proteomics and International Journal of Molecular Sciences were the most productive, with 50 and 48 publications, respectively. Among these journals, Nature Communications had the highest impact factor, while Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications had the lowest. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics received the most citations ( n = 2060), highlighting its influence in the field. Of the 15 journals, 37% were classified as JCR Q1, and 63% had an impact factor above 4.0, suggesting strong journal quality overall (Table 4 ).

In parallel, citation burst analysis (Fig. 7 ) identified 25 references with rapid citation increases over time. The top-ranked burst was Perez-Riverol et al. (2023\u20132025; strength = 11.69), followed by another work by the same author and by Szklarczyk et al. (strength = 10.32). These bursts indicate periods of heightened attention to key methodological resources and databases. Overall, burst strengths ranged from 4.21 to 11.69, with durations from 1 to 5 years.

Fig. 8 Citespace visualization map of timeline view Analysis of keyword co-occurrence To complement citation-based insights, we sorted the recurring keywords and identified the top 20 words with the highest frequency (Table 6 ). This was conducted by combining similar keywords with the most representative topics in proteomics for obesity researches as comprehensively as possible. Given that \u201cproteomics\u201d and \u201cobesity\u201d were part of the search strategy, their high frequency is unsurprising and not inherently meaningful.

As visualized in Fig. 9 a, nine major clusters emerged. Cluster 1 (red) centers on multi-omics approaches and the gut microbiota, with terms like metagenomics, microbiome, and metaproteomics, reflecting growing interest in microbial contributions to metabolic disorders. Keywords such as bariatric surgery and weight loss highlight clinical management, while pregnancy and saliva suggest a shift toward specific populations and non-invasive sampling. Cluster 2 (green) focuses on metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, highlighting the frequent use of integrative omics and causal inference methods, including Mendelian randomization. Given the complexity of the full network, we highlight Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 as representative examples of distinct but prominent thematic directions. These clusters capture both mechanistic and translational aspects of obesity research. Additional clusters also contribute to the field\u2019s diversity, though not discussed in detail. Fig. 9 The network ( a ), overlay ( b ) of keyword co\u2011occurrence on proteomics for obesity researches To further explore how these research foci have changed over time, a temporal overlay analysis was conducted. As shown in Fig. 9 b, it illustrates a shift from basic research on adipokines and insulin to more systemic and translational topics, including lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, type 2 diabetes, and PCOS. This trend underscores a broadening of research focus toward clinical application and precision medicine. Discussion Obesity is a complex metabolic condition involving diverse biological pathways and significant inter-individual variation. Traditional metrics such as body mass index (BMI) are limited in capturing differences in fat distribution and metabolic health status [ 9 ]. Identifying biomarkers that can predict these complications at an early stage is, therefore, essential for effective clinical intervention [ 7 ]. In this context, proteomics has emerged as a valuable approach for identifying protein biomarkers associated with obesity-related complications, offering insights into disease mechanisms and opportunities for improved diagnosis and treatment planning. Global knowledge structure Our bibliometric analysis reveals a steady growth in proteomics research related to obesity over the past two decades. The number of studies rose sharply after 2010, peaking in 2022. This trend may reflect both advances in analytical technologies and heightened attention to translational applications of proteomics. The slight decline observed afterward may be attributed to indexing delays in bibliographic databases and an ongoing shift in research focus toward integrative and translational directions, which are not always consistently categorized under traditional proteomics labels. The sustained citation growth since 2010 suggests that the field has gained stable academic recognition. The field is shaped by strong international participation, led by the United States, China, and Germany. Active bilateral collaboration, particularly between the U.S. and China, plays a major role in driving scientific output. Prominent institutions such as the University of Copenhagen, Maastricht University, and Harvard Medical School have served as research hubs, often coordinating multicenter efforts. These collaborative structures reflect the global scope of proteomics research in obesity and underscore the value of sustained institutional networks. Several scholars have made substantial contributions to the field. Notably, Yun Jong Won and Choi Jung Won have maintained high publication activity, while co-citation analysis highlights influential figures such as Cox J and Hotamisligil GS. Their foundational work on proteomic tools and metabolic mechanisms has shaped both methodological standards and scientific direction. Global research priorities and trends Our keyword and reference analyses demonstrate a clear thematic shift over time. Early studies focused on insulin signaling, adipokines, and animal models, reflecting efforts to define basic molecular processes. More recent attention has turned to clinically relevant areas such as lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, type 2 diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The increasing use of multi-omics and causal inference methods, including The Mendelian randomization, reflects a growing emphasis on translational applications. This analysis draws on the average year in which each keyword appeared, as shown in the overlay map. Although this measure does not reflect the most recent research activity, it is commonly used in bibliometric studies to indicate when certain topics began to attract broader and sustained attention. The observed time pattern reflects a gradual shift in research focus, moving from cellular and molecular mechanisms to more integrated investigations of systemic metabolism and related diseases. The overlay visualization helps demonstrate how the field has expanded toward more complex and clinically relevant directions. Among the emerging themes, lipid metabolism has gained prominence due to its central role in fat accumulation and metabolic regulation [ 10 ]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), for instance, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target due to its regulatory effects on lipid processing and fat distribution [ 11 ]. Likewise, the gut microbiota has been linked to chronic inflammation in obesity, shifting attention toward host-microbe interactions [ 12 \u2013 14 ]. Type 2 diabetes and PCOS remain critical complications, driving interest in early biomarkers and personalized management strategies [ 15 , 16 ]. Weight loss and antidiabetic therapies have shown effectiveness in improving metabolic outcomes and supporting diabetes remission [ 17 , 18 ]. Evidence from both observational study and randomized controlled trials indicates that bariatric surgery leads to significant improvements in metabolic and reproductive outcomes among women with obesity and PCOS [ 19 , 20 ]. These biological themes reflect both the complexity of obesity and the areas where proteomics research has become increasingly active. The proteomic analyses have helped identify key protein markers associated with inflammation, glucose control, and lipid dysregulation [ 21 \u2013 23 ]. While these findings highlight the clinical relevance of proteomics, our study emphasizes how this field has evolved in terms of research output and thematic direction, rather than focusing on specific molecular pathways. In summary, this bibliometric study outlines the growth trajectory and evolving priorities of proteomics research in obesity. By mapping publication trends, author influence, institutional collaboration, and research hotspots, our analysis provides a foundation for understanding how the field has developed and where future opportunities may lie. These findings may support strategic planning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the identification of underexplored topics for further investigation. Limitations This study was based on data from the WoSCC, a widely used and trusted source for bibliometric research. Although other databases like Scopus and PubMed may include additional publications, WoSCC is well-recognized for its indexing quality and compatibility with bibliometric tools. We believe the data used here offer a solid reflection of global research trends in proteomics and obesity.

    "full_text_abstract": "Aims Proteomics plays an essential role in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of obesity. This study aimed to map global research trends, identify major contributors, and examine evolving themes in this field over the past two decades. Methods A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) from 1999 to February 2025. Only English-language original articles and reviews were included. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to analyze publication volume, collaboration networks, core journals, citation patterns, and keyword co-occurrence. Results A total of 1688 publications were analyzed. Research output increased steadily and peaked in 2022. The United States led in publication count and citations, followed by China and Germany. Keyword analysis revealed a clear thematic shift: early studies focused on adipose biology and hormonal regulation, while more recent work highlights topics such as gut microbiota, lipid metabolism, type 2 diabetes, and PCOS. These shifts reflect an increased focus on systemic mechanisms and a stronger link to clinical needs such as diagnosis and personalized treatment. Conclusion Proteomics research in obesity has grown in both scale and complexity, with expanding global collaboration and evolving scientific priorities. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the field\u2019s development and offers direction for future translational and interdisciplinary efforts.\n\nKey Points Research on proteomics in obesity has grown rapidly in the past 20 years, with a noticeable surge after 2010. The U.S., China, and Germany have made major contributions, and recent studies increasingly focus on gut microbiota, lipid metabolism, and related disorders. This bibliometric analysis offers a clear picture of global progress and points to key areas for future research and collaboration."
