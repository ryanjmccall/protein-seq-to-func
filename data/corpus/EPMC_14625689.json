  "abstract_text": "Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have emerged as a new class of signaling molecules that play important roles in the development and function of the central nervous system. They include both tyrosine-specific and dual-specific phosphatases. Based on their cellular localization they are also classified as receptor-like or intracellular PTP. However, the intracellular mechanisms by which these PTPs regulate cellular signaling pathways are not well understood. Evidence gathered to date provides some insight into the physiological function of these PTPs in the nervous system. In this review, we outline what is currently known about the functional role of PTPs expressed in the brain.",
