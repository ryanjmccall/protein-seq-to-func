  "abstract_text": "Forty-four Finnish volunteers who were previously studied with regard to the repair rate of UV-specific cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the skin were genotyped for XPD polymorphisms at codons 312 (exon 10 G-->A, Asp-->Asn) and 751 (exon 23 A-->C, Lys-->Gln). The repair rate was measured at 24 h for two different cyclobutane dimers. The data did not show consistent XPD genotype-specific differences in DNA repair rates among all subjects. The combined exon 10 AA and exon 23 CC genotype was associated with an approximately 50% depression of repair rate but this was of borderline statistical significance. However, the exon 23 C allele was associated with depressed repair among subjects aged 50 years or older and the result was consistent with both dimers.",
