  "abstract_text": "Prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) qualify as lymphoid growth and differentiation factors. Yet, long-standing hyper- or hyposecretion of PRL or GH does not induce any significant alteration of the immune system. Subclinical changes in laboratory parameters (such as chemotaxis or phagocytosis by granulocytes or macrophages or natural killer cell activity) have been reported in some of these conditions. The GH-insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I axis is dysregulated in ageing, in catabolic states and in critical illness. Immune parameters, such as infection rate, are being monitored during clinical trials with GH or IGF-I. Hyperprolactinaemia may play an aggravating role in systemic lupus erythematosus, in autoimmune thyroiditis and in other autoimmune diseases. The patient may benefit from increased alertness about interactions between the endocrine and immune systems.",
