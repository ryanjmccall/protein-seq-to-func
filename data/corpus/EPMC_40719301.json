It is characterized by systemic immune-mediated vasculitis targeting small- to medium-sized vessels, often involving multiple organs, and has the highest prevalence in Asian populations. KD is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children, with coronary artery involvement persisting in 4%\u20136% of cases even after standard treatment. A variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia, and fungi, have been associated with KD ( 1 ). Viral infections, in particular, may play a significant role in its pathogenesis. According to current literature, at least 15 viruses have been linked to KD ( 2 ). However, no direct evidence exists to confirm their causative role. Viruses are believed to contribute to the formation of superantigens, which can hyperactivate the immune system ( 3 \u2013 6 ), leading to the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other enzymes that accelerate extracellular matrix degradation and endothelial cell destruction, resulting in coronary artery lesions ( 7 ). Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) may activate the host immune system ( 8 \u2013 11 ). Various HERVs have been detected in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where proteins derived from HERV genes mimic self-antigens, triggering autoimmune responses and inflammatory reactions in SLE. HERVs, remnants of ancient retroviral infections integrated into the human genome, account for approximately 8% of the human genome. These retroviruses can be activated by genetic, environmental, and other factors, potentially contributing to the development of diseases such as SLE, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, vesicourethral epithelial carcinoma, clear-cell renal carcinoma, and breast cancer ( 12 ). Studies have shown that HERV-K mRNA expression is abnormally elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of elderly men and smokers, correlating with increased plasma interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) levels. This association suggests that HERVs could serve as biomarkers for diagnosing prostate cancer ( 13 ) and potentially as therapeutic targets for TP53-mutant B-cell lymphomas ( 14 ), highlighting their clinical relevance. HERV-W, a member of the ancient class I HERV family, is implicated in various diseases. For instance, HERV-W is highly expressed in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis, where its expression correlates with disease progression, clinical stage, and treatment outcomes, potentially triggered by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or its indirect activation ( 15 ). Direct evidence also links retroviruses to schizophrenia, with differential expression of HERV-W observed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue. Its environmental genes contribute to pathogenesis through several mechanisms, such as regulating brain-derived neurotrophic factors, activating C-reactive proteins, and modulating the expression of genes like 5-hydroxytryptophan receptor 4. The associated circ_0001810 has been proposed as a potential biomarker ( 16 \u2013 20 ). Furthermore, HERV-W may play a role in the pathogenesis and development of type 1 diabetes through both pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects ( 21 ). The envelope gene of HERV-W, syncytin-1, is abnormally overexpressed in various cancers, including endometrial cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma (UCC), and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is involved in tumor immune escape ( 22 , 23 ). In healthy individuals, HERV transcription is generally suppressed by DNA methylation. However, factors such as viral infections, drugs, and gene mutations can modulate HERV expression. Viral infections known to regulate HERVs include cytomegalovirus, which trans-activates the HERV-K and HERV-W pol genes ( 24 ), and Dengue virus serotype 2, which upregulates numerous HERV loci ( 25 ). Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhances HERV-K expression ( 26 ), while EBV latent cycle genes activate the HERV-K18 superantigen ( 27 ). Additionally, the hepatitis B x protein regulates HERV-W env expression via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway ( 28 ). HERV-W env is also highly expressed in the blood cells of patients with COVID-19 ( 29 ). Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, through primary infection or latent proteins, can activate both HERV-K and the oncogene NP9 ( 15 ). Regarding drugs, caffeine and aspirin can promote the expression of HERV-W env and gag in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells ( 30 ). Gene mutations, such as those in the 3\u2032-LTR of HERV-W env in bladder cancer, are associated with UCC, enhancing promoter activity and contributing to tumorigenesis and progression ( 31 ). Despite the established involvement of HERVs in various diseases, their potential role in KD remains unclear. To investigate this, this study employed a bioinformatics approach to analyze public databases from NCBI, comparing the expression of known HERV genes/elements in the transcriptomes of children with KD and healthy controls. This analysis aimed to identify novel HERVs, followed by transcriptional validation of these genes in blood samples from patients with KD. Phylogenetic analysis of the novel HERVs was performed to explore the potential correlation between HERVs and KD. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrieving and analyzing public databases for HERV transcripts in children with Kawasaki disease and controls Selecting and downloading a suitable transcriptome database The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides the largest and most comprehensive public data platform, encompassing various sub-databases and offering nucleic acid and protein sequence data globally. Among its many resources, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database stands out for its rigorous quality control, making it a valuable tool for researchers. The GEO database offers open access to diverse and abundant data, including high-quality data sets. In this study, the GEO database was used to search for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data related to KD using the search query \u201ckawasaki disease AND blood AND human.\u201d The earliest NGS data available in the GEO database dates back to December 2007. Thus, data collection period was set from December 2007 to September 2024. Data were specifically selected from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) in the GEO database, which contained transcriptome sequencing data relevant to KD. Selection criteria included data sets involving both KD-affected children and healthy controls, with sequencing methods encompassing second-generation sequencing of total mRNA from peripheral blood, and data available in the raw fastq.gz format. Upstream analysis of HERV transcriptome data Before analyzing the differential expression of HERVs between children with KD and healthy controls, upstream analysis of the HERV transcriptome data was conducted. On a Linux system, sequencing read quality was first evaluated using FastQC. The downloaded raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format were then quality trimmed by removing adapter sequences using Trim Galore, with the options set to \"-phred 33-length 35 -stringency 3\". FastQC was used again to assess the quality of the trimmed reads, after which three low-quality samples were removed. For efficient analysis, STAR software was used for one-stop processing, including comparison, conversion, and alignment. The trimmed reads were mapped to the human genome (HG38 assembly), and the mapped reads in SAM format were converted to BAM format and sorted by coordinates. Finally, HERV quantification was performed using featureCounts, with the UCSC gene annotations source and RepeatMasker data in HISAT2. The resulting raw read count matrix was then utilized as input for all subsequent analyses in this study. Differential HERV expression analysis Differential expression analysis of the gene expression matrices was conducted using the DESeq2 package in R. HERVs were ranked by P -value and log 2 FoldChange, with |log 2 FoldChange| > 0.58 and Padj <0.05 considered differentially expressed. This criterion was consistently applied across both data sets, and the final upregulated and downregulated gene sets from the two databases were intersected. Differential gene expression was visualized through heatmaps, volcano plots, and Venn diagrams, created using the Pheatmap and Venn packages. Screening the database for novel HERVs for Kawasaki disease To identify novel HERVs in the genomes of children with KD, the downloaded data sets were first de-joined and spliced. The resulting spliced sequences were then compared using Diamond BLASTx, annotated in Megan, and extracted from retroviral sequences. These sequences were imported into Geneious Prime to predict open reading frames (ORFs) using default parameters (minimum size: 100 bp). The predicted ORFs were subsequently compared to related coding genes using the BLASTx algorithm. HERV genes with amino acid sequence similarity of less than 90% were designated as novel HERVs. To eliminate the possibility of incorporating false sequences, these novel HERVs were re-mapped to the original transcriptome database in Geneious Prime, and coverage was calculated to confirm the true expression of these sequences. Validation of HERV in children with Kawasaki disease Blood sample collection from children with Kawasaki disease and healthy children Peripheral blood samples and clinical data were collected from children diagnosed with KD at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University between November 2023 and February 2024. Both complete and incomplete KD cases were included in the study. The diagnostic criteria for complete KD were as follows ( 32 ): fever lasting for 5 days or more, accompanied by at least 4 of the following 5 major clinical features: (1) non-exudative conjunctival congestion in both eyes; (2) dry, red, cracked lips, a \u201cstrawberry\u201d tongue, and diffuse erythema of the oropharynx; (3) acute non-suppurative cervical lymphadenopathy (usually >1.5 cm in diameter); (4) polymorphous skin rash, including isolated peri-cardinal erythema; and (5) erythema of palms and soles, hard edema of hands and feet during the acute phase, and membranous desquamation around fingernails or toenails during the recovery phase, with or without coronary artery involvement. The diagnostic criteria for incomplete KD included fever lasting 5 days or more (or of variable duration), and the presence of 2 or 3 of the 5 major clinical features, along with definitive echocardiographic changes in the coronary arteries. Exclusion criteria were as follows ( 32 ): (1) presence of developmental malformations or inherited metabolic diseases; (2) family history of other malignant diseases. Healthy children of similar age and sex, who underwent physical examinations at the hospital during the same period, were used as controls. A 2 mL peripheral blood sample was collected from patients with KD in a fasting state and from healthy controls within 24 h after hospital admission. The samples were anticoagulated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), transferred to 2 mL RNase-free EP tubes and immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The study was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University (Ethics No. KY2023K0805), and all participants provided written informed consent. Real-time quantitative PCR to verify the difference in HERV expression at nucleic acid levels between children with Kawasaki disease and healthy children Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol method, followed by removal of gDNA with the HiScriptIII 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (+gDNA wiper) and reverse transcription into cDNA. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Novel HERV assays were performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system with AceQ SYBR-Green qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the internal reference gene to normalize expression levels. Primers were designed using Geneious Prime and Primer Premier 6, adhering to strict primer design principles. After experimental screening for single-peak melting curve primers, the sequences of primers for all targets were selected as shown in Table S1 . The \u0394Ct method was employed for relative quantification, and data were analyzed based on comparisons of \u0394Ct values. After data collection, control samples were included automatically, and the average CT value for the entire run was calculated. Each sample\u2019s CT value was then compared to the average CT value of the control to determine the relative expression level of each target gene. Statistical analysis Data were collated and analyzed using SPSS 27.0.1, with statistical analysis and plotting conducted using GraphPad Prism 10. Data that followed a normal distribution were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, while categorical data were expressed as counts and percentages (%). The F -test assessed data normality, and unpaired t -tests were used to compare independent groups. Statistical significance was defined as a P -value < 0.05. Phylogenetic analysis of novel HERVs To explore the evolutionary relationship between the novel HERVs identified in this study and known HERVs, protein sequences encoded by closely related genes were compared using BLASTp in NCBI. High-similarity reference sequences were downloaded, and low-quality comparison regions were removed using MEGA11. Novel HERVs with nucleic acid sequences shorter than 200 bp were identified using BLASTn, and their positions on the chromosome were determined. Larger ORFs were located in Geneious Prime, and ORFs of greater length were selected for protein sequence comparison. The list of all protein sequences used for phylogenetic analysis was selected as shown in Table S2 , with accession numbers and source databases. Phylogenetic trees of these protein sequences were constructed by incorporating similar sequences downloaded from public databases using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method in MEGA11. The phylogenetic trees were visualized and annotated using the iTOL website. RESULTS Basic information on data Between December 2007 and September 2024, 470 results related to human KD were identified in the GEO database, with data distributed across nine countries or regions worldwide. A total of 37 public data sets were uploaded, primarily featuring blood samples, along with some data from human set cell lymphoma (REC) and human peripheral blood set cell lymphoma cells (Mino). Earlier sequencing results were mainly derived from gene chip and microarray technologies, while high-throughput sequencing data sets predominantly emerged over the past decade. The objectives of these sequencing studies included aiding in the genetic diagnosis of KD, facilitating the differential diagnosis of bacterial, viral, and other pathogens, studying gene expression patterns in children with KD during the acute and recovery phases, and identifying differences in gene expression between responders and non-responders to IVIG treatment. Although most data sets used blood samples, there were notable variations in sample processing, including some that extracted PBMCs and others that used purified white blood cells. Sequencing methods also varied, encompassing single-cell sequencing, DNA sequencing, and RNA sequencing. For this study, 62 publicly available KD child transcriptome raw sequencing data sets were downloaded from the SRA database. mRNA expression of known HERVs in blood samples from children with Kawasaki disease in the SRA database Following upstream analysis of the HERV transcriptome data, low-quality samples were excluded. Genes that showed expression across all samples (geometric mean reads per million [RPM] > 1) were retained for downstream analysis. Two KD transcriptome sequencing libraries from the SRA database were selected: one from London, UK ( PRJNA271099 , GSE64486 ) ( 33 ) and the other from La Jolla, CA, USA ( PRJNA739210 , GSE178491 ) ( 34 ). Differential expression analysis revealed a total of 825 and 5751 HERV regulatory abnormalities, comparing acute-phase whole blood RNA from patients with KD to control samples from healthy donors. The criteria for differential expression were |Log 2 FC| > 0.58 and FDR < 0.05. In the PRJNA271099 data set, 825 regulatory abnormalities were identified, including 524 upregulated HERVs and 301 downregulated HERVs. In the PRJNA739210 data set, 5751 regulatory abnormalities were detected, consisting of 5,390 upregulated HERVs and 361 downregulated HERVs. In both data sets, the number of upregulated HERVs exceeded the downregulated ones. A total of 172 HERVs were highly expressed in both data sets, identified by intersecting the upregulated HERVs from each library ( Fig. 1 ). Fig 1 Differentially expressed HERVs in Kawasaki disease.

SRA database mRNA expression of novel HERV in blood samples from children with Kawasaki disease Using the criterion of less than 90% amino acid sequence similarity to known viruses for determining novel HERVs, 35 novel HERVs were identified in the PRJNA271099 data set. These novel HERVs ranged in length from 100 nucleotides or more, contained complete ORFs, and exhibited sequence identity with known viral sequences ranging from 37.00% to 89.47%, suggesting the potential identification of new HERV species ( Table 1 ). Some of these sequences were shorter than the reference genome of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), indicating that they might represent fragments of the viral genome. Additionally, viral sequences with greater than 90% identity were predicted and compared to known HERV elements. To exclude the possibility of incorporating false sequences, the identified sequences were re-mapped to the original transcriptome database using Geneious Prime to assess the coverage. RPKM normalization was applied to calculate the read lengths, multiplying the number of original read lengths of R1 in the upper bipartite and the length of the ORF sequences to determine the true expression. The data were further scaled up and treated with log2 normalization for subsequent analysis. The expression levels of the ORFs in the original library ranged from 0.66 to 7.73, with varying degrees of read matching. However, these sequences could not be assembled into overlapping clusters of sufficient length, possibly due to differences in library construction methods or insufficient sequencing depth ( Fig. 2 ).

General characteristics of children with Kawasaki disease and healthy control children In this study, 18 children with KD were included: 6 males and 12 females, with ages ranging from 1 year and 6 months to 10 years, and a median age of 4 years. The control group consisted of 10 healthy children: 3 males and 7 females, with ages ranging from 2 years to 9 years, and a median age of 6 years. There were no statistically significant differences in age and sex between the KD group and the control group ( P > 0.05) ( Table 2 ).

HERV-K-3157 (designated as KD1.9_contig_3157) showed a peak expression of 5.71 in children in the acute phase of KD, higher than the peak of 3.31 in controls and 2.38 in the recovery phase, suggesting an upregulation trend. Additionally, the gene later confirmed as HERV-K18 ( KD1.11_contig_4566 ORF2 ) was expressed at 4.99 in the KD group, while in the control group, it was 3.89, highlighting a more pronounced difference. The highest expression in the KD group was 5.94, compared to 3.10 in the control group, reinforcing the upregulation trend. These three HERV genes were selected for primer design, with single-peak melting curves confirming specific amplification. Expression levels were validated by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR, and \u0394CT values (\u0394CT = CT HERV - CT GAPDH ) were compared between the two groups. The results revealed significantly higher expression of HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K18 pol in the peripheral blood of children with KD compared to healthy controls ( P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in the expression levels of the novel HERV-K-3157 was observed ( Table 3 and Fig. 3 ).

Phylogenetic analysis of novel HERVs To confirm that the newly identified HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K-3157 sequences belong to the HERV family, NJ phylogenetic analyses were conducted on the longer ORFs in which they are located. The analysis included reference sequences from the HERV-K family, assembled from publicly available data from NCBI, as well as major representative ERVs such as gorilla ERV-K7 , silver and white gibbon ERV-K7 , and gopher ERV-K . Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the two newly identified genes in the KD transcriptome database ( PRJNA271099 ) are part of the HERV family, clustering with known reference sequences of HERV-K elements with strong bootstrap value support. Both HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K-3157 sequences were distinctly separated from those of other ERVs and clustered in the outermost group of HERV-K family, representing two novel species within the HERV-K family ( Fig. 4 ).

DISCUSSION The instability of RNA viruses, along with host diversity and environmental changes, has driven viral mutation and evolution. Retroviruses, which are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses infecting vertebrates, integrate into the host genome when infecting germ cells. This integration is inherited vertically from parent to offspring, forming ERVs. Throughout human evolution, exogenous retroviruses have infected human germ cells and integrated into the human genome, giving rise to HERVs, which make up approximately 8% of the human genome. These retroviruses have coexisted with humans for millennia and are closely linked to human development and disease. Although they have only recently been redefined, some HERVs have lost their transcriptional capability due to base insertions or deletions; however, a subset remains regulated by long terminal repeats (LTRs) ( 33 ), which can activate a substantial number of transcripts through methylation in immunocompromised or tumorous conditions. These HERVs are implicated in immune disorders, neurological conditions, and neoplasms in humans. Among immune-related diseases, several have been shown to be influenced by HERV transcription, including systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease, food allergies, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, herpes simplex, and rheumatoid arthritis ( 35 ). HERVs play pivotal roles in cell physiology, immune modulation, and neurodevelopment. For instance, HERV-W encodes the Syncytin-1 protein, which is crucial for placental trophoblast formation and cell fusion ( 36 \u2013 38 ). In hepatocellular carcinoma, Syncytin-1 drives cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion via the MEK/ERK pathway. In leukemia, overexpression of Syncytin-1 inhibits apoptosis and enhances resistance to chemotherapy. HERVs also exhibit dual immunomodulatory functions: activated HERV-K envelope proteins trigger type I interferon responses and the release of pro-inflammatory factors, contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases ( 39 ). Conversely, HERV activation in tumors may promote immune escape by inducing antiviral signaling pathways and depleting the IFN pathway ( 40 ). Epigenetically regulated HERVs are involved in neuronal RNA transport, and their dysfunction has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, indicating their potential role in disease pathogenesis ( 41 ). Over recent decades, advancements in sequencing technology have made it increasingly feasible to generate large-scale genomic data, expanding the understanding of known viruses. However, the number of undiscovered viruses remains far greater than what is currently known. Research on HERVs primarily focuses on known sequences, with limited knowledge about their potential impact on other diseases. Public databases, with sufficient sequencing depth, are now more capable of supporting studies on cells or DNA. The scarcity of research on KD due to limited sample availability has long hindered progress in understanding the connection between viruses and this condition. However, the growing availability of public databases has overcome this challenge, facilitating the identification of novel viruses potentially linked to KD from a broader range of samples. This study represents the first bioinformatics-based attempt to analyze potential HERV gene transcripts in KD using the public SRA database from NCBI, aiming to identify HERV genes associated with KD onset. A total of 62 pairs of NGS data from children with KD and healthy controls were analyzed, revealing 825 and 5751 differential HERV gene transcripts, with the criteria of |Log 2 FC| > 0.58 and FDR < 0.05 ( 42 ). Ferlita et al. identified 130 and 82 dysregulated HERVs in aggressive and inert phenotypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), some of which were specific and validated by RT-PCR. The most upregulated HERV in CLL was highly expressed in samples, and the protein it encodes was positively correlated with Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) expression in both aggressive and inert CLL phenotypes. Inhibition of HERV expression by treatment with the BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib) led to over 50% survival in the CLL model, suggesting that aberrantly regulated HERVs may be involved in CLL pathogenesis ( 42 ). These findings suggest the existence of disease-specific highly expressed HERVs. This preliminary discovery also indicates the abundant diversity of HERVs in the human genome. Additionally, novel HERVs were mined from the KD database by de-joining and splicing the original sequences, extracting retroviruses, annotating, and comparing them. HERV genes encoding amino acid sequences with less than 90% similarity to known sequences were classified as novel. In the PRJNA271099 database, 35 novel HERVs were identified. Two of these, showing upregulated gene expression in the KD group compared to controls, were selected for further investigation. One of these genes, identified as HERV-K18, with an expression level of 4.99, was chosen for the next stage of experimentation. To validate the expression of HERVs in the peripheral blood of children with KD, blood samples were collected from both patients with KD and healthy controls. Real-time quantitative PCR was employed to assess the differences in the expression of the three HERV genes previously mentioned. The results revealed that HERV-K18 transcript levels were significantly higher in the peripheral blood of children with KD ( P < 0.05). HERV-K18 encodes a superantigen known to stimulate CD4 +T cells ( 43 ), which is associated with the persistence of type 1 diabetes and EBV infection. It is unevenly distributed across different organs, indicating spatio-temporal specificity. In vitro experiments have shown that the HERV-K18 superantigen can negatively select human thymocytes, suggesting its role in controlling peripheral tolerance ( 44 ). Furthermore, the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein-2A is activated by the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif ( 27 ). Given that EBV infection is commonly associated with the onset of KD in children ( 45 \u2013 47 ), it is essential to explore whether EBV-induced immunosuppression in patients with KD could trigger a substantial activation of HERV-K18 transcriptional superantigen. The potential role of the HERV-K18 superantigen in modulating inflammatory responses and causing peripheral immune tolerance dysregulation warrants further investigation. Additionally, this study found that HERV-K-2177 transcript levels were significantly elevated in the peripheral blood of children with KD compared to healthy controls ( P < 0.05). In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the transcript levels of HERV-K-3157 ( P > 0.05). To understand the classification and phylogenetic relationships of novel HERVs, phylogenetic analysis of the two novel HERVs was conducted. The sequences of HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K-3157 were clearly separated from other ERVs, clustering within the HERV-K family and positioned at the outermost group. This indicates that both HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K-3157 represent novel species within the HERV-K family. The HERV-K family has been closely linked to cancer, with its trans-activated transcription of proteins such as env, gag, rec, and NP9 being associated with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. These HERV-K proteins contribute to cancer development through mechanisms such as the misregulation of oncogenes, proto-oncogenes, or growth factors by the LTRs of the HERV-K locus ( 48 ). The HERV-K family is vast. Accumulating evidence suggests its potential involvement in autoimmune diseases. Oliver Hohn et al. demonstrated that HERV-K gag expression is significantly elevated in the peripheral blood of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), contributing to autoimmune responses through molecular mimicry. In adolescents with RA, increased levels of HERV-K superantigens further support a potential link between HERV-K and RA in this population. However, not all members of the HERV-K family are associated with autoimmune diseases; for example, HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 showed no significant increase in the peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis compared to healthy controls ( 49 ). In the current study, the expression of HERV-K-2177 was notably higher in the peripheral blood of children with KD, whereas no significant difference was observed for HERV-K-3157, suggesting that different HERV-K members may play distinct roles. Although the precise mechanism behind the elevated expression of HERV-K-2177 in KD pathogenesis was not investigated, studies on other known HERVs have shown that HERV-W can contribute to the development of schizophrenia by inducing cellular pyroptosis, activating innate immune responses, and triggering ferroptosis ( 50 \u2013 52 ). Furthermore, activated HERV-W has been implicated in neurological damage during the pathological progression of multiple sclerosis ( 53 ). Additionally, Syncytin-1 plays a significant role in the development of endometrial cancer, leukemia, and other tumors through its involvement in immune evasion mechanisms ( 22 , 37 ). These findings underscore the pivotal role of HERV-related genes and proteins in the pathogenesis of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and various cancers, emphasizing the strong association between HERVs and these conditions. The mechanisms by which HERVs influence KD remain unclear and warrant further investigation. The present study may further validate the proteins encoded and expressed by the HERV-K family in human coronary artery endothelial cell lines ( 54 ), assess cell viability using CCK-8, and measure the expression of KD-associated inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-8, and NF-\u03baB) via ELISA to explore the relationship between HERVs and the inflammatory response in KD. While protein-level validation was not conducted, the study successfully identified a connection between KD and HERVs. Nevertheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. The sample size was constrained due to challenges in obtaining rare samples, resulting in the identification of fewer HERVs. Additionally, the study was restricted by time and funding limitations. Despite these constraints, rigorous internal validation methods were employed to ensure the reliability of the data, and the results were consistently replicated across RT-qPCR experiments from different batches, minimizing potential technical artifacts. Although broader generalizations will require larger sample sizes in future studies, this research provides a foundational understanding and sets the stage for subsequent investigations. Future studies will incorporate an increased sample size to validate additional transcriptional features of the HERV gene, thereby further elucidating its role in KD.

    "full_text_abstract": "ABSTRACT Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), integral to the human genome, are implicated in autoimmune diseases through superantigen-mediated vascular inflammation. This study examined NCBI next-generation sequencing blood transcriptome data from 62 pairs of children with acute Kawasaki disease (KD) and healthy controls. Bioinformatics analysis identified differentially expressed HERV gene sequences (|Log 2 FC| > 0.58, FDR < 0.05), revealing 825 and 5,751 distinct HERV transcriptional variations across two KD data sets ( PRJNA271099 and PRJNA739210 ). Novel HERVs were defined by amino acid sequence similarity of <90%. HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K-3157 demonstrated 70.27% and 56.06% protein-level similarity to known HERVs, respectively. Validation with real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR on blood samples from 18 patients with KD and 10 healthy controls showed significantly elevated expression of HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K18 mRNA in patients with KD ( P < 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis placed HERV-K-2177 and HERV-K-3157 within the HERV-K family, though at the peripheral cluster, indicating their potential as novel HERV species. These results suggest a possible association between HERV-K-2177 transcriptional expression and KD. IMPORTANCE Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are intricate retroviruses passed down through the human genome. This study identified two novel HERVs in the blood transcriptome of children with Kawasaki disease and conducted preliminary experiments to explore the correlation between HERVs and the disease. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these viruses may represent potential new HERV species. These findings suggest a potential association between HERV transcript expression and Kawasaki disease."
