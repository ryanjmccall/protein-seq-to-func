    "abstract_text": "<h4>Purpose</h4>C-myc was studied in cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 associated granulosa cell apoptosis,<h4>Methods</h4>Granulosa cells (N = 5 cases) were incubated for 24 h in either 1 or 50 microM COX-2 inhibitor, 1 or 50 microM COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, negative or positive controls Single primer polymerase chain reaction of c-myc exon 1 were performed. Bisbenzimide-stained control single-stranded (ssDNA) were hybridized to SYBR Gold-stained ssDNA and fluorescent images analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>C-myc was disrupted by the high-dose COX-2 inhibitor. Cell viability decreased with COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition. However, cell viability was similar for the positive control and at low-dose COX-2 inhibition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 initiated apoptosis without disrupting c-myc suggesting a protective effect on c-myc. The low dosage of the COX-2 inhibitor did not disrupt c-myc and cell viability. C-myc sensitization was not part of apoptosis.",
