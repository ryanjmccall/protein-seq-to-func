  "abstract_text": "Genomic DNA probes generated from the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene located on chromosome 17 and from the MYL gene located on chromosome 15 were used to study the chromosome 15 breakpoints resulting from the t(15; 17) translocation in 26 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In 20 out of 22 patients with a detectable MYL rearrangement, the breakpoints were clustered within a 4.4 kb segment designated MYLbcr. The two remaining patients exhibited a more 5' rearrangement at about 10 kb upstream of the MYLbcr region, implying the lack of at least one MYL gene exon in the resulting MYL-RARA fusion gene. The variation of chromosome breakpoints within the MYL gene may explain size heterogeneity previously observed in some MYL-RARA fusion transcripts expressed in APL cells.",
