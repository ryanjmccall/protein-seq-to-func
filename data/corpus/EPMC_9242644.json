    "abstract_text": "We have cloned a novel winged helix factor, WIN, from the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that WIN is highly expressed in a variety of insulinoma cell lines and rat embryonic pancreas and liver. In adults, WIN expression was detected in thymus, testis, lung, and several intestinal regions. We determined the DNA sequences bound in vitro by baculovirus-expressed WIN protein in a polymerase chain reaction-based selection procedure. WIN was found to bind with high affinity to the selected sequence 5'-AGATTGAGTA-3', which is similar to the recently identified HNF-6 binding sequence 5'-DHWATTGAYTWWD-3' (where W = A or T, Y = T or C, H is not G, and D is not C). We have isolated human WIN cDNAs by library screening and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Sequence analysis indicates that the carboxyl terminus of human WIN has been previously isolated as a putative phosphorylation substrate, MPM2-reactive phosphoprotein 2 (MPP2); WIN may be regulated by phosphorylation. Alignment of the rat and human WIN cDNAs and their comparison with mouse genomic sequence revealed that the WIN DNA binding domain is encoded by four exons, two of which (exons 4 and 6) are alternatively spliced to generate at least three classes of mRNA transcripts. These transcripts were shown by RNase protection assay to be differentially expressed in different tissues. Alternative splicing within the winged helix DNA binding domain might result in modulation of DNA binding specificity.",
