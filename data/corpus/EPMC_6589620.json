  "abstract_text": "Human urokinase cDNA clones have been identified from a cDNA library prepared from total RNA of human fibroblasts transformed by simian virus 40 [Okayama, H. & Berg, P. (1983) Mol. Cell. Biol. 3, 280-289]. Synthetic oligonucleotides, corresponding to urokinase protein sequence, were used as probes. The cloned cDNA covers most of the coding sequence and the entire 3' untranslated region. The nucleotide sequence of one of the clones identifies this as a copy of a partially spliced polyadenylylated precursor to urokinase mRNA. The introns separate functionally different domains of the enzyme. Human urokinase mRNA has been identified by RNA blot and its size was estimated at 2500 nucleotides.",
