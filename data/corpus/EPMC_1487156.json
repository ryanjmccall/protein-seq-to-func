  "abstract_text": "Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor that binds to and transactivates promoters of growth hormone- and prolactin-encoding genes. A chromosomal gene related to human Pit-1 isolated from human gene libraries was over 14 kb long and split into six exons. All of the splice donor and acceptor sites conformed to the GT/AG rule. The gene was mapped to human chromosome region 3p11.",
