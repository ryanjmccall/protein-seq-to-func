  "abstract_text": "The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and in protection from apoptosis. IGF-1R has been shown to be an appealing target for the treatment of human cancer. Herein, we report the synthesis, structure-activity relationships (SAR), X-ray cocrystal structure and in vivo tumor study results for a series of 2,4-bis-arylamino-1,3-pyrimidines.",
