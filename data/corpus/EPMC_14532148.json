    "abstract_text": "Ideally, the inflammatory response occurs rapidly to terminate infection. It also must halt in a timely manner to stop this reaction from inflicting self damage. Such a highly regulated process results from altering balances in pro- and anti-inflammatory signals orchestrated by multiple cell types and factors within the tissue microenvironment. The discovery of new substrates of metalloproteinases within this microenvironment has disclosed a new function in inflammation. The role of these proteases now extends beyond extracellular matrix remodelling enzymes to that of mediators of inflammatory signals involving various chemokines and cytokines. As natural inhibitors of these metalloproteinases, TIMPs have the potential of regulating the inflammatory response and affecting diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. TIMP-3, in particular, stands out as an important regulator of inflammation with its ability to specifically inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and tissue destruction in the joint.",
