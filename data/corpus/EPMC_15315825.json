    "abstract_text": "The MDM2 proto-oncogene, which encodes a protein that binds to the p53 tumour suppressor, has been found amplified and overexpressed in a range of human tumours. Although the human MDM2 cDNA sequence has been reported, the genomic organisation of the human gene has not been documented. We have previously reported the detection of five alternative internally deleted MDM2 transcripts in human tumours and suggested these may represent alternatively spliced forms. Here we demonstrate two novel MDM2 transcripts with internal deletions, using RT-PCR followed by sequencing. To definitively ascribe these variant transcript forms to alternative splicing, and to explore associated mechanisms, we have determined the intron--exon organisation of the human genomic sequence. The human MDM2 gene spans approximately 33 kb and is divided into 12 exons. Exon sizes range from 50 to > or =1161 bp and intron sizes vary from 121 to approximately 7000 bp. The positions of intron--exon boundaries are compared with the deletion junctions of the multiple-sized transcripts and discussed in relation to alternative splicing mechanism.",
