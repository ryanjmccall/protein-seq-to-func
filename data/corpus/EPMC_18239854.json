    "abstract_text": "Gamma-Secretase is a promiscuous protease that cleaves bitopic membrane proteins within the lipid bilayer. Elucidating both the mechanistic basis of gamma-secretase proteolysis and the precise factors regulating substrate identification is important because modulation of this biochemical degradative process can have important consequences in a physiological and pathophysiological context. Here, we briefly review such information for all major classes of intramembranously cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs), with an emphasis on gamma-secretase, an I-CLiP closely linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. A large body of emerging data allows us to survey the substrates of gamma-secretase to ascertain the conformational features that predispose a peptide to cleavage by this enigmatic protease. Because substrate specificity in vivo is closely linked to the relative subcellular compartmentalization of gamma-secretase and its substrates, we also survey the voluminous body of literature concerning the traffic of gamma-secretase and its most prominent substrate, the amyloid precursor protein.",
