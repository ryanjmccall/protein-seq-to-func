  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "The human glutathione S-transferase pi gene has been isolated from a cosmid library. The gene spans approximately 3 kb, is interrupted by six introns and the region around its 5' end has the high G + C and CpG content typical of an HTF (HpaII tiny fragment) island. In addition to a TATA box at position -28 relative to the transcription initiation site and two G + C boxes (GGGCGG), the promoter contains a sequence motif matching the phorbol ester- and ras-responsive element from the polyoma virus enhancer.",
