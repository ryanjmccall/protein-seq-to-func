  "title": "Human TP53 from the malignant glioma-derived cell lines M059J and M059K has a cancer-associated mutation in exon 8.",
  "year": 2000,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/11023613",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "The protein coding segment of the TP53 genes from the glioma-derived cell lines M059J and M059K was sequenced. The sequences from both cell lines were identical over 5039 bp, including the gene segment containing exons 2 through 9, exon 10, and the proximal segment of exon 11. In both cells, the first nucleotide of codon 286 (GAA, Glu) is changed to an A (AAA, Lys). Comparison with the same TP53 segment from the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line revealed several differences in intron sequence.",
