    "abstract_text": "Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a cytokine that possesses interesting, potential therapeutic properties. However, based on several parameters including activation of neutrophils, it is also recognized as a proinflammatory cytokine. The mechanisms by which IL-15 activates human neutrophil functions are not fully understood. Although these cells express a functional IL-15 receptor (IL-15R) composed of IL-15Ralpha, IL-2/15Rbeta (CD122), and gamma(c) (CD132) subunits, the role of each receptor component has not been investigated in IL-15-induced human neutrophil responses. In the present study, fluorescein-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that the ability of IL-15 to enhance neutrophil phagocytosis is not a result of increased expression of IL-15Ralpha, CD122, or CD132 on the neutrophil cell surface. Pretreatment of neutrophils with specific antibodies to IL-15Ralpha, CD122, or CD132 was found to inhibit phagocytosis of opsonized-sheep red blood cells by nearly 40%, 21%, and 27%, respectively. As expected, pretreatment of neutrophils with anti-IL-2Ralpha (CD25) had no effect. Pretreatment of cells with the Syk inhibitor piceatannol was found to significantly inhibit the ability of IL-15 to enhance phagocytosis. In addition, IL-15 was found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk that was largely inhibited by pretreating cells with piceatannol. Moreover, we found that Syk kinase is physically associated with IL-15Ralpha. We conclude that IL-15R enhances neutrophil phagocytosis by a Syk-dependent mechanism and that the IL-15Ralpha chain plays a key role in mediating this response, at least by interacting with Syk kinase.",
