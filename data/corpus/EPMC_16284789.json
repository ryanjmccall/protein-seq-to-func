  "abstract_text": "We identified a novel mutation (S142F) in the human mtDNA CO I gene in a patient with a clinical phenotype resembling mitochondrial cardioencephalomyopathy. To substantiate pathogenicity, we modeled the identified mutation in the homologous gene in Paracoccus denitrificans and analyzed the biochemical consequences. We observed a deleterious effect on enzyme activity, with a lack of heme a3. Taking advantage of the extensive structural homology between the bacterial enzyme and the mammalian core complex, we conclude that the novel S142F mutation is disease-related. This approach can be used in other cases to support the pathogenicity of novel variants in the mitochondrial genome.",
