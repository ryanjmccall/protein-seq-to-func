    "abstract_text": "Neurotrophins are a kind of factor regulating the growth and survival of selected peripheral and central nervous system. Brain -derived neurotophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the family. A BDNF cDNA clone by screening human placenta cDNA library with a probe prepared by PCR with the template of human fetus brain cDNA was obtained. The cloned human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (HUMBDNFD) was sequenced. It contained 1 335 base pairs. After being analyzed with GenBank (1993.10.NIH.USA), the HUMBDNFD contained complete coding and 3^ untranslated region with homology (100%) to the described three BDNF cDNA sequences (HUMBDNF, HUMBDNFB,HUMBDNFC), but the 5^ untranslated region differed from them.",
