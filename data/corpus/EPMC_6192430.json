    "abstract_text": "Molecular cloning has established the primary structures of two precursors of the human pancreas growth hormone-releasing factor (hpGRF-44), somatocrinin. Both polypeptides contain the sequence of hpGRF-44 flanked by basic processing sites. Furthermore, the precursors include a putative signal sequence and a carboxyl-terminal amidation signal for hpGRF-44. The two forms of mRNA code for pre-pro-GRF-107 and pre-pro-GRF-108. Pre-pro-GRF-108 differs from pre-pro-GRF-107 by the insertion of a serine in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the precursor. In vitro translation of tumor poly(A)+ RNA followed by immunoprecipitation with GRF-specific antiserum and gel electrophoresis showed the molecular weight of preprosomatocrinin to be approximately 13,000, which is in good agreement with the molecular weight deduced from the sequences of the cDNA clones.",
