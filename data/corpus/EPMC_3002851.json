  "abstract_text": "Recently, we have reported the isolation of cDNAs encoding the precursors of insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and II) [(1983) Nature 306, 609-611; (1985) FEBS Lett. 179, 243-246. These cDNAs were employed as specific probes to detect and isolate the corresponding genes from human cosmid DNA libraries. Three cosmids were detected, together containing the entire cDNA sequence of IGF-I, and one cosmid containing the sequence of IGF-II cDNA. Southern blot hybridization, physical mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis of these cosmids revealed that the IGF-I and -II genes have a discontinous structure. The IGF-I gene contains at least four exons spanning a region of probably more that 45 kilobasepairs (kb), while the IGF-II gene consists of at least five exons, spanning a region of 16 kb.",
