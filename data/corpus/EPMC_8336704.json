  "abstract_text": "The retinoblastoma gene product, p110RB1, appears to regulate cell growth by modulating the activities of nuclear transcription factors. The elements that specify the transport of p110RB1 into the nucleus have not yet been explored. We now report the identification of a basic region, KRSAEGGNPPKPLKKLR, in the C terminus of p110RB1, which has sequence similarity to known bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLSs). A two-amino-acid mutation introduced into this putative NLS [to give mutant NLS(NQ)] or deletion of the entire NLS (delta NLS) abrogated exclusive nuclear localization, yielding proteins which were distributed either equally throughout the cell or predominantly in the cytoplasm. A mutant protein [NLS(NQ)/delta 22] containing both the mutated NLS and a deletion of exon 22, previously shown to disrupt the interaction of p110RB1 with several cellular transcription factors and oncoproteins, accumulated only in the cytoplasm. When fused to the C terminus of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, the RB1 NLS directed this protein to the nucleus, indicating that the motif is not only necessary but also sufficient for nuclear transport. Neither NLS(NQ) nor delta NLS was hyperphosphorylated in vivo, but both retained their abilities to interact, in vitro, with simian virus 40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1a, and the cellular transcription factor E2F. When transfected at multiple copy number, the NLS mutant alleles displayed reduced biological activity, measured by inhibition of growth of the osteogenic sarcoma cell line Saos-2, which has no wild-type RB1. Naturally occurring mutations and deletions in exon 25 of RB1 which disrupt the NLS may lead to partial or complete inactivation of p110RB1 and may be responsible for some retinoblastoma and other tumors.",
