  "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) can modulate the mitogenic and metabolic effects of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). IGFBP-3 protein levels are developmentally regulated and influenced by a number of hormonal stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. As a first step toward understanding how hormonal and developmental factors regulate IGFBP-3 production, we are characterizing the human IGFBP-3 chromosomal gene and promoter. Southern analysis demonstrates a single copy of the IGFBP-3 gene in the human genome. This gene spans 8.9 kilobases; the protein-coding region is divided into four exons while a fifth exon contains the 3'-untranslated region. Primer extension studies locate the IGFBP-3 mRNA cap site 132 base pairs 5' to the ATG translation initiation codon. On the chromosomal gene, this cap site is located 30 base pairs 3' to the start of a TATA box and 97 base pairs 3' to a consensus GC upstream promoter element, an organization common to many eukaryotic promoters. When this potential IGFBP-3 promoter region is placed upstream to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, it directs high-level production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in transfected COS-1 cells. These observations suggest an uncomplicated organization for the IGFBP-3 chromosomal gene and promoter in the human genome.",
