  "abstract_text": "To evaluate ras-mediated signal transduction, an alkaline phosphatase gene (SEAP) was placed under the control of the ras-inducible phorbol ester response element (TRE) in murine fibroblasts (TRE-SEAP cells). The Kirsten ras gene was placed under the control of the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter and introduced into the TRE-SEAP cells. Dexamethasone increased ras expression in the TRE-SEAP cells carrying the Kirsten ras gene and stimulated SEAP activity 25-fold. Lavostatin blocked dexamethasone induction of SEAP activity (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.5 microM) but did not affect phorbol ester-induced SEAP activity in the same cells. Lovastatin also did not block forskolin induction of SEAP activity in cells expressing SEAP under the control of the cyclic AMP response element.",
