  "abstract_text": "The mechanisms leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated c-Abl kinase have not yet been identified. We found that the multi-adaptor protein ArgBP2 links c-Abl to the ubiquitin ligase Cbl. Phosphorylation of Cbl and ArgBP2 by c-Abl resulted in the stabilization of their interactions, thus facilitating Cbl-induced ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of c-Abl and ArgBP2.",
