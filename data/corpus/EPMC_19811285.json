  "abstract_text": "High mobility group B box (HMGB) proteins are a family of chromatin proteins made up of two basic DNA binding domains, HMG box A and B, and a C-terminal acidic tail. HMGB have a highly conserved sequence, but different expression pattern: HMGB1 is almost ubiquitous, whereas the others are highly expressed in only a few tissues in adults. We previously demonstrated that HMGB1 is released by necrotic cells and has chemoattractant activity for inflammatory and stem cells, via binding to receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). HMGB1 can be actively secreted by inflammatory cells. Here, we report that also HMGB2 can be secreted by THP-1 cells, and promotes proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. These functions of HMGB2 are exerted via engagement of RAGE, whose blockade completely abrogates cell responses. Since extracellular HMGB2 has been detected in the blood and other biological fluids, it might be necessary to target HMGB2 at the same time as HMGB1 for therapeutical efficacy.",
