  "abstract_text": "Because of the probable causal relationship between constitutive p210(bcr/abl) protein tyrosine kinase activity and manifestations of chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; myeloid expansion), a key goal is to identify relevant p210 substrates in primary chronic-phase CML hematopoietic progenitor cells. We describe here the purification and mass spectrometric identification of a 155-kD tyrosine phosphorylated protein associated with src homologous and collagen gene (SHC) from p210(bcr/abl)-expressing hematopoietic cells as SHIP2, a recently reported, unique SH2-domain-containing protein closely related to phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase SHIP. In addition to an N-terminal SH2 domain and a central catalytic region, SHIP2 (like SHIP1) possesses both potential PTB(NPXY) and SH3 domain (PXXP) binding motifs. Thus, two unique 5-ptases with striking structural homology are coexpressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Stimulation of human hematopoietic growth factor responsive cell lines with stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) demonstrate the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 and its resulting association with SHC. This finding suggests that SHIP2, like that reported for SHIP1 previously, is linked to downstream signaling events after activation of hematopoietic growth factor receptors. However, using antibodies specific to these two proteins, we demonstrate that, whereas SHIP1 and SHIP2 selectively hydrolyze PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vitro, only SHIP1 hydrolyzes soluble Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Such an enzymatic difference raises the possibility that SHIP1 and SHIP2 may serve different functions. Preliminary binding studies using lysates from p210(bcr/abl)-expressing cells indicate that both Ptyr SHIP2 and Ptyr SHIP1 bind to the PTB domain of SHC but not to its SH2 domain. Interestingly, SHIP2 was found to selectively bind to the SH3 domain of ABL, whereas SHIP1 selectively binds to the SH3 domain of Src. Furthermore, in contrast to SHIP1, SHIP2 did not bind to either the N-terminal or C-terminal SH3 domains of GRB2. These observations suggest (1) that SHIP1 and SHIP2 may have a different hierarchy of binding SH3 containing proteins and therefore may modulate different signaling pathways and/or localize to different cellular compartments and (2) that they may be substrates for tyrosine phosphorylation by different tyrosine kinases. Because recent evidence has clearly implicated both PI(3,4, 5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 in growth factor-mediated signaling, our finding that both SHIP1 and SHIP2 are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in CML primary hematopoietic progenitor cells may thus have important implications in p210(bcr/abl)-mediated myeloid expansion.",
