    "abstract_text": "Recent evidence supports the presence of an L-glutamyl\u00a0methyltransferase(s) in eukaryotic cells, but this enzyme class has been defined only in certain\u00a0prokaryotic species. Here, we characterize the human C6orf211 gene product as \"acidic residue methyltransferase-1\" (Armt1), an enzyme that specifically targets proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in breast cancer cells, predominately methylating glutamate side chains. Armt1 homologs share structural similarities with the SAM-dependent methyltransferases, and negative regulation of activity by automethylation indicates a means for cellular control. Notably, shRNA-based knockdown of Armt1 expression in two breast cancer cell lines altered survival in response to genotoxic stress. Increased sensitivity to UV, adriamycin, and MMS was observed in SK-Br-3 cells, while in contrast, increased resistance to these agents was observed in MCF7 cells. Together, these results lay the foundation for defining the mechanism by which this post-translational modification operates in the DNA damage response (DDR).",
