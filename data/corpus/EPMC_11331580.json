  "abstract_text": "A functional genomic approach, based on systematic data gathering, was used to characterize a family of proteins containing a tripartite motif (TRIM). A total of 37 TRIM genes/proteins were studied, 21 of which were novel. The results demonstrate that TRIM proteins share a common function: by means of homo-multimerization they identify specific cell compartments.",
