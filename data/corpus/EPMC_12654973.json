    "abstract_text": "The authors searched for mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein in a Spanish family with a hereditary syndrome of hemorrhagic stroke, dementia, leukoencephalopathy, and occipital calcifications. DNA from two affected members demonstrated the Iowa amyloid precursor protein mutation previously identified as a cause of severe amyloid angiopathy without hemorrhagic stroke. These data point to other genetic or environmental factors that may determine the occurrence of symptomatic hemorrhage in amyloid angiopathy.",
