    "abstract_text": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) system has been implicated in the etiology of numerous cancers, including that of ovarian cancer. Elevated levels of EGFR are associated with poor patient prognosis. Moreover, a significant number of ovarian cancers express both the receptor and one of its ligands, suggesting an autocrine mechanism for autonomous tumor growth. Because of the implicated role of the EGFR system in neoplasia, a greater understanding of the factors involved in this system is necessary. We have recently characterized a truncated EGFR-like protein (TEGFR) in human placenta, and we now extend this investigation to ovarian cancer. We report that TEGFR is expressed in ovarian cancer and its level correlates to that of EGFR. Moreover, the level of TEGFR is reduced in metastatic compared to primary tumors. These results suggest that TEGFR may play a role in the EGFR system.",
