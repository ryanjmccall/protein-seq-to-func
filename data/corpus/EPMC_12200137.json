    "abstract_text": "Interleukin-2 induces heterodimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta and gamma subunits. This study addresses a role of the Shb adapter protein in IL-2 receptor signaling in T and NK cells. The IL-2Rbeta and gamma chains were found to co-immunoprecipitate with Shb, when each alone was co-expressed with Shb in COS cells. Using fusion proteins, the Shb SH2 domain was found to associate in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner with the IL-2 receptor beta and gamma subunits upon IL-2 stimulation in primary T cells and the NK cell line NK-92. The main binding site of the Shb SH2 domain was phosphorylated Tyr-510 in the IL-2Rbeta chain. Shb was also phosphorylated upon IL-2 stimulation when overexpressed together with IL-2Rbeta (in pre-B cells, which express the gamma chain constitutively). These cells were also less apoptotic in the presence of IL-2 than cells overexpressing a mutant Shb (with a defect SH2 domain) or cells expressing a mutant IL-2Rbeta, with the Shb binding sites mutated to phenylalanine (Y392F, Y510F). JAK1 and JAK3 were also found to associate with Shb, but in contrast to the Shb-IL-2 receptor association, JAK1 and 3 appear to associate with the proline-rich regions of Shb. In conclusion, Shb links the IL-2 receptor to other signaling proteins and mediates the regulation of apoptosis in the presence of IL-2.",
