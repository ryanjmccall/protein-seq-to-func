    "abstract_text": "Human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was studied by two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Resonance assignments were obtained for all the backbone protons and almost all of the sidechain protons of the total 70 amino acid residues, using sequence-specific assignment procedures. The secondary structure elements of human IGF-I were identified by investigation of the sequential and medium range NOEs as a preliminary step in determining the three-dimensional structure of this protein by means of distance geometry calculations. The typical NOEs of d alpha beta(i,i + 3) and d alpha N(i,i + 3), as well as the successive strong NOEs of dNN connectivities and slowly exchanging amide protons confirmed the presence of three helical segments corresponding to the sequence regions, Ala8-Cys18, Gly42-Cys48, and Leu54-Cys61, and the existence of a beta-turn in the Gly19-Gly22 region. Our results definitely indicate that the secondary structure of human IGF-I in solution is consistent with that of insulin in the crystalline state.",
