  "title": "Human dynamin-like protein interacts with the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta.",

  "abstract_text": "Members of the dynamin superfamily are implicated in vesicle trafficking. Using human glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk-3 beta) as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a novel human dynamin-like protein IV (HdynIV). When the full-length cDNA of HdynIV was sequenced, it showed that HdynIV's carboxyl terminal lacks a proline-rich domain that can bind to Gsk-3 beta. By Northern blot analysis and isoform-specific PCR, we found that HdynIV is expressed ubiquitously in all human tissues examined. Two transcripts of 2.4 and 4.4 kb are shown to be more abundant in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the 2.4-kb transcript is expressed more distinctly in the fetal liver than in the adult liver, suggesting that this protein might play a role during development. In the present report, we have demonstrated that HdynIV interacts with the Gsk-3 beta through its carboxyl-terminal region, implying than HdynIV may also be involved in cell signaling.",
