    "abstract_text": "Hepatic glucose production (HGP) maintains blood glucose levels during fasting but can also exacerbate diabetic hyperglycemia. HGP is dynamically controlled by a signaling/transcriptional network that regulates the expression/activity of gluconeogenic enzymes. A key mediator of gluconeogenic gene transcription is PGC-1\u03b1. PGC-1\u03b1's activation of gluconeogenic gene expression is dependent upon its acetylation state, which is controlled by the acetyltransferase GCN5 and the deacetylase Sirt1. Nevertheless, whether other chromatin modifiers-particularly other sirtuins-can modulate PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation is currently unknown. Herein, we report that Sirt6 strongly controls PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation. Surprisingly, Sirt6 induces PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation and suppresses HGP. Sirt6 depletion decreases PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation and promotes HGP. These acetylation effects are GCN5 dependent: Sirt6 interacts with and\u00a0modifies GCN5, enhancing GCN5's activity. Lepr(db/db) mice, an obese/diabetic animal model, exhibit reduced Sirt6 levels; ectopic re-expression suppresses gluconeogenic genes and normalizes glycemia. Activation of hepatic Sirt6 may therefore be therapeutically useful for treating insulin-resistant diabetes.",
