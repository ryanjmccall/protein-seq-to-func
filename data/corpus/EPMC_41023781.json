Thrombocytopenia is a significant multifactorial complication in IEI patients leading to severe clinical consequences including coagulative disorders and vasculopathies.<h4>Methods</h4>In the present study, we assessed frequency of thrombocytopenia in the most common IEI including combined immunodeficiency (CID), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD), agammaglobulinemia (AGA), hyper immunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and congenital neutropenia (CN). Also, we compared demographic, clinical and laboratory data between IEI patients with and without thrombocytopenia.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 890 patients (37% female) were included in this study. The frequency of thrombocytopenia in total IEI was 26.6%. Patients with CID and SIgAD had the highest and lowest frequency of thrombocytopenia (50.9% and 8.7%), respectively. Although rare, thrombocytopenia was more severe (< 50000/ul) among patients with AGA compared to other IEI entities. Notably hepatosplenomegaly and autoimmunity were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia and higher mortality in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The significant association between thrombocytopenia with lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity emphasizes the importance of paying attention to these clinical features for suspecting IEI disorders. Understanding the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in various genetic defects associated with IEI is required for the development of proper diagnostic and therapeutic techniques as well as improved quality of life of these patients.",

Keywords Inborn errors of immunity Primary immunodeficiency Thrombocytopenia Lymphoproliferation Autoimmunity issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Inborn errors of immunity (IEI), also known as primary immunodeficiencies, refer to a heterogeneous group of congenital disorders characterized by impaired innate or adaptive immune system components. IEIs present a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations including recurrent infections, lymphoproliferation, malignancies and autoimmunity [ 1 ]. Hematological complications such as thrombocytopenia are also observed in some IEI patients [ 2 ]. Thrombocytopenia is one of the most important and common complications among IEI patients, contributing to a dysregulated immune system, as well as coagulopathy and vascular disorders [ 2 – 8 ]. Thrombocytopenia is defined as platelet count less than 150,000/microliter and is generally divided into two categories, including congenital and acquired thrombocytopenia. Underlying pathogeneses are multifactorial and include decreased platelet production, increased platelet destruction, and platelet sequestration [ 9 ]. Inherited defects in thrombopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis have been reported in several IEI-related genetic defects including actinopathies (WAS, WIPF1, ARPC1B, ACTB, MKL1, DIAPH1 deficiencies), bone marrow failure (Fanconi Anemia, MECOM deficiency), calcium channel defects (ORAI1 and STIM1 deficiencies), and other functional platelet defects (LYST, RAB27A, CDC42, TWEAK, ZIP7, ITPKB deficiencies). Accordingly, defects in late stages of megakaryocyte differentiation may lead to thrombocytopenia and have been reported in some IEI, including DiGeorge syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency class I, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and Goods syndrome [ 2 , 10 – 26 ]. On the other hand, secondary thrombocytopenia in IEI patients may be caused by inappropriate immune responses to megakaryocytic precursors or glycoprotein (GP)Ibα, GPIIb/IIIa, and GPIa/IIa complexes on platelets, auto-antibody production, and its removal in the context of autoimmune diseases (e.g. immune thrombocytopenic purpura and Evans syndrome), infectious conditions (e.g. EBV and CMV viral infection, bacterial endocarditis or sepsis), platelet sequestration (e.g. hepatosplenomegaly due to lymphoproliferation or EBV complications), nutritional defects (e.g. abnormal folate metabolism in SLC46A1 and MTHFD1 deficiencies), microangiopathic complications (e.g. complement deficiencies associated with the hemolytic-uremic syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation), malignancy (e.g. IEI with lymphoma and leukemia infiltrating bone marrow) or certain medications (e.g. vancomycin, NSAID) [ 27 – 31 ]. Based on the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia in IEI patients, various treatments including platelet transfusion, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), immunosuppressants, and splenectomy may be considered as first-line management of thrombocytopenia, along with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or gene therapy as the cornerstone of therapy for the specific underlying IEI [ 32 ]. In the current study, for the first time, we evaluated the frequency of thrombocytopenia in Iranian IEI patients to provide a comprehensive picture of thrombocytopenia as an important complication in IEI patients. Materials and methods Study population Patients registered in the national IEI registry [ 33 , 34 ] with selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD), agammaglobulinemia (AGA), combined immunodeficiency (CID), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hyper immunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and congenital neutropenia (CN) were enrolled in the present study. The clinical diagnosis of IEI was made based on the Middle East and North Africa Diagnosis and Management Guidelines for Inborn Errors of Immunity [ 35 ]. All included patients were followed up at Children’s Medical Center (Pediatrics Center of Excellence affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran). Only IEI patients with a complete medical record were included in this study and those with missing clinical or laboratory data were excluded. The Ethics Committee of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences approved this study and written consent forms were obtained from all patients and/or their legal guardians. Data collection A questionnaire was designed to retrospectively obtain detailed demographic information, clinical manifestation history, and laboratory data by reviewing the medical history (Supplementary File 1). The collected data included current age, gender, age at onset of IEI symptoms, age of IEI diagnosis, delay in diagnosis, vital status, clinical manifestations and immunological data at the time of disease diagnosis. Platelet count data was obtained at two different times: at the time of IEI diagnosis, and the latest visit of the patient. Classification of the patients IEI patients were categorized into two groups, including patients with thrombocytopenia and those without thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count below 150,000/mm 3 and was considered mild in case of 100,000/mm 3 < platelet count < 150,000/mm 3 , moderate in case of 50,000/mm 3 < platelet count < 100,000/mm 3 and severe in case of platelet count < 50,000/mm 3 . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was accomplished using SPSS (version 24) software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to evaluate the normality of data. According to normality test results, data analytics was performed using the T-test or Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables. Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used for qualitative data. P- value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Demographic characteristics A total of 890 patients (male to female ratio, 1.7:1) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were surveyed in the current study: CVID was the most frequent group with 283 patients, followed by CID ( N = 159 patients), CGD ( N = 142 patients), CN ( N = 87 patients), AGA ( N = 80 patients), HIGM syndrome ( N = 70 patients) and symptomatic SIgAD ( N = 69 patients). The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age at the time of study was 202.9 ± 160.5 months. The mean ± SD age at the onset of IEI-related clinical symptoms and the mean ± SD age at IEI diagnosis for total studied patients were 40.9 ± 83.9 and 85.7 ± 119.9 months, respectively. 465 cases (52.2%) had parental consanguinity. Frequency of thrombocytopenia and its severity The detailed data on the frequency and severity of thrombocytopenia among total IEI patients and 7 IEI groups is presented in Table 1 . Thrombocytopenia was found in 26.6% of total patients (237 out of 890 cases). Most of the thrombocytopenic patients presented severe thrombocytopenia (87 cases, 36.7%). When we compared the frequency and severity of thrombocytopenia among seven IEI groups, we found a significant difference between groups ( P -value < 0.001 and P -value = 0.01, respectively, Table 1 ). CID patients presented the predominant frequency of thrombocytopenia (81 cases, 50.9%), while the lowest frequency was observed in SIgAD patients (6 cases, 8.7%) (Table 1 ). Regarding severity, we noticed that a higher proportion of severe thrombocytopenia is predominantly found in AGA patients (7 cases, 53.8%), while mild type is mostly observed in CN patients (12 cases, 60%).

Among the comparative analyses of clinical manifestations in IEI patients, the interesting finding was the higher frequency of lymphoproliferative signs (hepatomegaly or splenomegaly) in thrombocytopenic patients in comparison to non-thrombocytopenic patients. In this regard, hepatomegaly was more common in the thrombocytopenic group than in the non-thrombocytopenic group among patients with CGD (30.8% vs. 13.2%), CN (25% vs. 4.5%), CVID (38.8% vs. 18.7%), CID (25.9% vs. 23.1%), HIGM syndrome (57.9% vs. 13.7%) and AGA (30.8% vs. 9%), and this difference was statistically significant in CN, CVID, HIGM syndrome and AGA ( P < 0.05). As mentioned, splenomegaly was more frequent in the thrombocytopenic group compared with the non-thrombocytopenic group among patients with CGD (30.8% vs. 15.5%), CN (25% vs. 7.5%), CVID (52.9% vs. 26.3%), CID (32.1% vs. 16.7%), HIGM syndrome (68.4% vs. 19.6%) and AGA (7.7% vs. 6%), and the difference was significant in CN, CVID, CID and HIGM syndrome ( P < 0.05). The distribution of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and their link with lymphadenopathy among lymphoproliferative manifestations within thrombocytopenic patients of studied IEI groups is shown in Fig. 1 . Furthermore, we found higher frequency of autoimmunity in the thrombocytopenic group than in the non-thrombocytopenic group in CVID (57.6% vs. 40.4%), SIgAD (33.3% vs. 11.1%), HIGM syndrome (47.4% vs. 19.6%) and AGA (23.1% vs. 16.4%), and this difference was significant in CVID and HIGM syndrome ( P < 0.05).

Regarding immune cells, the frequency of B cells was significantly higher in the thrombocytopenic patients with CGD (mean: 33.1% vs. 19.3%, P = 0.038), while the thrombocytopenic patients with CID had a significantly higher residual T cells (mean: 32% vs. 18.6%, P = 0.019) when compared to those with the non-thrombocytopenic patients in their respective groups. The thrombocytopenic patients with AGA also had a significantly lower frequency of T cells compared with the non-thrombocytopenic patients with AGA (mean: 72.7% vs. 83.8%, P = 0.016). The thrombocytopenic patients with SIgAD exhibited a remarkably lower frequency of total lymphocytes compared with the non-thrombocytopenic patients with SIgAD (mean: 24.1% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.002). Other comparative analyses of laboratory data are provided in Tables S1-S7. Genetic findings A total number of 41 thrombocytopenic patiets were genetically evaluated. Figure 3 manifests the distribution of mutated genes among these patients. Lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor protein ( LRBA ) and CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) had the highest frequency followed by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( BTK ). Among the total genetically studied thrombocytopenic patients, 17 patients had mild thrombocytopenia, while 13 and 11 patients had moderate and severe thrombocytopenia, respectively. Figure 4 manifests the distribution of thrombocytopenia severity among found genetic mutations.

There was a significant association between mortality and thrombocytopenia (frequency of death: 49.5% in total thrombocytopenic patients vs. 19.3% in total non-thrombocytopenic patients, P < 0.001). Also, frequency of death was remarkably higher in thrombocytopenic patients than non-thrombocytopenic ones in patients with CVID (43.4% vs. 20.3%, P -value < 0.001), CID (61.7% vs. 33.3%, P < 0.001), HIGM syndrome (55.6% vs. 17.4%, P = 0.002) and AGA (41.7% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.022). Discussion Thrombocytopenia is one of the common complications among IEI patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to exclusively evaluate the frequency of thrombocytopenia in various IEI. We observed that thrombocytopenia manifested in 26.6% of our study population, with the highest frequency in patients with CID. Interestingly, we found a significant association between thrombocytopenia and lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity in most of our studied IEI. Pathogenesis of cytopenias in IEI is multifactorial. In this regard, dysfunction and/or dysregulation of humoral and cellular immunity, autoinflammation, hemophagocytosis, bone marrow diseases like primary bone marrow failure, infection-induced myelosuppression, myelofibrosis or malignancy, recent immunizations or transfusions, transplantation, cytotoxic drugs, cytoskeletal and megakaryocyte dysfunction as well as splenic platelet destruction secondary to lymphoproliferation have been reported as contributing factors to thrombocytopenia in IEI [ 36 – 41 ]. In our study, patients with CID and CVID had the highest frequency of thrombocytopenia (50.9% and 30%, respectively). The frequency of thrombocytopenia in our CVID patients is higher (30%) than in other studies reporting a frequency of 7% in Sweden and 20% in France [ 42 , 43 ]. This might be due to higher awareness of IEI in European countries, earlier diagnosis, prophylaxis and management of these patients. In addition to the aforementioned IEI with primary cytopenias, IEI with underlying immune dysregulation such as hemophagocytosis and oligoclonal or polyclonal lymphoproliferation could lead to secondary cytopenias [ 36 , 44 ]. The mechanism of cytopenias in IEI with lymphoproliferation could be attributed to the sequestration of blood cells [ 36 ]. Interestingly, we found a significant association between thrombocytopenia and lymphoproliferation (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy) among patients with CN, CVID, CID, HIGM syndrome and AGA. In line with our findings, a study has reported a synergic correlation between AICs and splenomegaly in CVID [ 42 ]. Although we did not observe a an association between pulmonary manifestations of thrombocytopenic patients and non-thrombocytopenic ones, except for a significantly higher frequency of sinusitis and otitis media in thrombocytopenic SIgAD patients in comparison to non-thrombocytopenic SIgAD patients, a recent study has reported an association between granulomatous–lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) and cytopenias and immune dysregulation in form of hepatosplenomegaly in CVID paients [ 45 ]. This highlights the need for further imaging or histological work-up in patients with overlapping pulmonary and hematologic features. IEI with intrinsic B cell defects or those with disturbed regulation or interaction between T and B cells contribute to auto-antibody production [ 36 , 46 , 47 ], while IEI with intrinsic T-effector cell defects may develop cellular autoimmunity [ 36 , 48 , 49 ]. AICs are the most prevalent autoimmune manifestations in IEI patients, with an approximate prevalence of 10.2–84.1% [ 50 – 52 ]. Several studies have demonstrated that a significant number of cases with AICs may have an underlying IEI, particularly in the co-occurrence of lymphoproliferation, highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between hematologists and immunologists in the evaluation and management of AICs [ 37 , 53 – 56 ]. AICs in IEI patients often fail to respond to first-line therapies for cytopenias including IVIg and/or corticosteroids, thus a prompt diagnosis of the underlying etiology for cytopenias is pivotal for definitive treatment of them [ 53 – 55 , 57 ]. Our findings and others suggest that the manifestation of lymphoproliferation and AICs can be considered a key diagnostic point for earlier diagnosis of an underlying IEI [ 57 ]. Early diagnosis is pivotal in targeted therapies or definitive treatments such as HSCT or gene therapy [ 57 ]. A recent study on IEI patients with cytopenias at presentation in South Africa reported remarkable shorter overall survival in those with thrombocytopenia and other cytopenias at presentation [ 55 ]. Similarly, thrombocytopenic patients in our study had significantly higher mortality compared to non-thrombocytopenic patients. Physicians should be aware of the consequences of chronic, relapsing or refractory thrombocytopenia and other cytopenias in IEI and regularly follow up IEI patients for possible cytopenias, their mechanism and timely appropriate treatment based on the underlying IEI type. While our study provides valuable insights into the frequency of thrombocytopenia in a large cohot of patients with IEI, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. First, due to the retrospective design and variability in available clinical documentation, we were unable to stratify thrombocytopenia cases into immune versus non-immune categories. Therefore, our findings reflect the overall prevalence of thrombocytopenia in patients with IEI, without distinction regarding underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, data on treatment strategies, lines of therapy, and patient responses were not consistently available across cases, preventing us from analyzing the therapeutic approaches and outcomes. These limitations underscore the need for prospective, standardized data collection in future studies to better characterize the nature and management of thrombocytopenia in the context of IEI. Conclusion Understanding the distribution of thrombocytopenia in IEI patients enlightens physicians for earlier diagnosis of an underlying IEI. The significant association between thrombocytopenia and lymphoproliferation as well as autoimmunity highlights the importance of paying attention to these clinical features for suspecting IEI disorders as well as multidisciplinary care and early genetic screening in managing cytopenic complications of IEI patients. Implementation of further studies to clarify the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in various genetic defects associated with IEI could lead to the development of proper diagnostic and therapeutic techniques as well as improved quality of life of these patients.

  "plain_text": "Background Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are inherited defects of innate or adaptive immune system. Thrombocytopenia is a significant multifactorial complication in IEI patients leading to severe clinical consequences including coagulative disorders and vasculopathies. Methods In the present study, we assessed frequency of thrombocytopenia in the most common IEI including combined immunodeficiency (CID), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD), agammaglobulinemia (AGA), hyper immunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and congenital neutropenia (CN). Also, we compared demographic, clinical and laboratory data between IEI patients with and without thrombocytopenia. Results A total of 890 patients (37% female) were included in this study. The frequency of thrombocytopenia in total IEI was 26.6%. Patients with CID and SIgAD had the highest and lowest frequency of thrombocytopenia (50.9% and 8.7%), respectively. Although rare, thrombocytopenia was more severe (< 50000/ul) among patients with AGA compared to other IEI entities. Notably hepatosplenomegaly and autoimmunity were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia and higher mortality in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies. Conclusion The significant association between thrombocytopenia with lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity emphasizes the importance of paying attention to these clinical features for suspecting IEI disorders. Understanding the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in various genetic defects associated with IEI is required for the development of proper diagnostic and therapeutic techniques as well as improved quality of life of these patients.
