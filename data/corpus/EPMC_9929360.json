  "abstract_text": "Clinical databases are becoming commonplace in healthcare environments. However, clinicians have been unable to readily explore these information sources, because currently available data retrieval tools require substantial technical skill, as well as knowledge of the underlying database structures. To address this, we have defined a group of \"atomic\" queries, including both population-based and temporal predicates, to enable the extraction of clinically meaningful information form these databases. DXtractor is an application that incorporates this functionality, and allows clinicians to simply combine these atomic queries. In doing so, arbitrarily complex data retrieval and exploration becomes possible for the non-programming clinician.",
