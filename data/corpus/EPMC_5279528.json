    "abstract_text": "Human placental lactogen has been found to resemble human pituitary growth hormone very closely in amino acid sequence, about 80% of the residues examined being identical in the two molecules when a revised sequence for growth hormone is used as the basis for comparison. The structural features responsible for the differing biological potency of the two hormones may therefore reside in rather limited regions of primary structure. The observation of internal sequence homologies within the pituitary growth hormone and prolactin and the placental lactogen molecules suggests that these polypeptide hormones may have evolved by genetic reduplication from a smaller common ancestral peptide. This finding directs further attention to subfragments of these molecules as possible possessors of intrinsic somatotrophic and lactogenic activity.",
