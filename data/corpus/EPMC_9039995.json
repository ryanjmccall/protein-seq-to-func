    "abstract_text": "We present data to suggest the existence of a mental retardation (MR) locus at Xq11.2-q12 between DXS1 and DXS905, identified in two subjects with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) and MR. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a disorder of male sexual differentiation caused by a defect in the androgen receptor (AR) gene (Xq11-q12). Two subjects with CAIS resulting from a complete deletion of the AR gene have previously been reported, one of whom also has MR. We have identified another mentally retarded person with a complete deletion of the AR gene. The deletion in the two patients with CAIS and MR extends past the AR gene and includes several marker loci both proximal and distal to the AR gene, the limits of the deletions being DXS1 and DXS905. The deletions in the CAIS patients who do not have MR do not include any of the markers outside the AR gene itself. These data suggest that located close to the AR gene is a gene which is implicated in non-specific MR.",
