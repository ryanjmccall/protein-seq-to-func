  "abstract_text": "3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates the activation loop of a number of protein serine/threonine kinases of the AGC kinase superfamily, including protein kinase B (PKB; also called Akt), serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, protein kinase C isoforms, and the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase. PDK1 contains a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, which targets phosphoinositide lipids at the plasma membrane and is central to the activation of PKB. However, PDK1 subcellular trafficking to other compartments is not well understood. We monitored the posttranslational modifications of PDK1 following insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulation. PDK1 underwent rapid and transient phosphorylation on S396, which was dependent upon plasma membrane localization. Phosphorylation of S396 was necessary for nuclear shuttling of PDK1, possibly through its influence on an adjacent nuclear export sequence. Thus, mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1 provides a means for directed PDK1 subcellular trafficking, with potential implications for PDK1 signaling.",
