  "title": "A regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase increases the nuclear accumulation of X-box-binding protein-1 to modulate the unfolded protein response.",

  "abstract_text": "Class Ia phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), an essential mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin, is composed of a catalytic (p110alpha or p110beta) and regulatory (p85alphaalpha, p85betaalpha or p55alpha) subunit. Here we show that p85alphaalpha interacts with X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), a transcriptional mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent manner. Cell lines with knockout or knockdown of p85alphaalpha show marked alterations in the UPR, including reduced ER stress-dependent accumulation of nuclear XBP-1, decreased induction of UPR target genes and increased rates of apoptosis. This is associated with a decreased activation of inositol-requiring protein-1alpha (IRE1alpha) and activating transcription factor-6alphaalpha (ATF6alpha). Mice with deletion of p85alpha in liver (L-Pik3r1(-/-)) show a similar attenuated UPR after tunicamycin administration, leading to an increased inflammatory response. Thus, p85alphaalpha forms a previously unrecognized link between the PI3K pathway, which is central to insulin action, and the regulation of the cellular response to ER stress, a state that when unresolved leads to insulin resistance.",
