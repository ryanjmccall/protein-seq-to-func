    "abstract_text": "The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-deleted in tumor (LRP1B, initially referred to as LRP-DIT) was cloned and characterized as a candidate tumor suppressor. It is a new member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. Its overall domain structure and large size (approximately 600 kDa) are similar to LRP and suggest that it is a multifunctional cell surface receptor. Herein, we characterize a series of ligands for the receptor using cell lines that stably express it as a domain IV minireceptor (mLRP1B4). Ligands of LRP including receptor-associated protein, urokinase plasminogen activator, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 each demonstrate binding, internalization, and degradation via mLRP1B4. Interestingly, the kinetics of ligand endocytosis is distinctly different from that of LRP, with LRP1B exhibiting a markedly diminished internalization rate. In addition, tissue expression analysis reveals that the LRP1B gene is expressed in brain, thyroid, and salivary gland. These studies thus extend the physiological roles of members of the LDL receptor family.",
