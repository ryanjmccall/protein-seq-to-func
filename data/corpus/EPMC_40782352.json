SUMMARY To overcome the paucity of known tumor-specific surface antigens in pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG), we contrasted splicing patterns in pHGGs and normal brain samples. Among alternative splicing events affecting extracellular protein domains, the most pervasive alteration was the skipping of \u226430-nt-long exons. Several of these skipped microexons mapped to L1-immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule (IgCAM) family members, such as neuronal CAM ( NRCAM ). Bulk and single-nuclei short- and long-read RNA-seq revealed uniform skipping of NRCAM microexons 5 and 19 in virtually every pHGG sample. Importantly, the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 (but not the full-length) NRCAM proteoform was essential for pHGG cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo . We developed a monoclonal antibody selective for \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM and demonstrated that \u201cpainting\u201d pHGG cells with this antibody enables killing by T cells armed with an FcRI-based universal immune receptor. Thus, pHGG-specific NRCAM and possibly other L1-IgCAM proteoforms are promising and highly selective targets for adoptive immunotherapies. In brief Aberrant splicing of microexons yields non-canonical surface receptors, such as the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) lacking amino acids encoded by exons 5 and 19. Sehgal et al. show that \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM is essential for high-grade glioma growth and that its targeting by monoclonal antibodies enables in vitro killing by T cells. Graphical Abstract INTRODUCTION Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are some of the most recalcitrant, chemoresistant, and often surgically unresectable childhood cancers. For example, children affected by diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) nearly universally succumb to the disease within 8\u201310 months of diagnosis. 1 Its adult counterpart, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is equally lethal. 2 Currently, there are no effective standard-of-care therapies for these patients, despite decades of molecularly agnostic clinical trials, underscoring the importance of developing novel immunotherapies. Several targets for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in GBM have been developed, most notably EGFRvIII, 3 , 4 HER2, 5 interleukin-13 receptor \u03b12 (IL-13R\u03b12), 6 and Eph2A, 7 but so far, the corresponding immunotherapeutics enjoyed limited success in the clinic, owing in part to the frequent emergence of antigen escape variants (reviewed in Petersen and Krenciute, 8 Migliorini et al., 9 Larson and Maus, 10 and Maggs et al. 11 ). Although GBMs and pHGGs are thought to arise in the same lineage, the latter express somewhat different repertoires of surface antigens. Validated pHGG targets include GD2 and B7-H3 (reviewed in Patterson et al. 12 and Lin et al. 13 ). GD2 in particular is highly expressed by H3K27M-mutated DMG cells, 14 and the first 4 patients with DMG were recently treated with anti-GD2 CAR, with some clinical and radiographic improvement. 15 Similarly, both anaplastic astrocytomas and DMGs express B7-H3 (also known as CD276), and an anti-B7-H3 CAR has shown activity in preclinical models of pediatric tumors. 16 However, targeting GD2 is associated with well-documented (although not universally observed) on-target, off-tumor toxicities (OTOTs), 17 , 18 and side effects of another anti-B7-H3 CAR have been only assessed in the mouse 19 and in a relatively small cohort of human patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). 20 , 21 Even if GD2- and/or B7-H3-directed immunotherapies become standards of care, the clinical use of CAR T cells in patients with hematologic malignancies suggests that there is no such thing as the \u201cperfect\u201d target, and there cannot be too many alternatives 22 , 23 ; the more cancer specific, the better. 24 Here, we describe our effort to systemically identify new targets using the pHGG model where mutation burden is typically low and aberrant mRNA splicing is a key post-transcriptional mechanism of proteome diversification. 25 This effort has led to the identification of the four members of the L1-immunoglobulin (Ig) sub-family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), in particular the neuronal CAM (NRCAM) splice variant, as promising targets for adoptive T cell therapy. RESULTS Identification of microexon-derived surface proteoforms in pHGG Our initial analysis of 325 pHGG tumors from the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas 26 revealed that not only is aberrant splicing prevalent in pHGG, but these tumors had some of the most heterogeneous splicing programs. 25 Thus, the rMATS-turbo splicing algorithm 27 was used to compare 184 pHGG patient samples to each of the 7 healthy controls, comprising an adult brain homogenate, an adult brain stem, an adult cerebellum, an adult occipital cortex, two fetal brains, and one pediatric normal cortex. pHGG-specific splice junction candidates were filtered for single-exon (SE) events, whose junctions were mapped to predicted protein structures using UniProt annotations and filtered for SE events corresponding to extracellular protein domains ( Figure 1A ) to enable future development of therapeutic antibodies and CARs. These events were filtered for \u226540% prevalence and further binned according to exon lengths. The only events with mean differences in percent-spliced-in (\u0394PSI) absolute values greater than 0.50 were the skipping of very short exons: \u226430 and 31\u201350 nt long ( Figure 1B , box). These are known as microexons, 28 and their dysregulation has been previously implicated in several CNS diseases, 29 including autism spectrum disorder. 30 Inclusion of microexons requires dedicated RNA-binding proteins such as RBFOX 31 , 32 and SRRM4, 30 , 33 \u2013 35 whose activity is counteracted by PTBP1, a promoter of microexon skipping. 36 \u2013 38 Of note, the expression levels of RBFOX1 and SRRM4 mRNA were lower and that of PTBP1 were higher in pHGG compared to normal brain tissues ( Figure 1C ), which could explain the observed bias toward microexon skipping. To validate these findings in patient-derived samples, we performed RT-qPCR assays on pooled normal brain RNAs vs. 6 cultured pHGG patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We observed statistically significant differences in RBFOX1 , SRRM4 , and PTBP1 levels, which mirrored those seen in the original datasets ( Figure S1A ). Thus, we re-analyzed the entire rMATS-turbo output focusing on microexons corresponding to cell surface proteins and with |\u0394PSI| \u2265 0.5. We found that mRNAs encoding the 4 members of the L1-Ig superfamily of CAMs (IgCAMs)\u2014 L1CAM itself, NFASC , CHL1 , and NRCAM \u2014were among the most profoundly and consistently mis-spliced transcripts ( Figures 1D and 1E ). In fact, NRCAM mRNA had two microexon-related events: skipping of the 18-nt microexon 5 and the 30-nt microexon 19 (MANE nomenclature 39 ; exons 9 and 23 in GTEx v.8 40 ) ( Figure 1E ). We also observed the skipping of microexon 7 in L1CAM and microexon 24 in NFASC . One exception to the trend toward exon skipping was the increased inclusion of exon 8 in CHL1 , but that exon was slightly longer, 48 nt, which is borderline for the purpose of microexon definition. 29 To validate these findings in patient-derived samples, we performed semi-quantitative, low-cycle-number RT-PCR assays on the samples from Figure S1A . Using forward and reverse primers corresponding to exons flanking microexons in question, we were able to detect both skipping and inclusion events in the same reactions. Without exception, the splicing patterns of the 6 PDXs matched those predicted by rMATS-Turbo ( Figure S1B ). Focusing on NRCAM as the most profoundly affected transcript, we asked whether its microexons are skipped in other human tumors. We queried MAJIQlopedia, our recently developed compendium of splicing variations across 86 human tissues and 41 cancer datasets. 41 We found that the skipping of NRCAM exons 5 and 19 was prevalent in all tumor types with detectable NRCAM splice junctions. They included pHGG, adult low-grade gliomas and GBMs, pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, and also cancers of non-neural origins, such as lung adenocarcinomas ( Figure 1F ). The sole exception was pediatric neuroblastoma, where NRCAM exons 5 and 19 were uniformly included. Of note, these splicing quantifications were based on MAJIQ, 42 an algorithm orthogonal to rMATS-turbo, increasing our confidence in NRCAM -centric events. Further evidence for preferential NRCAM exon 5 and 19 skipping in pHGG was found in the output of Toil, yet another orthogonal approach to transcript reconstitution from short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. 43 Finally, using the Xena portal, 44 we observed that transcript ENST00000351718.8, lacking exons 5 and 19, was overexpressed in brainstem gliomas compared to normal brain tissues ( Figure 1G ). ENST00000351718.8 was also upregulated in GBMs, consistent with the MAJIQlopedia output ( Figure S2A ). HGG-specific expression of the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoform To determine whether microexon skipping reflects, at least to some extent, pHGG lineage, we included in the analysis the RNA-seq dataset corresponding to 20 human primary astrocyte samples, 1 neuron sample, and 4 oligodendrocytes. 45 We observed that the skipping of HGG-specific microexons occurred primarily in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not neurons, consistent with the pHGG eponymous cell of origin ( Figure 2A ). PSI values, while reflective of the underlying molecular mechanism, do not yield information about the expression levels of a given isoform, which are much more relevant from the immunotherapy standpoint. Thus, we complemented our rMATS-turbo analysis with the parsing of splice junction counts, one of the key outputs of the STAR aligner, 46 as described by us recently. 47 Specifically, we quantified expression of the non-canonical exon 4-exon 6 junctions in pHGG samples and across the GTEx dataset comprising both neuronal and non-neuronal normal tissues. The B7-H3/CD276 constitutive exon 15-exon 16 junction was used for comparison. We observed that \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM and B7-H3 transcripts were expressed at comparable levels in pHGG and brain sub-regions, while \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM had the advantage of being expressed at lower levels in non-neuronal normal organs, such as the adrenal gland and adipose tissue ( Figure 2B ). Similar results were obtained using the NRCAM exon 18-exon 20 junction as a readout ( Figure S2B , top left) The other three members of the L1CAM family showed the same pattern of selective exon usage, except that their expression levels in pHGG were markedly lower ( Figure S2B , top right and bottom). To determine whether skipping of NRCAM microexons 5 and 19 occurs concurrently and in the context of functional, cap-to-poly (A) transcripts, we performed direct cDNA long-read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore platform PromethION P2 for two DMG PDX samples, 7316\u20131763 and 7316\u20131769. To ensure accurate detection of small exons, STAR-aligned reads were re-aligned using MisER. 48 We observed the skipping of both NRCAM exon 5 and exon 19 in PDX 7316\u20131769 ( Figure 2C ); however, due to low read depth, we could not detect any transcripts for NRCAM in PDX 7316\u20131763. To circumvent the read depth issue, we performed targeted long-read re-sequencing on several PDX samples, the KNS42 pHGG cell line, TM31 and U251 GBM cell lines, and the SMS-SAN neuroblastoma cell line. Direct examination of sequencing reads in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV 49 ) revealed that all oligo(dT)-primed NRCAM transcripts extending to the 5\u2032 end lacked exons 5 and 19 in KNS42 cells but included them at ~50% frequency in SMS-SAN NBL cells ( Figures 2D and 2E ). Using the ESPRESSO computational tool, 50 we quantified the expression of various NRCAM transcripts in all sequenced samples. We observed that all pHGG and GBM cell lines and PDXs predominantly expressed the NRCAM variant lacking both exon 5 and exon 19 ( Figure 2F , blue, gray, and yellow bars), while in SMS-SAN cells, the inclusion of exon 19 was common (orange bar), and the skipping of both exon 5 and exon 19 was rather rare. Assessment of tumor heterogeneity by single-cell long-read-seq Bulk long-read RNA-seq is commonly used to identify full-length transcripts, but initially, it did not have single-cell-resolution capabilities. 51 , 52 Subsequent single-cell long-read approaches were developed for fewer than 100 cells, 53 , 54 making the assessment of tumor heterogeneity difficult. To overcome this limitation, we recently developed techniques for long-read sequencing of thousands of single cells from both fresh (ScISOr-seq 55 ) and frozen (SnISOr-seq 56 ) tissues. The most recent iteration of this approach (SnISOr-seq/ScISOr-ATAC 56 , 57 ) allows for the accurate cataloging of full-length transcripts devoid of intronic sequences. We applied this approach to DMG PDX 7316\u20133058. According to the short-read dataset (the 10\u00d7 Genomics part of the workflow), this sample can be broken down into 3 clusters based on k -means ( Figure 3Ai ). While all of them expressed glial cell markers, proliferating cells were largely confined to cluster 2, as evidenced by expression of the MKI67 gene ( Figure 3Aii ). Nevertheless, virtually all neoplastic cells, regardless of cluster attribution, expressed both B7-H3 ( Figure 3Aiii ) and NRCAM ( Figure 3Aiv ) mRNAs, especially robustly the latter. Then, using the long-read dataset (the Oxford Nanopore part of the workflow), we asked how microexons of interest are represented in 3 major clusters (A, B, and C in Figure 3B ). This was achieved by retaining barcoded reads only and aligning them over the GRCh39 genome using minimap2 with GENCODE v.44 GTF as described earlier. 58 When we examined ScisorWiz 56 plots, we observed that all recovered reads for NRCAM exons 4 and 6 skipped microexon 5 (blue dotted rectangle), and all recovered reads for CHL1 exons 7 and 9 included microexon 8 (red rectangle), with no evidence of intra- or intercluster heterogeneity. This was in sharp contrast to the CHL1 \u201cnon-micro\u201d cassette exon 26, whose inclusion and skipping varied considerably both within and among the 3 clusters (purple rectangle). Collectively, these results suggest that in pHGG, L1-CAM microexons are processed in a uniform rather than a stochastic manner, making the corresponding proteoforms much more compelling immunotherapy targets. To validate these findings in additional pHGG samples, we parsed data from a recent study wherein bulk and single-cell RNA-seq were performed on 19 pHGG primary samples 59 (NCBI GEO: GSE231859). Non-cancerous samples were excluded, as were samples annotated as epithelioid glioblastoma or with fewer than 200 neoplastic cells. The bulk sequencing reads corresponding to the remaining 8 samples were visualized in IGV, with an emphasis on NRCAM exons 5 and 19. As anticipated, we observed predominant patterns of exon 19 and especially exon 5 skipping, with 5 out of 8 samples not containing any exon 5 reads ( Figure S3A ). Then, single-cell sequencing reads were integrated and analyzed using the Seurat and Azimuth packages, 60 \u2013 63 and cell types were mapped using the Human Motor Cortex Reference Explorer. When all cell types were included in the analysis, NRCAM and B7-H3 showed similar patterns of intertumoral heterogeneity ( Figure S3B ). However, after zeroing in on the glial compartments (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells [OPCs]; Figure S4A ), we observed much more robust and more uniform distribution of NRCAM mRNAs than B7-H3 mRNAs, with fewer dropout events ( Figures S4B and S4C ), attesting to NRCAM\u2019s potential as an immunotherapy target. The role of \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM in pHGG pathogenesis To determine the contribution of \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM to gliomagenesis, we first designed a guide RNA mapping to NRCAM exon 4 ( Figure S5A ) and used it in combination with the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate NRCAM -null (knockout [KO]) KNS42 cells. The KO event was validated at the genomic DNA level by amplicon re-sequencing ( Figure S5B ) and at the protein level by immunoblotting with a commercially available anti-NRCAM antibody ( Figure 4A ). To determine whether the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoform is expressed on the plasma membrane, we adapted a whole-cell biotinylation assay. Briefly, live KNS42 cells were incubated with biotin to label Lys residues of surface proteins, which, upon lysis, were isolated using neutravidin beads and analyzed by immunoblotting. In these subcellular localization experiments, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) served as a reference cell surface marker and tubulin and actin as cytosolic markers. We reliably observed the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoform in both total cell lysate and the cell surface but not cytosolic (\u201cflow-through\u201d) fractions, and it was largely absent from all NRCAM KO cell fractions ( Figure 4B ). This result is in line with multiple reports showing that microexon-encoded amino acids are often located on outer surfaces and regulate protein-protein interactions, as cataloged in a recent review (Table 1 in Mackensen and Irimia 64 ). To determine the role of the skipped isoform of NRCAM in pHGG, we reconstituted NRCAM KO cells with the full-length (exon 5-/exon 19-including) and the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoforms and confirmed their expression by immunoblotting ( Figure 4C ). Compared to vector control cells, neither of them showed any effect on cell proliferation in 2D cultures ( Figure 4D ). However, the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19, but not the full-length, NRCAM isoform enhanced migration and invasion by KNS42 cells, as evidenced by the Transwell assays performed without and with Matrigel layers, respectively ( Figures 4E and 4F ), as described by us previously. 65 Finally, we modified these cells to express firefly luciferase and implanted them orthotopically into the cortices of non-obesediabetic severe combined immunodeficiency gamma (NSG) mice, as described previously. 66 We observed more consistent tumor take and substantially more robust tumor growth when the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoform was expressed, whereas both NRCAM -null and NRCAM -full-length KNS42 cells established and grew rather poorly ( Figures 4G and 4H ). In fact, mice bearing these tumors were still alive on day 120, while their \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 counterparts were all dead by day 30 ( Figure 4I ). The apparent essentiality of \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 for tumor growth and its uniform expression on the cell surface made it an even more attractive target for pHGG immunotherapy. pHGG-selective anti-NRCAM antibodies and their therapeutic utility Given the minimal difference in the amino acid sequences between the full-length and the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM proteoforms, we used AlphaFold 3 67 to predict 3D structural models for the corresponding UniProt-annotated ectodomains. It predicted a \u201chorseshoe\u201d conformation with a hinge between Ig-like 2 and Ig-like 3 domains in both isoforms, similar to crystal structures of another L1 family member, L1CAM 68 (discussed in Hortsch et al. 69 ). AlphaFold 3 also predicted that the proline-rich microexon 19-encoded amino acid sequence creates a sharp bend between the Ig-like 6 domain and the first fibronectin type-III domain ( Figure 5A , left). This bend is absent from the NRCAM \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 proteoform model, creating a more open conformation that could be available for selective targeting ( Figure 5A , right). To generate \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM-selective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we expressed this isoform in murine NIH3T3 cells and immunized syngeneic C57BL/J mice with whole cells using the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Antibody Technology Core Facility ( Figure 5B ), as described by others previously. 70 Supernatants from the resultant hybridomas were used to stain CHO cells expressing either the full-length or the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM proteoform. As expected, the majority of mAbs (exemplified by 2D10 in Figure 5C ) stained both the full-length and the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoforms equally well (gray arrows). However, mAb 3F8 showed selectivity for \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM, as judged by the ~10-fold difference in mean fluorescent intensities ( Figure 5D , gray and orange arrows). Importantly, this binder recognized the endogenously expressed \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM in pHGG samples, such as the KNS42 cell line ( Figure 5E , purple peak with orange arrow), even though non-specific, background staining was also observed in NRCAM KO cells (green peak). We also stained 4 pHGG PDXs with 3F8. Consistent with single-cell RNA-seq data ( Figures S3 and S4 ), we observed robust and uniform expression of \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM ( Figure 5F ). To determine how efficient and selective 3F8-based immunotherapeutics might be, we applied universal immune receptor (UIR) technology to redirect T cell specificity toward antibody-stained cells, as described by us previously. 71 \u2013 73 Specifically, we \u201cpainted\u201d KNS42 cells with the 3F8 antibody and admixed them in vitro with human donor-derived T cells engineered to express a CD64 (Fc gamma receptor I; Fc\u03b3RI)-based UIR ( Figure 5G ). We observed that this antibody-UIR combination could kill the majority of pHGG cells, but only when the cancer cells expressed the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM proteoform, ectopically or endogenously (KNS42 or PDX 7316\u20133058 cells) ( Figure 6A , top row). No killing was observed against cells expressing full-length NRCAM, or when the Fc\u03b3RI UIR was armed by an irrelevant isotype-control IgG2b antibody ( Figure 6A , bottom row), or when using untransduced donor T cells ( Figure S6A ). We further tested the 3F8-UIR combination against adult GBM cell lines U251 and TM31 (which exclusively express the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoform) and their NRCAM KO derivatives. We observed the same efficacy and selectivity of cell killing as seen with pHGG models ( Figures 6B and S6B ). We thus concluded that mAb 3F8 is a promising immunotherapeutic for pediatric and adult tumors of glial origin. DISCUSSION It is well recognized that failures of adoptive cancer immunotherapies come in two flavors: effector cell centric (e.g., T cell exhaustion) and target cell centric (e.g., epitope loss or down-modulation). 74 The latter problem underscores the need for robust pipelines yielding alternative antigens for salvage immunotherapies. Traditionally, such pipelines focused either on the discovery of lineage-specific markers (B cell-specific CD19, CD22, etc.) 75 or on the identification of proteins overexpressed in tumors compared to their respective tissues of origin. While such \u201ctumor-vs.-normal\u201d comparisons continue to yield viable therapeutic targets, for example, DLK1 and GPC2 in high-risk neuroblastoma, 76 , 77 GPC2 in CNS tumors, 78 B7-H3 (CD276) and GD2 in DIPG, and DMG 15 , 20 and GD2 in medulloblastoma, 79 this approach might be entering the phase of diminishing returns, as existing microarray and RNA-seq datasets have been mined extensively already. Additionally, tumor-vs.-normal comparisons often ignore expression of the target antigen in non-adjacent normal tissues, creating the potential for severe OTOTs. 80 For CAR T cells, OTOTs could be circumvented with locoregional delivery, but this approach may not be effective for antibody-drug conjugates and other soluble therapeutics. All these limitations have led the cancer immunotherapy field to look for alternative sources of tumor-specific epitopes, such as alternative splicing. 81 , 82 In a landmark paper investigating splicing patterns across The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was estimated that in the average tumor, there exist close to 1,000 unique \u201cneojunctions\u201d not typically found in normal samples profiled by the GTEx Consortium. 83 However, only a tiny fraction of them (~0.1%) generate peptides capable of being presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. In principle, this bottleneck could be bypassed by focusing on transmembrane proteins with large extracellular domains, which could be recognized by engineered T cells independently of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation. 84 However, it is not clear what fraction of alternatively spliced transcripts yields functional proteoforms able to reach the plasma membrane. In hematologic malignancies, for example, there are several examples where exon skipping results in either protein degradation (P2RX5 85 ) or its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (CD19 86 , 87 and CD33 88 ). Finally, even when alternative splicing-derived proteoforms are expressed on the cell surface, anti-peptide mAbs directed against neojunctions might efficiently and specifically recognize the denatured protein (e.g., CD22 \u0394ex5\u20136 89 ) but not necessarily its membrane-bound conformation. Thus, in most cases, alternative splicing might be just as likely to drive resistance as to enable new therapies. 90 However, not all alternative splicing events are created equal, and some of them, for example, the inclusion/skipping of microexons, have evolved to preserve protein structures while generating unique 3D conformations. 29 , 64 Here, we report that in pHGG, the pattern of microexon inclusion is markedly different from that observed in normal brain samples. In fact, microexon skipping was the only SE type of event with profound differences in \u0394PSI values (>50%). By focusing further on SE events with high prevalence, we were able to identify members of the L1 family of CAMs, 69 including NRCAM, as being particularly strongly affected by alternative splicing. This is not completely surprising, as NRCAM was recently shown to be the molecule with the greatest number of proteoforms in the developing mouse and human retinas. 91 There is also some evidence that NRCAM and related CAMs might be implicated in tumor progression (reviewed in Cavallaro and Christofori 92 ). However, the importance of individual proteoforms in either normal development or cancerous growth has not been elucidated. By focusing on concurrent skipping of NRCAM microexons 5 and 19, we were able to demonstrate that not only the corresponding proteoform is stable and present on pHGG cell surfaces, but it is also essential for cell migration and invasion in vitro and for progressive tumor growth in orthotopic mouse models. Remarkably, despite minimal amino acid changes, it is also antigenically distinct, as we were successful in generating a mAb (3F8) with high selectivity toward \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM. This selectivity manifested itself not only in flow cytometry experiments but also in functional cell-killing assays, where pHGG cells reconstituted with \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM\u2014but not the full-length isoform\u2014were effectively killed by human T cells engineered to express an Fc\u03b3RI-based UIR and redirected by a \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM-specific mAb. These findings provide the rationale for future development and preclinical testing of other 3F8-based immunotherapeutics, including CARs. If 3F8-based immunotherapeutics prove to be as potent as current ones (e.g., B7-H3 CARs), targeting \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM could be advantageous from the OTOT standpoint. Indeed, we observed that this mRNA isoform is expressed at lower levels in several normal tissues, including the adrenal gland. Even in normal brain samples, which have sizable fractions of cells of glial origin, we failed to detect significant levels of \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM expression, as judged by junction-permillion (JPM) counts ( Figure 2B ). In fact, the recently developed Cancer-Specific Exon Miner identified NRCAM as one of the six alternatively spliced proteoforms highly and specifically expressed in multiple solid and brain pediatric tumors with high prevalence. 93 Our data indicate that the potential of \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM as a therapeutic target is not limited to pediatric tumors and could include adult low-grade gliomas and GBMs, pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, and also cancers of non-neural origins, such as lung adenocarcinomas. The rather broad spectrum of \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM expression raises interesting questions about its contribution to neoplastic growth. It could be argued that the skipping of microexons 5 and 19 in pHGGs simply reflects their glial, not neuronal, origin and that normal glia (and by extension, their malignant counterparts) simply do not express the RNA-binding protein machinery necessary to include microexons. While there is some recent experimental and computational support for this \u201cskipping-by-neglect\u201d scenario, 94 several lines of evidence indicate that it may not be universally applicable. First and foremost, the identity of the cell(s) of origin for human HGG is often inferred from mouse lineage-tracing experiments and therefore is not firmly established. 95 Examination of molecular signatures frequently points to the role of OPCs, at least in certain anatomic locations, such as the pons. In contrast, diffuse hemispheric gliomas (of which KNS42 is representative) are now thought to arise from interneuronal precursors. 96 Second, even if most pHGGs do arise from OPCs, glia-specific microexons have also been identified, contradicting the \u201cskipping-by-neglect\u201d hypothesis. 97 Third, intermediate levels of NRCAM exon 19 (but not exon 5) inclusion in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas revealed by MAJIQlopedia argue that these cassettes are dynamically and independently regulated to shape the neoplastic phenotypes of individual tumor types. For example, skipping of NRCAM microexons could regulate its interactions with other members of the L1-IgCAMs 69 , 98 , 99 and the metastasis-promoting proteins of the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin 100 ) family. Elucidation of these interactions could reveal additional opportunities for the targeting of alternative splicing in pediatric gliomas. Limitations of the study Our conclusion that \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM is an attractive target for adoptive T cell therapy is based largely on our success in generating a splice isoform-selective antibody (3F8) and its potency in the in vitro killing assays using UIR-armed T donor cells. We are yet to test these UIR T cells in vivo . Nor have we evaluated the cross-reactivity of 3F8 with normal tissues, given the challenges of performing immunohistochemistry with antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes.

STAR\u2605METHODS EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS Animal experiments All animal experiments had received prior approval from the Children Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were conducted as described in Protocol IAC 24\u2013001295 \u201cValidation of drivers in tumor formation and preclinical testing\u201d (approval date 2/29/2024). The orthotopic pHGG models have been established as follows. Eight to 10-week-old Nu/J mice (8 animals per treatment group) were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, placed into the stereotactic frame, then injected with 1\u00d710 6 glioma cells. Stereotactic coordinates used to target the cortex for tumor were as follows: \u22120.4 mm posterior to bregma, 3 mm lateral to bregma, and 1 mm depth from pia. All animals were subjected to regular optical imaging beginning at 3 weeks post-injection. Human samples All high-grade glioma pediatric brain tumor raw data were harvested from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP) (accession number phs002517.v2.p2), which includes tumors from the Children\u2019s Brain Tumor Network ( https://cbtn.org ) and the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium ( https://pnoc.us/ ). Cell culture The pediatric high-grade glioma cell line KNS42 was cultured in DMEM-F12 (GIBCO Cat#11320033), the neuroblastoma cell line SMS-SAN was cultured in RPMI (Corning Cat#10\u2013040-CM), murine NIH3T3 cells were cultured in IMDM (ThermoFischer Scientific Cat#12440053), Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Ham\u2019s F 12K (Kaighn\u2019s) Medium (ThermoFischer Scientific Cat# 21127022) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO Cat#26140079), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (GIBCO Cat#25030081), and penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO Cat #15140122) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . After thawing, cells were authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis, tested for Mycoplasma using the EZ-PCR Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Biological Industries Cat#20\u2013700-20), and used for up to 12 passages. Patient derived cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Cat#12587\u2013010), N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Cat#175020\u201348), EGF recombinant protein (Thermo Fisher Cat#PHG0311L), FGF recombinant protein (Peprotech Cat#100\u201318B), Heparin (Sigma Cat#H3149), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 , supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . METHOD DETAILS RNA extraction and reverse transcription Total RNAs were isolated using Maxwell RSC simplyRNA Cells kit with the Maxwell RSC48 Instrument (Promega Cat#AS1390) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript IV (Invitrogen Cat#18090010). Primer sequences used for cDNA amplification are listed in the key resources table . Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read direct cDNA sequencing Total RNAs were isolated using Maxwell RSC simplyRNA Cell Kits (Promega Cat#AS1390). Approximately 500 ng of total RNA was used for direct cDNA (SQK-LSK114; Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT]) library preparation. Subsequently, each library was loaded into a PromethION Flow Cell R10.4.1 version (FLO-PRO114M; ONT) and sequenced using a PromethION 2 Solo (ONT) for 48 h. Raw Fast5 files were converted to fastq with guppy (version 3.4.5), followed by alignment to the GENCODE version of hg38 (version 30) using minimap2 (version 2.18); the resulting bam file was visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (version 2.11.0). ONT targeted resequencing For NRCAM, primers were designed to bind to exons present in all the isoforms to ensure full coverage of all alternative splicing events. 5 ng of cDNA were amplified with the long LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) for 25 cycles. The resulting amplicons were subjected to amplicon-seq (SQKNBD112.24, ONT) library preparation. Subsequently, each library was loaded into a Spot-ON flow cell R9 Version (FLO-MIN112, ONT) and sequenced in a MinION Mk1C device (ONT) until it had acquired at least 1000 reads per sample. Acquired reads were aligned using Minimap2 version 2.24-r1122 and visualized in IGV version 2.12.3. When indicated, MisER, a splicing re-alignment tool, was run on ONT output files and reads were realigned using NRCAM RefSeq transcripts downloaded from UCSC genome browser. The flanking region parameter for Miser was 110. For isoform quantitation, ESPRESSO was run with default settings on MisER-realigned bam files. Single-nuclei isoform RNA sequencing Nuclei from pHGG patient-derived organoids were isolated and processed using the Chromium Next Gem Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kit from 10\u00d7 Genomics (kit PN-1000285, chip PN-1000230, dual index kit PN-1000215). For short-read sequencing, the Chromium Single Cell Multiome Gene Expression Library was performed by following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, starting from 8,000 single-nuclei. It was then loaded on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with PE 2 \u00d7 100 paired-end kit, using the following sequencing read lengths: 28 cycles Read1, 10 cycles i7 index, 10 cycles i7 index, and 90 cycles Read2. For long-read sequencing, cDNA obtained from the 10\u00d7 Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kit was used for amplification and exome enrichment. The amplified/enriched cDNA was then sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technology platform starting from ~200 fmol cDNA and using the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK114), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Nanopore Protocol, Amplicons by Ligation, version ACDE_9163_v114_revO_29Jun2022). The ONT library was loaded onto a PromethION sequencer by using PromethION Flow Cell (FLO-PRO114M) and sequenced for 72 h. Base-calling was performed with Guppy by setting the base quality score >7. Genome editing Single-guide RNA targeting NRCAM exon 4 and CAS9 protein were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes were assembled following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. These ribonucleoprotein complexes were transfected into KNS42 and 7316\u20133058 cells using Lipofectamine CRISPR MAX Kit (Invitrogen Cat#CMAX00001) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The effect of gRNA was determined by immunoblotting for NRCAM. Plasmid constructs and viral infections For NRCAM constructs, the coding sequence of the full-length isoform (NM_001193582.2/ENST00000413765.6) and \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM (NM_005010.5/ENST00000351718.8) was synthesized and cloned into the lentiviral backbone (pTwistLentiSFFV puro) by Twist Biosciences. For viral particle production, 293T cells (ATCC) grown to 90% confluence in a 10-cm Petri dish were transfected with 10 \u03bcg of the NRCAM constructs, 2.5 \u03bcg of the pMD2.G (RRID:Addgene_12259) and 7.5 \u03bcg of the psPAX2, (RRID:Addgene_12260) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, #L3000001). Supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, passed through 0.45-\u03bcm PVDF filters, and incubated for 48 h with cells in media containing 10 \u03bcg/mL polybrene (MedChemExpress, Cat#HY112735). After 48 h, culture media were replaced, and cells were incubated with 1.5 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for selection. For FcIR-28z, transfection was performed with a plasmid mix containing the transfer plasmid encoding the Fc binding immune receptor (FcIR) fused to the intracellular TCR and co-stimulatory signaling domains (FcIR-28z), along with packaging plasmids pRSV.REV (RRID:Addgene_12253), pMD2.G, and pVSV-G (RRID:Addgene_138479) in a 15:18:18:7 mass ratio. Lentiviral supernatants were collected at 24- and 48-h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter, and concentrated via ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2.5 h. The final viral preparation was stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Viral titers were determined by transducing HEK 293T cells, and results were expressed as Infection Units per milliliter (IU/mL). Immunoblotting Total cell lysates were prepared from cells using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce Halt Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#78446). After protein transfer to PVDF (Immobilin-p, Millipore Cat#IPVH00010), anti-NRCAM antibody (Abcam Cat#191418, RRID: AB_3697105) and anti-EGFR antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 4267, RRID:AB_2246311) were used. Subsequently, recommended dilutions of horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (Cell signaling, #7074S, RRID:AB_2099233) were added. Enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore, #WBKLS0500) was used to detect bands that were then captured by Chemiluminescence imager (GE Healthcare). For internal normalization, HRP-conjugated antibodies against \u03b2--actin (Cell Signaling Technology Cat #12262S, RRID:AB_2566811), GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 3683, RRID: AB_1642205), or tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 2144, RRID:AB_2210548) were used. Isolation of biotin-labeled cell surface proteins Cell surface biotinylation was performed using Pierce Cell Surface Biotinylation and Isolation Kit (Thermo Fischer scientific Cat#A44390). Briefly, cells were grown to confluency in 10-well dishes, washed with PBS, and labeled with a non-cell-permeable sulfo-NHS biotin analog for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, ice-cold TBS was added to the cells which were collected with a cell scraper and pelleted by centrifugation (500 \u00d7 g, 5 min, 4\u00b0C). To isolate biotin-labeled cell surface proteins, lysates were loaded onto neutravidin agarose columns and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Eluted protein fractions were then analyzed by immunoblotting. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays To assess proliferation, cells were seeded in white 96 well flat bottom plates at a density of 8000 cells per well. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo (CTG) luminescent assay (Promega Cat#G7570). Luminescence was measured using Biotek Synergy 2 plate reader at 24, 48, and 72 h. Corning BioCoat Cell Culture Inserts and Matrigel inserts (Corning, USA) were used for migration and invasion assays, respectively, as described in Stein et al. 58 Briefly, the inserts were rehydrated with plain DME-F12 for 2 h before use. 5\u20137\u00d710 4 cells pre-treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of Mitomycin C were trypsinized and resuspended in serum-free medium and then seeded onto 24-well Transwell chambers with 8-\u03bcm pore membrane in 500 \u03bcL serum-free medium. The lower chamber contained medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After incubation for 22 h, the non-migrated/invaded cells on the upper side of membrane were removed with a cotton swab and the migrated/invaded cells stained with crystal violet and microphotographed. AlphaFold analysis of NRCAM isoform structures AlphaFold 3 models were generated for the UniProt-annotated ectodomains of the full-length and \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM isoforms, specifically C9JYY6 and Q14CA1. The signal peptide at the N terminus (amino acids 1\u201324, per UniProt) was removed before generating the models. Additionally, these isoforms lack the fifth fibronectin type-III domain, owning the exonic structures of the respective mRNAs (ENST00000413765.6 and ENST00000351718.8). Generation of monoclonal antibody against \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM All monoclonal antibodies were generated at the Fred Hutchinson Antibody Technology Core. Briefly, male and female 20-week-old mice were immunized with syngeneic NIH3T3 cells overexpressing \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM. Following a 12+ week boosting protocol, splenocytes were isolated from high-titer-yielding mice and electrofused with FOX-NY myeloma cells. Hybridomas secreting isoform specific antibody were identified and isolated. Antibodies from the picked clones were validated for proteoform binding by flow cytometry using cell-based flow cytometry. Clone 3F8 was subcloned followed by validation for proteoform binding by cell-based flow cytometry using cells expressing empty vector, full length and \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM. Affinity purified IgG2b kappa chains from the hybridoma was further characterized by western blot analysis and flow cytometry staining. Generation of primary T cells with FcIR-28z All primary T cell studies were conducted under approval from the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB). Identified donors provided informed consent, signing forms approved by the IRB. The activation, transduction, and expansion of primary T cells were carried out using standard techniques. Briefly, primary human CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, obtained from healthy donors through the Human Immunology Core (University of Pennsylvania), were combined in a 1:1 ratio in complete medium (CM) supplemented with 100 IU/mL IL-2 (Prometheus Therapeutics and Diagnostics). On day 0, the T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) at a 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio. After 24 h (day 1), T cells were transduced with FcIR-28z lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The culture volume was doubled daily by the addition of fresh CM until day 6, at which point the Dynabeads were removed via magnetic separation. Cells were maintained at a concentration of 0.75 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL in IL-2 supplemented CM until day 10, when IL-2 was withdrawn from the medium to complete the expansion process. The efficiency of T cell transduction was assessed on day 10 by flow cytometry, analyzing for the surface expression of FcIR. Cytotoxicity assays KNS42 and patient-derived target cell lines were transduced with a pLC-luciferase-zsGreen-blasticidin plasmid and subsequently sorted for GFP-positive populations using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Target cells were resuspended in serum-free complete medium (CM) at a concentration of 2\u00d710 5 viable cells/mL, and 100 \u03bcL of cell suspensions were plated per well in a white, opaque-walled, flat-bottom 96-well plate. Cells were cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 to reach a confluency of approximately 70\u201380%. FcIR-28z effector cells were admixed with the antibody 3F8 or its IgG2b isotype control at concentrations of 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 \u03bcg/mL. The \u201cpainting\u201d was performed at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for 45 min in PBS. Following incubation, effector cells were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in serum-free CM. To calculate the effector-to-target (E:T) ratio, three random target cell samples from each cell line were trypsinized and counted for live cells. Based on the counts, effector cells were added to the target cells at 3:1, 10:1, and 30:1 E:T ratios. The appropriate number of effector cells was resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of serum-free CM and added to the corresponding target cell groups. All conditions were tested in triplicate for each target cell line. Plates were centrifuged at 200g for 3 min and then incubated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for 24 h. Following incubation, 100 \u03bcL of medium was carefully removed from each well for further analysis. For luminescence-based viability assessment, D-luciferin was resuspended in PBS at 900 \u03bcg/mL, and 20 \u03bcL was added to each well to achieve a final concentration of 150 \u03bcg/mL. The plates were placed on an orbital shaker (GeneMate) at 500 rpm for 3 min in the dark, then incubated for an additional 3 min at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Luminescence readings were obtained using a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy H4), and cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula: ( 1 - luminescence ( effector + target cells ) / lumines - cence ( target cells ) ) \u00d7 100 . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS RNA-seq analyses rMATS Turbo (v4.1.0) with GENCODE v39 GFF annotations was used to detect alternative splicing events. Paired comparisons were performed between each tumor sample and seven distinct control sets, including brain homogenate (Clontech, #636643), brain stem (Agilent, #540053, adult), fetal brain (Clontech, #636526), cerebellum (Asterand, #63559\u20131156128F), and occipital cortex (Asterand, #38061\u2013113046A4). Additionally, publicly available datasets were incorporated, including fetal brain (SRR4787052) and pediatric normal cortex (SRR7268790, SRR7268791, SRR7268792). Aberrant splicing events were filtered to retain those with \u226510 junction read counts. The filtered results served as the basis for all downstream analyses. For target discovery, we extracted all single-exon (SE) splicing events with a \u0394PSI \u2265 |0.30| or a \u0394PSI \u22650.10 when the control PSI was <.10. Additionally, they had to meet significance thresholds (FDR and p value of <0.05) in all seven comparisons per tumor sample. We then generated BED files representing exons of interest and intersected them with UniProt protein domain topologies using Bedtools (v2.30.0), which allowed identification of exons corresponding to extracellular domains. Boxplots were used to visualize splicing events altered in at least 40% of tumor samples, stratified by exon length into the following categories: 0\u201330 nt, 31\u201350 nt, 51\u2013100 nt, and >100 nt. The plots were color-coded to denote splicing preference (i.e., inclusion or skipping). Scatterplots were generated using the ggscatter function to highlight microexons (<50 nucleotides). All downstream analyses were conducted using R v4.4.0, with plots generated using ggplot2 v3.5.1. For the analysis of isoform expression levels, FASTQ files corresponding to GTEx samples and brain cell subpopulations were downloaded, respectively, from dbGaP (accession number phs000424.v10.p2.c1) and GEO (Project GSE73721) using sratoolkit. Reads were aligned using 2-pass mapping to hg38 genome and GENCODE v39 version. Junctions per million (JPM) were calculated by collating \u201cuniquely mapped reads\u201d column from the \u201cSJ.out.tab\u201d files from the STAR aligner output. Uniquely mapped reads were divided by the total number of reads per sample to normalize these splicing junctions for each sample. Orthotopic transplantations In vivo data in Figure 4H represents a single study. However, considerable effort was expanded to minimize bias, with each replicate treated as a separate experiment. Specifically, each batch of pHGG cells (Empty vector, Full-length NRCAM, \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM) were harvested from 8 cell culture plates (3\u00d78). We then injected 8 mice per group. Both surgeries and orthotopic injections (24 in total) were performed not serially, but independently throughout the day.

    "full_text_abstract": "SUMMARY To overcome the paucity of known tumor-specific surface antigens in pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG), we contrasted splicing patterns in pHGGs and normal brain samples. Among alternative splicing events affecting extracellular protein domains, the most pervasive alteration was the skipping of \u226430-nt-long exons. Several of these skipped microexons mapped to L1-immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule (IgCAM) family members, such as neuronal CAM ( NRCAM ). Bulk and single-nuclei short- and long-read RNA-seq revealed uniform skipping of NRCAM microexons 5 and 19 in virtually every pHGG sample. Importantly, the \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 (but not the full-length) NRCAM proteoform was essential for pHGG cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo . We developed a monoclonal antibody selective for \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM and demonstrated that \u201cpainting\u201d pHGG cells with this antibody enables killing by T cells armed with an FcRI-based universal immune receptor. Thus, pHGG-specific NRCAM and possibly other L1-IgCAM proteoforms are promising and highly selective targets for adoptive immunotherapies.\n\nIn brief Aberrant splicing of microexons yields non-canonical surface receptors, such as the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) lacking amino acids encoded by exons 5 and 19. Sehgal et al. show that \u0394ex5\u0394ex19 NRCAM is essential for high-grade glioma growth and that its targeting by monoclonal antibodies enables in vitro killing by T cells.\n\nGraphical Abstract"
