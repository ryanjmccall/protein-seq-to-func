  "title": "A calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase splice variant in human monocytes. Activation by a two-stage process involving adherence and a subsequent intracellular signal.",

  "abstract_text": "Freshly isolated human monocytes do not express p125(FAK) but upon adherence to substrata activate the highly related calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK), also known as Pyk2, CAKbeta, RAFTK, and FAK2. The monocyte CADTK was 5 kDa smaller than protein from epithelial cells; isolation and sequencing of the monocyte CADTK cDNA revealed a predicted 42-amino acid deletion between the two proline-rich domains of the enzyme. The nucleic acid sequence suggests that the deletion is caused by alternative RNA splicing. This species was also found in T and B lymphocytes and appears to be the predominant form of cytoskeletal associated tyrosine kinase in non-neoplastic, circulating, hematopoietic cells. CADTK was not activated when monocytes maintained in suspension were treated with agents that produce an intracellular calcium (thapsigargin) or protein kinase C (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) signal including a chemokine, RANTES, that binds to the HIV co-receptor, CCK5. In contrast, monocyte adherence to tissue culture plastic-stimulated CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that was enhanced by thapsigargin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and RANTES but that was completely blocked by preincubation with cytochalasin D. When compared with plastic, adherence to fibronectin- or collagen-coated surfaces produced only minimal CADTK activation but permitted significant stimulation by added thapsigargin. These data suggest that in a cell type that lacks p125(FAK), CADTK plays an early role in post-adherence signaling. Its activation involves two stages, cytoskeletal engagement, which is permissive, and co-stimulatory signals (calcium or protein kinase C) generated by extensive cell surface engagement, agonists, or inflammatory chemokines.",
