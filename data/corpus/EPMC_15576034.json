    "abstract_text": "Human Proliferating Cellular Nuclear Antigen (hPCNA), a member of the sliding clamp family of proteins, makes specific protein-protein interactions with DNA replication and repair proteins through a small peptide motif termed the PCNA-interacting protein, or PIP-box. We solved the structure of hPCNA bound to PIP-box-containing peptides from the p66 subunit of the human replicative DNA polymerase-delta (452-466) at 2.6 A and of the flap endonuclease (FEN1) (331-350) at 1.85 A resolution. Both structures demonstrate that the pol-delta p66 and FEN1 peptides interact with hPCNA at the same site shown to bind the cdk-inhibitor p21(CIP1). Binding studies indicate that peptides from the p66 subunit of the pol-delta holoenzyme and FEN1 bind hPCNA from 189- to 725-fold less tightly than those of p21. Thus, the PIP-box and flanking regions provide a small docking peptide whose affinities can be readily adjusted in accord with biological necessity to mediate the binding of DNA replication and repair proteins to hPCNA.",
