  "abstract_text": "Activating germline mutations in the cysteine-rich domain of the RET proto-oncogene are found in >92% of the cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and 85% of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). In virtually 100% of patients with identified mutations one of five cysteines is altered by a missense mutation. In a MEN2A family with 14 affected and 11 unaffected living members, hypercalcemia was diagnosed in eight patients and histological evaluation revealed parathyroid hyperplasia in all cases examined (10/10). No member of this family showed any evidence for the existence of pheochromocytoma. This is the first documentation of a family without pheochromocytoma but with a high incidence of parathyroid disease. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of an unusual heterozygous mutation in exon 11 of the RET proto-oncogene representing a duplication of 12 bp resulting in the insertion of four amino acids between codon 634 (Cys) and 635 (Arg), thus creating an additional cysteine residue.",
