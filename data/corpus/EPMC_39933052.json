In addition, helicases are required for the replication of infectious viruses. Structural studies of small molecule inhibition of helicase action provide insight into their function as molecular machines that convert ATP to mechanical work. This knowledge will aid the discovery and development of new drug therapies for cancer and infectious diseases. Introduction Helicases are a class of motor enzymes that use the energy derived from nucleoside 5′-triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to catalyze the unwinding of complementary strands within duplex nucleic acids. 1 These versatile enzymes are crucial to a range of fundamental cellular functions including replication, recombination, DNA repair, transcription, translation, and RNA splicing. 1 , 2 Their universal presence in prokaryotes and eukaryotes highlights their essential role in all biological processes involving DNA or RNA. 3 , 4 Viral helicases are essential to the replication of pathogens representing pandemic threats such as coronaviruses, alphaviruses, or flaviviruses. 5 Beyond their fundamental roles, the dysregulation of helicases is implicated in a spectrum of human genetic disorders, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. 6 For example, mutations in BLM and WRN helicases can result in Bloom’s and Werner’s syndromes, 4 respectively, both characterized by signs of premature aging resulting from genomic instability. 7 Additionally, the overactivity of helicases, particularly in DNA repair, diminishes the efficacy of DNA-targeting anticancer treatments. 8 , 9 These challenges have prompted efforts to enhance the therapeutic window of chemotherapeutic agents by combining them with helicase-targeting drugs. 9 − 11 Research and development efforts have also been focused on targeting viral helicases. This antiviral therapeutic strategy was validated with amenamevir (Amenalief), the first approved helicase inhibitor. 12 It is a marketed helicase–primase inhibitor displaying efficacy against both herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), even in cases resistant to other treatments. 13 It has been successfully used in over 1.2 million patients in Japan, displaying a favorable safety profile with fewer adverse reactions compared to other antiherpetic drugs. 13 Amenamevir inhibits the helicase–primase complex with an IC 50 of 0.078 μM against the DNA dependent ATPase activity of the HSV-1 helicase complex. 14 It is believed to target a binding pocket lined by the conserved helicase motif IV, which forms the functional active site essential for DNA helicase, primase, and ssDNA-ATPase activity. 15 In the absence of a crystal structure, the exact structural mechanism is not firmly established. BAY 57-1293 (Pritelivir) , in Phase 3 clinical trials ( clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03073967), inhibits the HSV helicase–primase with a probably related mechanism of action. 16 Other promising helicase inhibitors are currently advancing through clinical trials. MOMA-313 is an oral polymerase theta helicase inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical studies ( clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06545942) investigated as a monotherapy and in combination with PARP inhibitors for patients with solid tumors harboring DNA repair gene alterations (ex. prostate, pancreatic, and breast cancer). 17 , 18 HRO761 is a Werner (WRN) helicase inhibitor 19 investigated in Phase I studies ( clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT05838768) for its antitumor activity in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer and other solid tumors. 19 Advanced preclinical-stage helicase inhibitors include ABI-5366 and MOMA-341. ABI-5366 is a long-acting helicase–primase inhibitor that targets HSV for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes, 20 , 21 while MOMA-341, another WRN helicase inhibitor, is being developed for cancers with microsatellite instability and is projected to enter clinical trials in early 2025. 17 Although proof-of-concept was established for helicase-targeting drug discovery, very few compounds have been clinically validated, and the molecular mechanisms of only a handful have been characterized. 12 Here, we systematically survey and compare the structural mechanism of ligands bound to helicases in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to gain insight into the structural chemistry of enzyme inhibition and inform future efforts in helicase drug design. We first review the classification and structural biology of helicases. Subsequently, we analyze crystal structures to delineate common and distinct features in the modes of action of small molecule inhibitors in complex with human RECQL5, BLM, WRN, SMARCA2, eIF4A1, and BRR2, SARS-CoV-2 NSP13, hepatitis C virus NS3, Zika virus NS3, coxsackievirus B3 2C, and JC polyomavirus large T antigen (LTag) helicases. By examining the conformational dynamics of these enzymes during various stages of the reaction cycle, we provide insights into the mechanisms of inhibition. Helicase Classification and Structure Helicases are classified based on several key features, including substrate specificity, translocation polarity, and oligomeric architecture. 1 Three predominant helicase superfamilies (SF) were originally defined based on conserved amino acid motifs 4 ( Figure 1 ). The two largest superfamilies, SF1 and SF2, share seven well-conserved motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, VI), including the Walker A (motif I; phosphate-binding loop) and Walker B (motif II; Mg 2+ -binding) motifs, crucial for NTP binding and hydrolysis. 6 The SF3 family has three conserved motifs, that also include the Walker A and Walker B. 22 Figure 1 Helicase core domain and conserved motifs of superfamily 1 and 2 helicases. (A) Crystal structure of the bacterial helicase PcrA (PDB 3PJR ) bound to ATP (orange) and DNA (gray). The top right diagram is a schematic representation of the motifs in PcrA that are typical of SF1 helicases. The labels within the boxes are the names and sequences of the assigned motifs (motifs Q, I–Ic, and II–VI). Where information is available, the motifs of PcrA were referenced from various sources. 6 , 24 , 25 The motifs are positioned at a cleft formed at the interface of the N- and C-terminal RecA-like core helicase domains (purple and blue, respectively). (B) Crystal structure and conserved motifs of the SF2 RNA helicase Vasa (PDB 2DB3 ). The helicase motifs of Vasa were found from various sources. 6 , 26 Accessory (noncore) domains of both helicases are shown in light gray. All of the figures were generated with ICM Molsoft. The discovery of various helicases in viruses, bacteria, archaebacteria, and plants with novel sequence motifs prompted a revision of the classification into six superfamilies ( Figure 2 ). 23 Under the new classification system, SF1 and SF2 groups expanded to include four new motifs (ex. TxGx, Q-motif, motif IVa, and TRG; note that not all motifs are present in each family within the SFs; Figure 1 ), and DnaB-like, Rho, and AAA+ ATPase helicases defined new superfamilies SF4, SF5, and SF6, respectively. 1 , 23 Despite having distinct motifs, helicases across these superfamilies share structural and mechanistic characteristics, including a core (RecA-like or AAA+) domain that couples ATP hydrolysis with the separation of nucleotide duplexes. These domains feature specific structural motifs responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, such as the Walker A and B motifs as well as motif VI that contains a conserved arginine finger (in SF1 and SF2) pivotal in coupling NTP hydrolysis with strand separation. Other functions may require additional domains or structural elements. 23 Figure 2 Structural core and oligomeric state of helicase superfamilies. (A) Crystal structure of the SF1 bacterial helicase PcrA (PDB 3PJR ) bound to ATP and DNA. (B) Crystal structure of the SF2 RNA helicase Vasa (PDB 2DB3 ) bound to RNA and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. (C–F) SF3–SF4 helicases form toroidal or hexameric structures. The hexameric and monomeric structures of SF3, 4, 5, and 6 helicases (bovine papilloma virus E1 (BPV E1), PDB 2GXA ; bacteriophage T7 gp4, 6N7S ; E. coli Rho transcription termination factor, 3ICE ; RuvB DNA helicase, 1IN4 ) are presented side by side. There are no hexameric crystal structures for the RuvB SF6 helicase (PDB 1IN4 ) therefore, only the monomer is shown. RecA-like core helicase domains are in bright colors and accessory/insertion domains are light gray. ATP and analogues: orange. RNA/DNA: dark gray. Structural studies of SF1 and SF2 helicases have identified that the RecA-like helicase core consists of two domains connected by a linker region, referred to as the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domain. 23 Most helicases in these SFs function as monomers, dimers, or higher order oligomers. 12 In SF1 and SF2 helicases, both helicase domains are homologous to each other, with motifs III and Va playing key roles in coordinating ATP hydrolysis to nucleic acid binding and unwinding. While, highly conserved within each superfamily, differences in sequence identity between SF1 and SF2 suggest distinct communication mechanisms between the two. The motifs that contact the nucleic acid (motifs Ia, b, c, IV, IVa, V, and Vb) are similarly arranged in both SFs ( Figure 1 ) but are not conserved across families. 6 These structural differences influence how each superfamily and family interact with specific substrates and perform specialized unwinding tasks. 6 , 23 The hexameric helicases (SF3–SF6) form ring shaped structures, typically homohexameric, and are involved in DNA replication in both initiation and elongation phases. 27 SF3 helicases are found in small DNA and RNA viruses and perform multiple enzymatic activities, such as origin recognition and remodelling of proteins, while also functioning as replicative helicases. 28 These helicases contain a AAA+ helicase core with four conserved motifs (A, B, B′, and C), where motif A and B correspond to motifs I and II in SF1 and SF2. 23 SF4 helicases are found in bacterial and phage replicative helicases, which unzip duplex nucleic acids. They contain a RecA-like helicase domain with five characteristic motifs, H1, H1a, H2, H3, and H4, with H1 and H2 corresponding to motifs I and II in SF1 and SF2. 23 SF5 helicase family only contains the Rho helicase, a bacterial transcription termination factor that assists in RNA polymerase recycling and the control of gene expression. 29 SF6 helicases consist of AAA+ helicases that are distinct from members of SF3. 23 These helicases are mainly Mini Chromosome Maintenance (MCM) proteins, which drive the progression of eukaryotic and archaeal replication forks and participate in various aspects of DNA metabolism. 29 , 30 Helicase Mechanism of Action The unwinding mechanism of helicases across all superfamilies can be broken down into two steps: (a) unidirectional translocation along single-stranded nucleic acid and (b) strand-separation. 1 The energy necessary to carry out these functions is provided by NTP hydrolysis. 1 The associated conformational remodelling relies on complex contributions of various motifs within the RecA-like helicase domain, 31 which is the focus of the next section, as interference with these transition states is a recurrent structural mechanism of chemical inhibition. Detailed studies of SF1 and SF2 helicases have provided insight into a common structural mechanism ( Figure 3 ). 23 The helicase reaction cycle begins with the initial binding of helicase to nucleic acids in an open conformation. ATP binding induces a transition into a closed state by narrowing the cleft between the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains, which facilitates the unwinding of the nucleic acid duplex and positions ATP for hydrolysis. ADP is then released, and the helicase reverts to an open state. 23 , 32 While this cycle is common in SF1 and SF2 helicases, there are variations in how these families interact with ATP and nucleic acids, reflecting their various roles. Figure 3 MOA of SF1 and SF2 helicases. The first stage of the catalytic cycle begins with the open state, where the binding of ATP (purple) and nucleic acid (black) prompts the closure of the RecA-like helicase domains (blue and orange). Following ATP hydrolysis, the cleft between the helicase domains reopens, preparing the complex for another cycle of ATP binding. All schematic diagrams were created using BioRender. Helicase Inhibitors and Inhibition Mechanisms In recent years, several publications have reported drug-like compounds or fragments targeting helicases. We systematically compiled a list of ligands bound to helicases in the PDB sourced from the ChemBioPort database. 33 These compounds can be grouped into four types based on their mechanisms of small molecule inhibition ( Table 1 ): Type 1 (allosteric inhibitors), Type 2 (RNA competitors), Type 3 (interfacial inhibitors), and Type 4 (ATP-competitive inhibitors). Table 1 Known Small Molecule Inhibitors, Their Target Helicases, And the Corresponding Types of Inhibition a a The types of inhibition are categorized as follows: Type 1 (allosteric inhibitors), Type 2 (RNA competitors), Type 3 (interfacial inhibitors), and Type 4 (ATP-competitive inhibitors). Type 1 Inhibition: Allosteric Inhibition Type 1 inhibitors lock helicases in a specific conformational state, thereby preventing the structurally dynamic unwinding process ( Figure 4 A), or stabilize an inactive form of the enzyme ( Figure 5 A). Helicases bound to inhibitors falling under the first category are RECQL5 (PDB 5LBA ( 34 )), BLM (PDB 7AUD ( 35 )), and WRN (PDB 7GQU ( 36 )), and enteroviral helicase 2C ( Figure 4 ). The second type of inhibitors are found in complex with SMARCA2 (PDB 6EG3 ( 38 ) and 6EG2 ( 38 )) and WRN (PDB 8PFO ( 19 )) ( Figure 5 ). Figure 4 Some allosteric inhibitors freeze the enzymatic cycle. (A) Schematic representation of the first category of Type 1 inhibition, where an inhibitor (purple) locks the helicase into its open or closed state, disrupting the enzymatic cycle. (B) Fragment (purple) binds at the interface of the N- and C-terminal RecA-like domains and locks RECQL5 in an open state (PDB 5LBA ). 34 DNA is extracted from a superimposed structure (PDB 2WWY ( 45 )) and shown only as a reference. (C) Compound 2 (purple) binds at the interface of the N- and C-terminal RecA-like domains and locks BLM in an open, pre-ATP hydrolysis state (PDB 7AUD ). 35 (D) Covalent inhibitor VVD-133214 binds at the interface of the N- and C-terminal RecA-like domains and locks WRN in a closed state (PDB 7GQU ). 36 DNA and accessory domains (gray) are from a superimposed structure of BLM (PDB 4CGZ ( 46 )) and shown only as a reference. (E) ( S )-fluoxetine (SFX; purple; PDB 6T3W ( 37 )) binds at a pocket distal to the ATP-binding pocket in the coxsackievirus SF3 helicase 2C, to lock the hexameric helicase in a closed state and prevent the conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis. The hexameric model is derived from the helicase of simian virus 40 (SV40; PDB 1SVM ( 47 )), showing the SF3 helicase domain in turquoise, and accessory domains depicted in gray. Inset: monomer of coxsackievirus B3 helicase 2C bound to SFX (purple) (PDB 6T3W ), with an ATP mimetic (red) from superimposed enterovirus 71 helicase 2C (PDB 5GRB ( 48 )). Figures were created with ICM (Molsoft). Figure 5 Inactivating allosteric inhibitors. (A) Schematic mechanism of action of inactivating allosteric inhibitors. The inhibitor (turquoise) targets an allosteric pocket within the helicase domain (blue and orange) and may bind at various stages of the ATP-dependent catalytic cycle. Binding stabilizes the helicase in an inactive state. (B) Type 1 inhibitors targeting SMARCA2 are depicted, with compounds 15 (turquoise; PDB 6EG3 ( 38 )) and 16 (light green; PDB 6EG2 ( 38 )) bound to SMARCA2. ADP and DNA are absent from the structure and shown here as reference, from a superimposed structure of SMARCA4 (PDB 7VDT ( 63 )). The close-up view shows how the compounds directly engage and trap the catalytic glutamate E852 in an inactive “out” conformation as compared with the rotameric state observed in the SMARCA4 structure (magenta). The flexible ARL loop is highlighted in green. Compounds 15 and 16 revealed the structural mechanism of this chemical series and compound 14 (IC 50 < 5 nM) was selected for in vivo studies due to its superior potency. (C) Allosteric inhibitor HRO761 (turquoise; PDB 8PFO ( 19 )) stabilizes an inactive state of WRN where it induces a 180° rotation of the C-terminal RecA-like helicase domain (orange) relative to the ATP-bound state (PDB 7GQS ( 36 )). All ribbon representations were made by using ICM Molsoft. RECQL5 RECQL5 (RECQ5) is a DNA-dependent SF2 helicase that belongs to the RecQ subfamily. 49 This class of enzymes is evolutionarily conserved across species, from bacteria to humans, to maintain genomic integrity by regulating telomeres, DNA repair, recombination, and replication. 50 The loss or dysfunction of these helicases can lead to genomic instability, chromosomal breakage, and elevated risk of cancer and premature aging. 50 , 51 In humans, five RecQ helicases have been identified: RECQL5, Bloom’s syndrome helicase (BLM), Werner syndrome helicase (WRN), RECQ4, and RECQ1. 52 RECQL5 performs several biological functions, including inhibiting RNA polymerase II transcription elongation, acting as a tumor suppressor, and preventing collisions between the transcription and replication machineries. 53 , 54 Additionally, RECQL5 participates in DNA repair pathways, particularly in double-strand break repair, while it also serves as a backup in cells deficient in WRN and BLM. 53 , 55 RECQL5 promotes genomic stability through two main mechanisms: interacting with RNA polymerase IIa via its KIX domain and dsDNA unwinding activity. These processes are required for the enzyme’s recruitment and stable association at DNA double strand break sites, thereby facilitating efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic integrity. 55 While mutations in RECQL5 have not been directly implicated in human disorders, loss of RECQL5 impacts both DNA replication and transcription, leading to an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities and a higher incidence of tumors. This effect could potentially increase cancer susceptibility in tissues with high replication rates, such as skin, gut, bone marrow, and hematopoietic tissue. 55 RECQL5 is believed to adopt an “inchworm” type enzymatic cycle, but the detailed sequence of structural transitions remains unclear. 49 Unlike other SF2 helicases, RECQL5 adopts a closed conformation in its apo state. Initially, the C-terminal RecA-like helicase domain contacts DNA via motif VI and an aromatic rich loop (ARL) that stabilizes RECQL5 in a low-affinity state. ATP-binding then triggers a rearrangement of motif I, creating steric clashes that disrupt these contacts and separate the RecA-like helicase domains, transforming RECQL5 to a high-affinity state required for ATP hydrolysis. Posthydrolysis, the helicase domains open further, facilitating a single nucleotide step along the DNA, followed by phosphate release, which returns RECQL5 to its low-affinity state. Finally, the release of ADP permits the interactions between acidic residues in motif II, and the basic residues in motif IV bring the helicase domains closer together to form the closed state. 49 This RECQL5 mechanism can be used as a model for the broader RecQ helicase family. The structural mechanism of RECQL5 can be exploited by compounds inhibiting the enzyme’s conformational transition from a closed to an open state ( Figure 4 A). Recent enzymatic assays have uncovered a fragment occupying an allosteric pocket present in the open conformational state of RECQL5 and located at the interface of the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains ( Figure 4 B). 34 Given the similarities in the domain architecture of RECQL1 and RECQL5, the allosteric pocket identified in RECQL5 may be found in RECQL1 and potentially more broadly within the RecQ family. Selectivity in small molecule targeting of helicases, particularly within the RecQ family, remains challenging due to the relatively high degree of sequence identity among family members. However, specific features of RECQL5 could potentially be explored to develop selective inhibitors. These include a C-terminal “wedge” helix, unique to RECQL5 and essential for its helicase activity, as well as a cluster of positively charged residues (R441, R442, R443 and R449) and an aromatic residue (W453) positioned in a solvent-exposed region, which might serve as a target for small molecule inhibitors. 49 However, these ideas are hypothetical and would require experimental validation to determine their feasibility as targeting strategies. Additionally, exploiting conformational states or transitions unique to a specific helicase can enhance the selectivity. Within the RecQ family, the aromatic-rich loop undergoes conformational changes during the catalytic cycle that could be leveraged for selective inhibition. 35 While the ARL is a conserved feature across many RecQ helicases, there are notable variations in its presence and context, particularly in RECQL4 and -5. 56 Auxiliary domains also offer an opportunity for selective targeting such as the helicase and RNase D C-terminal (HRDC) domain, which is found only in BLM and WRN in humans. 7 , 46 BLM BLM, like RECQL5, belongs to the RecQ family of helicases that play a key role in regulating genomic processes. Mutations in BLM are associated with Bloom syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by genomic instability, growth deficiency, and shortened life expectancy. 57 , 58 Although BLM shares high sequence and structural similarities with other RecQ helicases, its unique substrate specificity and catalytic properties translate into unique biological functions. 7 The primary biological role of BLM is to maintain chromosomal stability by preventing chromosomal aberrations and rearrangements. It is involved in DNA repair via a homologous recombination (HR) mechanism. 56 , 57 BLM ensures efficient repair while preventing excessive or inappropriate recombination events, thereby maintaining genomic integrity. 56 In cells lacking functional BLM, such as in individuals with Bloom syndrome, a marked increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges contributes to chromosomal instability. This instability underlines many of the clinical features of Bloom syndrome, including cancer predisposition and other genetic abnormalities. 57 A Type 1 inhibitor occupies a site at the interface of the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains of BLM, thereby interfering with conformational changes needed for the catalytic cycle ( Figure 4 C). This noncompetitive inhibitor does not inhibit ATP or DNA binding but prevents the unwinding of DNA with an IC 50 of 1.8 μM. 35 The formation of the allosteric pocket requires a specific conformation of the ARL to be accessible that is only found when the N-terminal RecA-like helicase domain interacts with ssDNA. Despite high sequence conservation in motifs I and III, selectivity of the allosteric inhibitor arises from interactions in distinct structural elements like the “Helical Hairpin” near motif IV. 35 WRN WRN is another member of the RecQ family involved in the repair of specific types of DNA damage, including double-strand breaks and base excision repair. 56 Like other RecQ helicases, WRN is important for maintaining genomic stability, with both its helicase and exonuclease activities contributing to the resolution of complex DNA structures that arise during replication and repair processes. 7 , 56 Mutations in the WRN gene cause Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature aging, increased cancer risk, increased chromosomal aberrations, and heightened sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. 7 , 59 WRN is unique among the other RecQ helicases as it has both helicase and exonuclease activities. 59 VVD-133214, an allosteric inhibitor of WRN, covalently engages cysteine C727 to block the enzymatic cycle ( Figure 4 D). VVD-133214 inhibits helicase activity with an IC 50 ranging from 0.14 to 7.65 μM across different WRN constructs (ATPase domain, helicase core, helicase core with HRDC domain, and full length WRN) in both the presence and absence of ADP 36 and was selective over BLM. Formation of a covalent adduct was necessary for potent inhibition. Structural analysis of WRN in complex with ADP, ATP, and VVD-133214, demonstrated that the inhibitor binds an allosteric pocket in the closed conformation at the interface of the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains, effectively stopping the helicase enzymatic cycle. The inhibitor does not impair DNA binding but targets the pre-DNA-bound state, with decreased activity when WRN is actively unwinding DNA. Interestingly, the ligand also shows cooperative binding with the nucleotide. The activity observed both in ATPase and cell-based assays has made this compound a promising preclinical candidate for the treatment of cancers with microsatellite instability. 36 Enterovirus 2C Helicase Enteroviruses (EVs) are responsible for poliomyelitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and other life-threatening infections. 60 While immunization has nearly eradicated poliovirus, non-polio EVs continue to cause mortality around the world. 61 This situation underscores the urgent clinical need for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals to treat EV-associated diseases. 37 Nonstructural protein 2C is a central target for enteroviral drug discovery, as it plays an essential role in several steps of the EV life cycle, such as viral RNA replication, chaperoning, and helicase activities. 62 The 2C protein is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that is highly conserved in EVs. It is predicted to be a hexameric SF3 helicase based on its AAA+ ATPase domain and conserved SF3 motifs. SFX, the S -enantiomer of fluoxetine (Prozac), a marketed serotonin reuptake inhibitor for major depression and anxiety disorder, is a 2C inhibitor with antiviral effect against a variety of EV serotypes. 60 The compound binds an allosteric site in the coxsackievirus B3 2C protein ( Figure 4 E; PDB 6T3W ), exhibiting an ATPase EC 50 of ∼5 μM and a dissociation equilibrium constant ( K d ) of 9.5 μM by isothermal calorimetry. 37 The binding site is a highly conserved hydrophobic pocket formed by two flexible loops near the ATP-binding site. SFX interacts with the pocket primarily through hydrophobic interactions involving residues L157, P159, M175, D176, L178, C179, P182, and D186, with stabilization from hydrogen bonding. The binding of SFX causes structural changes, including a 10° tilt of the α2 helix and repositioning of the Walker B carrying loop, which enlarges the binding site. While SFX opens this local pocket for binding, it then stabilizes an overall closed conformation of the 2C helicase, locking it in a defined hexameric state that inhibits its ATPase activity. By preventing conformational transitions, SFX and similar compounds like dibucaine interfere with 2C’s function in viral replication. Inhibiting 2C through this highly conserved site provides a potential foundation for the structure-based design of potent, broad-spectrum antivirals against enteroviruses. 37 Additionally, the mutational constraints suggest that targeting this site could lead to the development of antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. 37 Another class of Type I inhibitors allosterically lock helicases in neither their open or closed conformation but in an inactive state, as illustrated by SMARCA2 and WRN targeting compounds ( Figure 5 ). SMARCA2 The SWitch/Sucrose Nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) helicase, SMARCA2, is a key enzymatic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex. 64 SMARCA2 regulates the accessibility of chromatin to the transcriptional machinery. It is also involved in DNA damage repair pathways, particularly in homologous recombination, where SMARCA2 relocates to DNA lesions and recruits proteins involved in DNA repair. 65 Mutations in SMARCA2 can lead to Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, a disorder caused by heterozygous missense mutations that primarily affect the ATPase domain. This syndrome is characterized by sparse hair, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. 66 Additionally, SMARCA2 is a synthetic lethality target in cancers with inactivated SMARCA4. 64 Compounds 15 and 16 occupy an allosteric pocket within the N-terminal RecA-like helicase domain of SMARCA2 ( Figure 5 B). 38 Compound 15 (PDB 6EG3 ) traps a catalytic glutamate (Glu852) from motif II in an out-conformation via a bidentate interaction with its urea linker. This inactive conformation may prevent ATP binding. Compound 16 (PDB 6EG2 ) engages Glu852 in a similar conformation. The pocket can accommodate ligands with diverse geometries, thanks to a highly flexible ARL loop (Glu852–His860). Compounds 15 and 16 revealed the structural mechanism of the chemical series but had no reported activity. Compound 14 , a chemical analogue that advanced to in vivo studies (IC 50 of <5 nM), is expected to share the same mechanism of action. 38 WRN HRO761 is a Type 1 inhibitor that locks the WRN in an inactive state 19 ( Figure 5 C). It binds selectively to a nonconserved allosteric site between the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains. This interaction stabilizes an atypical conformation in which the C-terminal RecA-like domain is rotated by 180° relative to the ATP-bound state. This dramatic remodelling is enabled by a flexible hinge (residues 728–732) connecting the two RecA-like domains that splits the ATP-binding site in two and inhibits the ATPase activity with an IC 50 of 100 nM. Despite these changes, the DNA-binding sites on the D1 and D2 domains remain unobstructed, indicating that HRO761 is uncompetitive with DNA. 19 Finally, a Type I inhibitor targeting the HCV NS3 protein binds at the interface of the protease and helicase domains, thereby inhibiting the protease activity, while its effect on the helicase function is unclear (PDB 4B73 ). 67 Type 2 Inhibition: RNA Competitors Another mechanism of helicase inhibition experimentally characterized is direct RNA competition, as illustrated by the two structures in the PDB ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6 Type 2 inhibitors. (A) Schematic depicting the MOA of RNA competitors (magenta). (B) Compound 12 (magenta; PDB 5URM ( 39 )) binds to the helicase Brr2. The inhibitor occupies the RNA binding site lined by both the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains (blue and orange, respectively). A DNA molecule from the superimposed structure of a non-human helicase homologue from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (PDB 2P6R ( 68 )) and ATP from another Brr2 structure (PDB 4KIT ( 69 )) are shown. (C) Mesh representation of HCV NS3 helicase in complex with compound 19 (magenta; PDB 4OKS ( 40 )), RNA (black; from PDB 3KQL ( 70 )), and ADP (pink; from PDB 3KQL ). Compound 19 competes with RNA at the binding site between the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains (blue and orange, respectively). Structures are also available in complex with chemically analogous compounds A and B (PDB 3RVB , 4WXR ). The figures were produced by using ICM Molsoft. Brr2 The RNA helicase Brr2 is a Ski2-like helicase that plays a critical role in pre-mRNA splicing, specifically in the activation, catalysis, and disassembly of the spliceosome. 71 It is involved in remodeling activities during spliceosome activation, where it unwinds the U4/U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) complex, allowing U6 to participate in the formation of the catalytic active site. The multifunctional abilities of Brr2 are important to the spliceosome pathway, as it not only activates the spliceosome but also maintains its integrity and may be involved in later stages of splicing and spliceosome disassembly. Unlike other spliceosomal helicases, Brr2 remains associated with the spliceosome throughout the entire splicing process, suggesting that it has multiple roles and requires tight regulation of its activity. 71 Mutations in Brr2, specifically within its RNA binding channel, are linked to a form of degenerative blindness known as retinitis pigmentosa. 72 , 73 Compound 12 specifically binds the RNA site within the N-terminal helicase cassette ( Figure 6 B). 39 The RNA binding site is formed by the RecA-like helicase domains and HB/HLH domains, creating a large open-ended channel. The inhibitor is not specific and has an IC 50 of 5.3 μM, 57 μM, 32 μM, and 58 μM for helicases Brr2, eIF4A1, eIF4A3, and DHX29, respectively. 39 The lack of selectivity may arise from the shared structural features among RNA-binding domains across different proteins, leading to cross reactivity. Another challenge associated with DNA and RNA binding sites is their electropositive nature, which typically requires charged ligands that may not cross cell membranes. These challenges highlight the difficulty in achieving high selectivity and cellular potency while targeting the RNA binding site. Hepatitis C Virus Nonstructural Protein 3 (HCV NS3) RNA Competitors Compound 19 specifically binds to the RNA binding site within the N-terminal RecA-like helicase domain of HCV NS3 helicase (PDB 4OKS ) 40 ( Figure 6 C). The study indicates potential pH-dependent interactions between the RNA competitor and NS3. The binding pocket is attractive for drug development due to it is conservation across 361 HCV genome sequences, indicating potential for pan-genotype activity and a strategic approach to mitigate resistance. 40 However, given the pocket’s wide, groovelike structure and considerable protein flexibility, helicase unwinding assays are needed to assess the compound’s binding affinity in both free and bound states. Additionally, structural and biophysical studies with the full-length HCV protein may be required to more accurately determine ligand efficacy. 40 Type 3 Inhibition: Interfacial Inhibitors This MOA is exemplified by inhibitors of the helicase eIF4A1 that bind to the protein–RNA interfaces, thereby stabilizing the complex and slowing the enzymatic cycle ( Figure 7 A). 43 , 74 This category includes two distinct natural products, desmethyl pateamine A (DMPatA; PDB 6XKI ( 43 )) and rocaglate (RocA; PDB 5ZC9 ( 41 )) analogues, which inhibit translation initiation by anchoring eIF4A1 onto RNA. 41 , 43 Interestingly the two compounds function by a common molecular mechanism despite being chemically unrelated 43 ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7 Interfacial inhibitors. (A) Schematic representation of the MOA of interfacial inhibitors (purple) that bind at the RNA–helicase interface in the presence of both ADP and RNA, blocking RNA unwinding and inhibiting helicase activity. (B) Desmethyl pateamine A (DMPatA; purple) inhibits the helicase eIF4A1 with high selectivity and an IC 50 of 1 nM in translation assays. 43 A mesh representation and close-up view show the inhibitor binding at the interface between RNA and the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains (PDB 6XKI ( 43 )). (C) Rocaglamide A (RocA; purple) binds similarly at the interface of RNA and eIF4A1 (PDB 5ZC9 ( 41 )), demonstrating a very similar MOA. (D) Silvestrol (PDB 9AVR ; 42 purple), another rocaglate, also targets the same interface as RocA, employing a similar MOA. Structure images were generated with ICM (Molsoft). The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) is an ATP-dependent SF2 helicase involved in translation initiation. 75 It functions as a RNA chaperone and mediates RNA–protein association and dissociation. 75 eIF4A1 is involved in mRNA translation by unwinding secondary structures in mRNA, thereby facilitating ribosome binding. Since eIF4A1 is important in regulating mRNA translation, it influences cellular expression and function. Mutations and abnormal expression of this helicase are associated with a variety of cancers, including gastric, breast, melanoma, and colorectal. 75 Overexpression of eIF4A1 is correlated with advanced tumor metastasis, poor tumor differentiation, and poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. In leukemia and other cancers, eIF4A helicases have also been linked to resistance against chemotherapy. 75 DMPatA specifically inhibits translation initiation by preventing RNA release from eIF4A1 and interfering with ribosome recruitment or scanning on mRNA, with an IC 50 of ∼1 nM. 43 The crystal structure reveals that DMPatA binds to the eIF4A1–AMPPNP–RNA complex by stabilizing a closed conformation that facilitates ATP binding and hydrolysis 43 ( Figure 7 B). Rocaglamide A (RocA) works similarly as a selective translation inhibitor by binding specifically to certain RNA sequences, particularly consecutive purine residues that create a cavity accommodating the compound 41 ( Figure 7 C). The complex remains stable even after ATP hydrolysis, leading to prolonged translation inhibition. 41 The rocaglate compound class demonstrates antitumor activity through the mechanism of clamping eIF4A1 to RNA stretches and stabilizing it in a closed state that occurs upon binding to both RNA and ATP. Unlike RocA, silvestrol ( Figure 7 D) inhibits translation of mRNAs containing both purine stretches and polypyrimidines in the 5′ UTR. 42 This broader spectrum of activity is attributed to silvestrol’s unique dioxanyloxy group, as revealed by the crystal structure of the eIF4A1·AMPPNP·poly(AG)5 RNA–silvestrol complex. Silvestrol’s mechanism of action involves inhibiting both 43S PIC recruitment and ribosome scanning, with stronger effects when bound near the mRNA cap. The IC 50 values for translation inhibition of various mRNAs were found to range from 0.06 to 2.3 μM. Silvestrol has shown anticancer effects in various xenograft models, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast and prostate cancer. However, silvestrol has pharmacokinetic limitations, including rapid conversion to inactive silvestric acid and sensitivity to P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux. The structural insights from this study could inform future structure–activity relationship studies to improve silvestrol’s pharmacokinetic properties or develop new rocaglates with broader RNA selectivity, such as the recently reported MG-002, potentially expanding the therapeutic applications of this compound class. 42 These interfacial inhibitors face a few challenges that can limit their efficacy. One concern is the conservation of residues critical for DMPatA binding within the eIF4A family, which can result in off-target effects, including the complete deactivation of nonsense-mediated decay. 43 Additionally, mutations in amino acids such as F163 can induce resistance to rocaglates and DMPatA. 43 Type 4 Inhibition: ATP-Competitive Inhibitors Direct competition with ATP binding is a fourth inhibition mechanism, as exemplified by a dual inhibitor of human polyomaviruses JC (JCV) and BK (BKV; Figure 8 ). Figure 8 ATP competitors. (A) Schematic representation of the MOA of ATP competitive inhibitors (teal). (B) Compound 12h (teal; PDB 5J4Y ( 44 )) binds to the SF3 JCV helicase. The inhibitor occupies the ATP binding pocket formed between two JCV monomers (plum and pink). The ATP molecules from simian virus 40 helicase (PSB 1SVM 47 ) are shown. Structure images were generated with ICM (Molsoft). JCV and BKV are the two most clinically significant human polyomaviruses. 76 They are small, nonenveloped viruses with circular double-stranded DNA genomes. JCV is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. 44 , 77 BKV is associated with polyomavirus-associated nephropathy in kidney and hemorrhagic cystitis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. 77 Currently, there are no approved antiviral treatments that target these viruses making them a significant concern in immunocompromised patients. 78 These viruses also encode a large tumor antigen that contains a SF3 hexameric helicase domain necessary for viral DNA replication. 44 The antigen is a viral protein with no human counterpart and represents an attractive therapeutic target. 44 Developed through a fragment-based drug discovery approach, compound 12h , was found to be one of the most potent ATP-competitive inhibitors among the compounds crystallized ( Figure 8 B). 44 It binds primarily to one of the two JCV monomers that make up the ATP-binding pocket of the helicase. The binding of the compound is further stabilized by a π-stacking interaction between the phenoxy group of the compound and R555. 12h is a dual inhibitor of the JCV and BKV with IC 50 values of 1.6 μM against BKV and 0.9 μM against JCV helicase. The thiazolopyridine series, including 12h , showed measurable antiviral activity in Vero cells without marked cytotoxicity. Further optimization led to compound 12i , with an improved biochemical activity of 0.6 μM. The compounds showed no significant inhibition on a panel of 66 human kinases at 10 μM. The structure-based approach allowed for rapid improvement in potency, with key interactions including a hydrogen bond between the acetamide group of 12h and K420 of the second JCV monomer. However, further optimization was limited by the complexity of the ATP binding pocket and the mobility of key lysine residues (K419 and K420). Developing selective ATP-competitive inhibitors for helicases might face significant challenges due to the sequence conservation of this site. 79 , 80 Nevertheless, the measurable antiviral activity without marked cytotoxicity of these pioneering compounds suggests a possible way forward. Recent research indicates a growing interest and potential in directly inhibiting the ATP binding site of helicases for therapeutic purposes. Studies targeting WRN and MCM helicases have shown promising results, suggesting that despite the challenges associated with their dynamic nature and conserved binding sites, there may be a viable path forward for developing effective Type 4 inhibitors against helicases. 81 , 82 Helicase-Binding Fragments Now that we have reviewed the four inhibitory mechanisms established with drug-like molecules bound to helicases in the PDB, we will briefly review crystallized fragments identified through soaking experiments. Although these fragments lack defined inhibition activity, some occupy previously identified binding sites and confirm interaction hotspots, while others target novel allosteric pockets and may serve as chemical starting points for future medicinal chemistry efforts. SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 13 (NSP13) Crystallographic fragment screening against SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 identified a variety of fragments occupying distinct sites of potential interest for drug discovery. 83 Among RecA-like domain targeting fragments, three occupy cavities at the 5′ end, one at the central cavity, and three at the 3′ end of the RNA channel, between the C-terminal RecA-like helicase and the stalk domains (PDB 5RLH , 5RLZ , 5RMM , 5RML , 5RMC , 5RL8 , and 5RLK ) ( Figure 9 ). Fragments from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA binding cleft overlap or are in close proximity, making them candidates for merging as a strategy to improve affinity ( Figure 9 A). The RNA binding site of NSP13 is the most conserved drug binding site in coronaviruses, 84 and some of these fragments may represent valid chemical starting points for the discovery of pan-coronavirus antivirals, though, as mentioned above, targeting RNA/DNA binding sites is a challenging path in drug discovery. Multiple Type 4 fragments were also captured at the nucleotide binding pocket, confirming this site as an interaction hotspot of interest, even though it is less conserved than the RNA binding channel. However, as mentioned previously, there are very few examples of Type 4 inhibitors with high affinity. It is worth noting that these fragments were identified through X-ray crystallographic fragment screening of NSP13, so the occupancies of many fragments are low, and they may represent only millimolar affinity ligands. Nonetheless they can still be used to inspire the design of chemical structures and identify ligandable pockets. Figure 9 Fragments bound to SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase. (A) Ribbon representation of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase, highlighting the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains in blue and orange, respectively. The colored circles indicate fragment clusters: red, pink, and yellow circles denote fragments at the 5′ end (PDB 5RLH , 5RLZ , 5RMM ), the center ( 5RML ), and 3′ end (PDB 5RMC , 5RL8 , and 5RLK ) of the RNA binding site, while the green circle highlights fragments bound at the ATP binding site (PDB 5RLV , 5RM7 , 5RLN , 5RM2 , 5RLO , 5RL9 , 5RLJ , 5RLR , 5RLI , 5RLW , 5RLY , 7NNG , 5RL7 , and 5RLS ). The insets provide zoomed-in views of key fragments: the red inset highlights the fragments binding to the 5′ end of the RNA channel, illustrating its interaction with NSP13’s surface, and the yellow inset focuses on two fragments (PDB 5RLK and 5RL8 ) at the 3′ end, demonstrating their binding interactions within the helicase structure. (B) RNA (black) and ADP (pink) from a superimposed NSP13 structure (PDB 7RDY ) are shown as a reference. Hepatitis C Virus Nonstructural Protein 3 (HCV NS3) Three fragments are found bound to HCV NS3 in the PDB ( 5FPY , 5FPS , and 5FPT , which is similar to 4WXP ) 85 ( Figure 10 ). The ligand in 5FPS binds to the ATP binding site, whereas the fragments in 5FPY and 5FPT bind to two distinct areas of the nucleic acid binding region. The 5FPT fragment occupies the same pocket as the more advanced NS3 RNA competitors discussed above ( Figure 6 C). A parallel can be made between fragment binding patterns of NSP13 and NS3, found in both cases at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA site and at the nucleotide site, suggesting that common medicinal chemistry strategies may apply for these two viral helicases ( Figures 8 and 9 ). Figure 10 Fragments bound to HCV NS3 helicase. (A) Overview of the fragments bound to the helicase core domain of HCV NS3. (B) Fragments in dark purple (PDB 5FPY ) and light green (PDB 5FPT / 4WXP ) bind at the RNA binding site as illustrated with an RNA from another superimposed HCV NS3 structure (PDB 3KQL ). The third fragment (olive; PDB 5FPS ) overlaps with ATP (pink; PDB 3KQL ). As before, the N- and C-terminal RecA-like helicase domains are colored as blue and orange, respectively, with the accessory domains colored as gray. Zika Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) As they did for NSP13, von Delft and colleagues conducted a fragment screen by crystallography against the Zika virus NS3 helicase, yielding 46 bound fragments. 86 Ten of these interacted with the two RecA-like helicase domains at the ATP- and RNA-binding sites ( Figure 11 ). Nine exploited the same pocket at the interface of the N-terminal RecA domain and an accessory, noncore domain of the enzyme otherwise occupied by RNA (PDB 5RHG , 7G9M , 7GA1 , 7G9Y , 8UM3 , 7GA2 , 7G9T , 8V7R , and 8V7U ), while the fragment in PDB 7G9Q bound the ATP site. 86 Figure 11 Fragments bound to Zika virus NS3 helicase. (A) Overview of fragments bound to the Zika virus NS3 helicase. Nine fragments bind at the RNA site (PDB 5RHG , 7G9M , 7GA1 , 7G9Y , 8UM3 , 7GA2 , 7G9T , 8V7R , and 8V7U ) and one at the nucleotide pocket (PDB 7G9Q ). (B) Same view with ADP and RNA from superimposed structures (PDB 5K8U and 5MFX ). The fragment in PDB 8UM3 (white ligand in Figure 11 ) is unique as it covalently engages and induces a 180° twist of C262, a side chain that is highly conserved across the Flaviviridae family, including HCV, making it a valuable target for designing inhibitors. 86 Fragment screening approaches rely on libraries of hundreds of compounds with low molecular weight to identify low affinity but efficient binding molecules that can be optimized into more potent drug candidates. 87 Screening fragments allows for rapid exploration of the chemistry space, which is especially useful for the identification of potentially druggable binding pockets. Linking fragments occupying juxtaposed cavities can lead to a dramatic gain in potency but is a challenging exercise. Computational design of lead-like molecules derived from fragments can be driven by novel machine-learning models 88 and may provide a path for the exploitation of fragment screening data sets, for instance, from the Fragalysis platform, for viral helicases. Conclusion Helicases are a promising target class for drug discovery. Genetic aberrations lead to their pathogenic dysregulation in neurological diseases, 6 they are the second most essential protein family in cancer based on CRISPR knockout screens, 89 and they are essential for the replication of viruses with pandemic potential. Yet, the development of helicase inhibitors has proved challenging, and relatively few medicinal chemistry campaigns have succeeded on this target class. The complex kinetics associated with the coupling of two distinct enzymatic functions (nucleoside hydrolysis and DNA/RNA unwinding) is a challenge for the establishment of robust assay pipelines and may, in part, underlie the difficulty in developing robust structure–activity relationships for small molecule inhibition. Biophysical studies are especially challenging: while it has been possible to cocrystallize helicase inhibitors with the protein, there is a paucity of data reported in assays that measure direct binding or ligand-induced protein kinetics. Robust biochemical assays measuring ATPase and DNA/RNA unwinding can be used to measure enzyme activity; however, the complexity of the multiple steps of helicase action highlights the challenge of interpreting the static X-ray crystallography structures in the context of small molecule inhibition. Application of newly emerging biophysical techniques to study helicases as motor enzymes may offer a solution to this problem. For example, single molecule methods using optical and magnetic tweezers have been used to study the kinetics of the procession of helicases along DNA and the unwinding of nucleotide duplexes. 90 In addition, cryo-EM was successful in imaging the distinct conformational states of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase to enable MD simulations of its role in the viral replication complex. 91 Perhaps most promising is the potential use of time-resolved cryo-EM (trEM), which has been applied to other molecular machines involved in dynamic protein–nucleotide complexes. 92 If trEM imaging of the ensemble of conformation states resulting from small molecule inhibition of helicases can be achieved at a molecular level (as was recently achieved for the beta-adrenergic receptor 93 ), it has the potential to greatly aid drug design. Specifically, the dual function of helicases as ATPases and unwindases provides an opportunity for the development of ligands exploiting allosteric sites opening at either point of the enzymatic cycle. These pockets are transient and not conserved across helicases, which on one hand complicates the development of helicase libraries enriched in preferred chemotypes and hinders efforts to crystallographically characterize ligand binding modes and to rationally optimize chemical starting points, but it opens the road to the discovery of potent and selective ligands. Thus, helicases currently may be challenging targets for structure guided drug discovery, but the situation may change with the application of techniques that can account for their dynamic action as molecular motor enzymes.

  "plain_text": "Helicases are essential motor enzymes that couple nucleoside-triphosphate hydrolysis with DNA or RNA strand unwinding. Helicases are integral to replication, transcription, splicing, and translation of the genome, play crucial roles in the proliferation of cancer cells and propagation of viral pathogens, and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their therapeutic potential, drug discovery efforts targeting helicases face significant challenges due to their dynamic enzymatic cycles, the transient nature of their conformational states, and the conservation of their active sites. Analysis of cocrystal structures of inhibitor–helicase complexes revealed four distinct mechanisms of inhibition: allosteric, ATP-competitive, RNA-competitive, and interfacial inhibitors. While these static X-ray structures reveal potential binding pockets that may support the development of selective drugs, the application of advanced techniques such as cryo-EM, single-molecule analysis, and computational modeling will be essential for understanding helicase dynamics and designing effective inhibitors."
