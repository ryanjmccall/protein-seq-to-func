  "title": "NF-kappaB subunit p65 binds to 53BP2 and inhibits cell death induced by 53BP2.",

  "abstract_text": "Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of many cellular and viral genes. The p65 (RelA) subunit plays a critical role as a transcriptional activator and recent observations have highlighted its role in the control of apoptosis. Here we report that 53BP2, a protein previously identified by interaction with wild type p53 and Bcl-2, also binds to p65 in a yeast two-hybrid system. This specific interaction was confirmed by pull-down assay in vitro and by a mammalian two-hybrid assay in vivo. We observed that full-length 53BP2 fused to GFP had a punctate distribution in cytoplasm, predominantly in perinuclear region whereas the N-terminal 53BP2 localized in cytoplasm and C-terminal 53BP2 localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of GFP-53BP2 induced apoptosis in transiently transfected cells. Neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal of 53BP2 fused to GFP induced cell death. Interestingly, co-transfection with a p65 expression plasmid significantly inhibited 53BP2-induced cell death. The previous findings that 53BP2 bound to p53 and Bcl-2 together with our present observations suggest that 53BP2 may play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis and cell growth.",
