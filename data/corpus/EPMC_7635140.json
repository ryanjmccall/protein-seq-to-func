    "abstract_text": "Human aromatase cytochrome P450 catalyzes the ultimate reaction in the estrogen biosynthetic pathway by coupling with another enzyme, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, in the endoplasmic reticulum. The expression of the gene encoding the enzyme (CYP19) is regulated, in part, by tissue-specific promoters through the use of alternative-splicing mechanisms. Recently, we have localized a transcriptional activating element at positions -2141 to -2115 relative to the major cap site of the gene, by transient expression analyses in human BeWo choriocarcinoma cells using the bacterial chloramphenicol acetytransferase reporter gene ligated with CYP19 promoter sequences which regulate expression in this tissue. Here, we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding a DNA-binding protein which binds specifically to the regulatory element. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the insert is identical to that corresponding to the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain of a transcription factor, nuclear factor interleukin-6 (NF-IL6), a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family. Studies using specific antibodies against members of the C/EBP family demonstrate that NF-IL6 is the major nuclear factor binding to the regulatory element in BeWo cells; nevertheless. C/EBP alpha also seems to be involved. Disruption of the NF-IL6-binding site within the regulatory element resulted in the disappearance of the transcriptional enhancing activity of the element, indicating that NF-IL6 is at least one of the nuclear factor(s) which enhances transcription through binding to the cis-acting element. These results indicate the intrinsic importance of NF-IL6 in the transcriptional regulation of CYP19 expression.",
