  "abstract_text": "The serotonin transporter (SERT) has shown itself to be an effective pharmacological target in the treatment of mood disorders and some kinds of gastrointestinal syndromes. Most of the molecular studies of SERT in humans have been carried out using heterologous models. In this work, we have investigated the human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cell line as a potential \"in vitro\" model to study the human SERT. The results show that these cells express a SERT mRNA identical to the human brain SERT, and a 70 kDa protein immunodetected using a specific antibody. The SERT activity levels in Caco-2 cells increased in correlation with the onset and maintenance of the morphological and functional differentiation of the cells. Caco-2 SERT was also shown to be a high affinity (Kt=0.216 microM) saturable, Na(+) -dependent transporter that was inhibited by fluoxetine (IC(50)=17.6 nM). In addition, SERT activity was inhibited by the intracellular modulators protein kinase C and cAMP, either after short or long-term treatment. In short, the expression and molecular characteristics of the human SERT in Caco-2 cells indicate that this cell line may be an ideal tool to study in vitro the physiology and pharmacology of human SERT.",
