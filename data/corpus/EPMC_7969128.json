  "abstract_text": "Replication factor A (RF-A) is a heterotrimeric single-stranded-DNA-binding protein which is conserved in all eukaryotes. Since the availability of conditional mutants is an essential step to define functions and interactions of RF-A in vivo, we have produced and characterized mutations in the RFA1 gene, encoding the p70 subunit of the complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This analysis provides the first in vivo evidence that RF-A function is critical not only for DNA replication but also for efficient DNA repair and recombination. Moreover, genetic evidence indicate that p70 interacts both with the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex and with DNA polymerase delta.",
