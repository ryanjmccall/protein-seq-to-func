  "abstract_text": "Mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been reported in cases of type A insulin resistance. We report herein two cases of type A insulin resistance, which involve some novel mutations. Case 1 is a heterozygote of the C253Y missense mutation and case 2 is a heterozygote of the Y864X nonsense mutation. In the C253Y missense mutation in exon 3, a cysteine residue is replaced with tyrosine in the cysteine-rich domain of the alpha subunit. The Y864X in exon 13 results in a truncated receptor, which is devoid of most of the beta subunit. This mutant receptor could not be expressed on a cell membrane since the transmembrane domain is missing. Other significant mutations were not found for the entire coding regions and splice/donor sites.",
