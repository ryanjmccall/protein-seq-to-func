    "abstract_text": "To better understand the structural basis for the binding of proteinase-transformed human alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) to its receptor, we have used three-dimensional multinuclear NMR spectroscopy to determine the secondary structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of human alpha2M. Assignment of the backbone NMR resonances of RBD was made using 13C/15-N and 15N-enriched RBD expressed in Escherichia coli. The secondary structure of RBD was determined using 1H and 13C chemical shift indices and inter- and intrachain nuclear Overhauser enhancements. The secondary structure consists of eight strands in beta-conformation and one alpha-helix, which together comprise 44% of the protein. The beta-strands form three regions of antiparallel beta-sheet. The two lysines previously identified as being critical for receptor binding are located in (Lys1374), and immediately adjacent to (Lys1370) the alpha-helix, which also contains an (Arg1378). Secondary structure predictions of other alpha-macroglobulins show the conservation of this alpha-helix and suggest an important role for this helix and for basic residues within it for receptor binding.",
