    "abstract_text": "C99 is the transmembrane carboxyl-terminal domain of the amyloid precursor protein that is cleaved by \u03b3-secretase to release the amyloid-\u03b2 polypeptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy show that the extracellular amino terminus of C99 includes a surface-embedded \"N-helix\" followed by a short \"N-loop\" connecting to the transmembrane domain (TMD). The TMD is a flexibly curved \u03b1 helix, making it well suited for processive cleavage by \u03b3-secretase. Titration of C99 reveals a binding site for cholesterol, providing mechanistic insight into how cholesterol promotes amyloidogenesis. Membrane-buried GXXXG motifs (G, Gly; X, any amino acid), which have an established role in oligomerization, were also shown to play a key role in cholesterol binding. The structure and cholesterol binding properties of C99 may aid in the design of Alzheimer's therapeutics.",
