    "abstract_text": "We describe the fusion of TP53BP1 to PDGFRB in a patient with a chronic myeloid leukemia-like disorder associated with eosinophilia and a t(5;15)(q33;q22). TP53BP1 encodes 53BP1, a p53-binding protein that plays a role in cellular responses to DNA damage. The 53BP1-PDGFRbeta fusion protein is predicted to retain the kinetochore-binding domain of 53BP1 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of PDGFRbeta. The presence of the fusion was confirmed by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcription-PCR, and by characterizing the genomic breakpoints. The reciprocal fusion, which would contain the p53-binding 53BP1 BRCA1 COOH-terminal domains, was not detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization or nested PCR. Imatinib, a known inhibitor of PDGFRbeta, blocked the growth of patient colony-forming unit, granulocyte-macrophage in vitro and produced a clinically significant response before relapse and subsequent death with imatinib-resistant disease. We conclude that TP53BP1-PDGFRB is a novel imatinib target in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia.",
