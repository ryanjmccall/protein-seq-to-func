    "abstract_text": "Novel potent trisubstituted pyridazine inhibitors of p38 MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase are described that have activity in both cell-based assays of cytokine release and animal models of rheumatoid arthritis. They demonstrated potent inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in mice and exhibited good efficacy in the rat collagen induced arthritis model.",
