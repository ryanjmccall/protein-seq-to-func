    "abstract_text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induces the production of a number of cytokines and chemokines by activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The activation of NF-kappaB has been shown to depend on viral replication in the infected cells. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of RSV M2-1 protein, a transcriptional processivity and anti-termination factor, is sufficient to activate NF-kappaB in A549 cells. Electromobility shift assays show increased NF-kappaB complexes in the nuclei of M2-1-expressing cells. M2-1 protein is found in nuclei of M2-1-expressing cells and in RSV-infected cells. Co-immunoprecipitations of nuclear extracts of M2-1-expressing cells and of RSV-infected cells revealed an association of M2-1 with Rel A protein. Furthermore, the activation of NF-kappaB depends on the C-terminus of the RSV M2-1 protein, as shown by NF-kappaB-induced gene expression of a reporter gene construct.",
