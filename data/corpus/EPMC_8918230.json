    "abstract_text": "The myc proto-oncogene family plays an important role in the control of cellular growth and differentiation. Mxi1, one of the Max-associated proteins, has been known to have an antagonistic action on Myc activity. The mxi1 mRNA increased during growth inhibition and differentiation, and decreased with serum stimulation in mammal cell lines. We have also found an AAAAC polymorphic repeat in the 3' non-coding region of the human mxi1 cDNAs and a difference between the mxi1 mRNA half-lives in some different cell lines.",
