    "abstract_text": "Bacterially expressed fusion proteins containing the COOH-terminal domain of the human poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase were analyzed by means of a novel assay, the \"activity blot,\" which allows the detection of transferred polypeptides involved in poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the 40-kDa COOH-terminal region of the enzyme is an autonomous catalytic domain exhibiting both the polymerizing and branching activities in the absence of DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that lysine 893 is essential for these catalytic processes. In addition, sequence similarities obtained with the NAD(P)+ amino acid dehydrogenases suggest that (i) lysine 893 may interact with the substrates of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and (ii) the COOH-terminal part of the 40-kDa fragment may also contain a Rossman fold structure.",
