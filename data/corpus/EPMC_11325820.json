    "abstract_text": "The Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with immune deficiency, chromosome fragility, and increased susceptibility to lymphoid malignancies. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the potential role of the gene mutated in NBS (NBS1) in the pathogenesis and disease progression of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Samples from 47 children with first relapse of ALL were analyzed for mutations in all 16 exons of the NBS1 gene, and in 7 of them (14.9%), four novel amino acid substitutions were identified. Mutations S93L, D95N, and I171V occur in the two known domains of nibrin that are probably involved in protein-protein interactions. Germ-line origin of the I171V mutation was confirmed in three patients, whereas the D95N exchange was present only in leukemic cells. The R215W mutation was observed in one ALL but also in a population-based study and probably represents a rare sequence variant. No additional mutations were found on the second allele in any of these seven patients. The observed NBS1 gene mutations in ALL patients points to its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease.",
