  "abstract_text": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in regulating transcription by modifying the core histones of the nucleosome. To date, six HDACs have been identified in mammalian cells: the yeast RPD3 homologs HDAC1, 2, and 3 and the yeast HDA1 homologs HDAC4, 5, and 6. HDAC4 and HDAC5 contain a noncatalytic N-terminal domain. Herein, we report the identification of a protein HDRP (HDAC-related protein) that shares 50% identity in deduced amino acid sequence to the noncatalytic N-terminal domain of HDAC4 and 5. The steady-state levels of HDRP mRNA are high in human brain, heart, and skeletal muscle and low in the several other tissues. HDRP has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa. HDRP does not possess intrinsic HDAC activity but forms complexes with both HDAC1 and HDAC3. HDRP represses both basal and activated transcription in transient transfection assays when tethered to DNA as a Gal4-fusion protein. HDAC inhibitors do not reverse transcriptional repression mediated by Gal4-HDRP. Thus, HDRP is a transcriptional repressor and can repress transcription in the presence of HDAC inhibitors.",
