    "abstract_text": "1The traditional view of calcium homeostasis is that it is maintained by two essential reactions. First, changes in extracellular Ca2+ are sensed in several distinct cell types, stimulating the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25(OH)(2) D and calcitonin in response to the body's requirement. Second, these calcitropic hormones then act on the calcium-translocating cells of the kidney, bone, and intestine to restore calcium balance. Recent progress indicates that alpha-Klotho and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 are key players that integrate the multi-step regulatory system of calcium homeostasis that rapidly adjusts the extracellular calcium concentration and continuously maintains its concentration within a narrow physiological range. alpha-Klotho and FGF23 are also found to be major players in the regulatory system of phosphate homeostasis. Here, the demonstration of the molecular functions of alpha-Klotho and FGF23 has recently given new insight into the field of calcium and phosphate homeostasis.",
