  "abstract_text": "The transcriptional repressor BCL-6 regulates B lymphocyte cell fate during the germinal center reaction by preventing terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells until appropriate signals are received. Here, we report a cofactor, MTA3, a cell type-specific subunit of the corepressor complex Mi-2/NuRD, for BCL-6-dependent cell fate determination. MTA3 is expressed in the same pattern in germinal centers as BCL-6. BCL-6 physically interacts with Mi-2/NuRD and this interaction is sensitive to BCL-6 acetylation status. Depletion of MTA3 by RNAi impairs BCL-6-dependent repression and alters the cell-specific transcriptional pattern characteristic of the B lymphocyte. Remarkably, exogenous expression of BCL-6 in a plasma cell line leads, in an MTA3-dependent manner, to repression of plasma cell-specific transcripts, reactivation of the B cell transcriptional program, expression of B lymphocyte cell surface markers, and reprogramming of cell fate.",
