  "abstract_text": "IL-7 signaling culminates in different biological outcomes in distinct lymphoid populations, but knowledge of the biochemical signaling pathways in normal lymphoid populations is incomplete. We analyzed CD127/IL-7Ralpha expression and function in normal (nontransformed) human thymocytes, and human CD19(+) B-lineage cells purified from xenogeneic cord blood stem cell/MS-5 murine stromal cell cultures, to further clarify the role of IL-7 in human B cell development. IL-7 stimulation of CD34(+) immature thymocytes led to phosphorylation (p-) of STAT5, ERK1/2, AKT, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, and increased AKT enzymatic activity. In contrast, IL-7 stimulation of CD34(-) thymocytes (that included CD4(+)/CD8(+) double-positive, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) single-positive cells) only induced p-STAT5. IL-7 stimulation of CD19(+) cells led to robust induction of p-STAT5, but minimal induction of p-ERK1/2 and p-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta. However, CD19(+) cells expressed endogenous p-ERK1/2, and when rested for several hours following removal from MS-5 underwent de-phosphorylation of ERK1/2. IL-7 stimulation of rested CD19(+) cells resulted in robust induction of p-ERK1/2, but no induction of AKT enzymatic activity. The use of a specific JAK3 antagonist demonstrated that all IL-7 signaling pathways in CD34(+) thymocytes and CD19(+) B-lineage cells were JAK3-dependent. We conclude that human CD34(+) thymocytes and CD19(+) B-lineage cells exhibit similarities in activation of STAT5 and ERK1/2, but differences in activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The different induction of PI3K/AKT may at least partially explain the different requirements for IL-7 during human T and B cell development.",
