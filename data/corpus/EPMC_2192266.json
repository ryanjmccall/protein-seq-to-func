  "abstract_text": "The product of the CDC2Hs gene is the protein kinase subunit of the M-phase promoting factor, which is required for entry into mitosis. The activity of this kinase is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner by reversible phosphorylation and through association with other proteins. We report here that in HeLa cells, the abundance of the CDC2Hs mRNA and the rate of synthesis of the encoded protein, p34, vary in a cell cycle-dependent manner.",
