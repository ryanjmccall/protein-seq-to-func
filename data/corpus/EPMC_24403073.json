    "abstract_text": "mTORC1 plays critical roles in the regulation of protein synthesis, growth, and proliferation in response to nutrients, growth factors, and energy conditions. One of the substrates of mTORC1 is 4E-BP1, whose phosphorylation by mTORC1 reverses its inhibitory action on eIF4E, resulting in the promotion of protein synthesis. Raptor in mTOR complex 1 is believed to recruit 4E-BP1, facilitating phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by the kinase mTOR. We applied chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to gain insight into interactions between mTORC1 and 4E-BP1. Using the cross-linking reagent bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate, we showed that Raptor can be cross-linked with 4E-BP1. Mass spectrometric analysis of cross-linked Raptor-4E-BP1 led to the identification of several cross-linked peptide pairs. Compilation of these peptides revealed that the most N-terminal Raptor N-terminal conserved domain (in particular residues from 89 to 180) of Raptor is the major site of interaction with 4E-BP1. On 4E-BP1, we found that cross-links with Raptor were clustered in the central region (amino acid residues 56-72) we call RCR (Raptor cross-linking region). Intramolecular cross-links of Raptor suggest the presence of two structured regions of Raptor: one in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal region. In support of the idea that the Raptor N-terminal conserved domain and the 4E-BP1 central region are closely located, we found that peptides that encompass the RCR of 4E-BP1 inhibit cross-linking and interaction of 4E-BP1 with Raptor. Furthermore, mutations of residues in the RCR decrease the ability of 4E-BP1 to serve as a substrate for mTORC1 in vitro and in vivo.",
