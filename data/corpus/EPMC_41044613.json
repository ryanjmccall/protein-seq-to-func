Keywords Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma Post-translational modification Targeted therapy Social Science and Technology Research Major Project of Zhongshan 2021B3011 2021B3011 Zhong Linkun Wang Zhaohua issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Thyroid cancer, the most common primary endocrine malignancy, has increased globally over the past 40 years [ 1 ]. According to the latest report, thyroid cancer ranks third in combined incidence among men and women, and its incidence will rise over the next 20 years [ 2 ]. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) accounts for approximately 95% of all thyroid cancers, while medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and ATC comprise the remaining cases. Patients with DTC have a better prognosis, with a low mortality rate [ 3 ]. With the increase of iodine intake and the early diagnosis and treatment of DTC, the incidence of ATC gradually decreases [ 4 ]. However, ATC exhibits completely opposite biological characteristics, with a disease-specific mortality nearing 100% [ 5 ]. ATC is believed to develop from DTC through deleterious genetic events that drive anaplastic transformation [ 6 ]. The different clinical features between ATC and DTC are summarized in Table 1 through clinical studies in recent years [ 7 – 25 ]. Compared with DTC, patients with ATC are more likely to have recurrence, distant metastasis, poor prognosis, and heavy mutation burden. This difference necessitates varied subsequent treatment approaches and encourages further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of ATC, leading to the development of targeted drugs based on key molecules, mechanisms, or pathways. Table 1 The different clinical characteristics between DTC and ATC DTC ATC Sex (%) Female 84.7 ~ 88% 54 ~ 67% Male 12 ~ 15.3% 33 ~ 46% Age at diagnosis (years) 44.7 ~ 47.2 60 ~ 71.3 Tumor size (cm) 1.5 ~ 2.0 4.9 ~ 6.4 T4 stage (extrathyroidal extension, %) 13.7 ~ 19% 74% Median OS (years) 7.7 0.25 ~ 0.79 DSS (%) 1 year - 31.2 ~ 33% 5 year - 14 ~ 24% 10 year 48.6 ~ 64.6% - Vascular invasion (%) 20.2% 79% Nodal metastasis (N1, %) 23.7 ~ 56% 28 ~ 84% Recurrence (%) 1.4 ~ 8% 30.8% Distant metastasis (%) 1.4 ~ 2% 24 ~ 61% Molecular profile (%) BRAF-V600E 48.5 ~ 65% 41 ~ 59% RAS 4.5% 22 ~ 24% TP53 4.9% 59 ~ 63% TERT 4.7 ~ 22.73% 37 ~ 75% OS: overall survival; DSS: disease-specific survival. Most cellular and physiological processes, ranging from metabolism to signaling, are mediated by proteins. The structural and functional diversity of the proteome is fundamentally determined by the primary polypeptide sequences encoded by genes, while this basic framework is further enriched through PTMs [ 26 ]. So far, more than 450 unique PTMs have been found, mainly including phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, and lipidation (Fig. 1 ). These modifications can alter activity, life span, distribution and interaction of proteins, and transcend gene to regulate cellular function in response to stimuli of different factors [ 27 ]. PTMs play crucial roles in regulating cell signaling and physiology in both normal and cancerous cells. In normal cells, PTMs function as a “switch” to control the quiescent and proliferative states, enabling rapid and precise regulation of cellular status. In cancer cells, the activation or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes delivers continuous proliferation signals by co-regulating effector proteins through PTMs that influence cell survival, cell cycle progression, and proliferation. Consequently, PTMs are the core of many signaling events observed in various cancers [ 28 ]. Studies on PTMs in ATC have seen a gradual increase in recent years. Based on these mechanisms, drugs have been developed to inhibit the growth and proliferation of tumor cells by targeting the overactive or mutant proteins in the ATC signaling pathway. In this review, we provide a better understanding of PTMs in ATC, mainly including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and glycosylation. A comprehensive understanding of this mechanism is essential for validating the pathogenesis of the disease and has significant implications for the development of therapeutic drugs, as well as for disease diagnosis and treatment for both researchers and clinicians. Fig. 1 The milestone of discovering PTMs. Since the discovery of the earliest phosphorylation modifications, various PTMs have been identified over the past century. These findings have significantly strengthened the evidence for proteomics and functional research. Moreover, there may be additional or undiscovered PTMs that warrant further investigation Phosphorylation Since Phoebus Levene first discovered phosphorylation in 1906 in the protein vitellin (phosvitin), the fields of protein phosphorylation genomic and proteomics have advanced at an extraordinary rate over the past century. 9 of the 20 natural amino acids in proteins are capable of phosphorylation. Furthermore, at Least 75% of the detected proteins are phosphoproteins and more than 85% of the detected proteins are phosphorylated in specific cell Lines. And there are roughly 200,000 unique phosphorylation sites in humans [ 29 ]. Protein phosphorylation is a reversible process, mediated by protein kinases, while dephosphorylation is facilitated by phosphatases. Kinases and phosphatases maintain a dynamic balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Fig. 2 ). Currently, the human genome encodes more than 500 distinct kinases and over 200 phosphatases. The combined number of protein kinase and phosphatase genes, along with those of their regulatory subunits, accounts for nearly 2.5% of the total human gene repertoire. The most commonly phosphorylated amino acid residues are three hydroxyl amino acids, including serine, threonine, and tyrosine, followed by six non-hydroxyl amino acids, including histidine, lysine, aspartate, arginine, glutamate and cysteine [ 30 ]. Protein kinases catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphate group (PO 4 ) from ATP to specific substrate protein amino acid residues, primarily serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and tyrosine (Tyr). Consequently, kinases can be categorized into three main types: Tyr kinases, Ser/Thr kinases, and histidine kinases, based on their substrate specificity. Meanwhile, the function of these kinases is mediated by a highly conserved catalytic domain, which comprises two subdomains: the α-helical C-lobe and the β-stranded N-lobe, interconnected by a peptide strand that forms a cleft. Based on the structure of the catalytic domain, kinases can further be classified into several groups, mainly including CAMK, Akt, MAPKs, PKA, and CK1 [ 31 ]. Phosphatases can be categorized into three main superfamilies: PTP, PSP, and HAD, based on their amino acid substrates and catalytic mechanisms. Within the PTP and PSP superfamilies, specific phosphatases are responsible for dephosphorylating Tyr and Ser/Thr residues, respectively. While some HAD phosphatases can dephosphorylate Ser/Thr or Tyr residues, other phosphatases, such as PTEN and RNGTT, are involved in the dephosphorylation of non-protein substrates, including lipids and nucleic acids [ 32 ]. Fig. 2 A brief description of the biological process of protein phosphorylation. Protein kinases transfer a phosphate group from ATP or GTP to a specific amino acid residue on a substrate protein. Almost all eukaryotic protein kinases have a structurally conserved core of approximately 250 residues that folds into a bilobed structure, comprising a smaller N-lobe and a larger C-lobe. The deep cleft between these lobes serves as the binding pocket for the adenine ring of ATP. Kinase inhibitors can compete with ATP by binding to this same adenine pocket. The kinase superfamily consists of 497 eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) and 58 atypical protein kinases (aPKs). The ePK class is further categorized into nine groups: AGC, CAMK, CK1, CMGC, RGC, STE, TK, TKL and others. aPKs generally share the prototype kinase fold, lack conserved eukaryotic kinase motifs, and exhibit modified hydrophobic spines. aPKs include members such as PIK3CD, mTOR, PDHK, Alpha Brd, and ADCK3. The reversal of phosphorylation is catalyzed by protein phosphatases, which are classified into three superfamilies: PTP, PSP, and HAD. More than 100 PTPs can be further divided into three major subcategories, while PSP can be classified into two types, and the PPP subgroup including PP1, PP2A/2B, and PP4 ~ 7. (This figure was created with figdraw.com) Phosphorylation in ATC Activation of phosphorylation pathways in ATC Multiple genetic alterations associated with ATC most often lead to the dysfunction of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2-MEK1/2 signaling pathways [ 33 ]. Activation of the PI3K/Akt protein kinase pathway drives the transformation of thyroid adenomas along the FTC-ATC pathway [ 34 ]. PI3K first catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, which subsequently recruits PDK1. PDK1 activates the Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt through phosphorylation at the cell membrane. Activated Akt then phosphorylates and regulates downstream effector proteins. Additionally, PI3K is composed of a heterodimer consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit and one of several p110 catalytic subunits. The interaction of Ras with the Ras-binding domain of the PI3K subunit constitutes another tumorigenic signaling pathway, namely the MEK-ERK/MAPK pathway. The signaling pathways of PI3K/Akt and MaPK are initiated by various RTKs, including EGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR, SCFR, and HGFR, among others. In ATC, 95.8% of all RTK, PI3K/Akt, and MaPK signaling pathway genes exhibited at Least one mutation, while 77.1% harbored two or more mutations [ 35 ]. Akt is a Ser/Thr protein kinase activated through insulin PI3K. There are three isoforms of Akt, including Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3. Krześlak et al. found that Akt1 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm in benign thyroid lesions and DTC. However, it was located in the nucleus in ATC. Additionally, the ratio of phosphorylated Akt1 to total Akt1 was lower in cancers than in normal thyroid tissue and adenomas [ 36 ]. A recent ATC integrative proteogenomic characterization study revealed that the phosphorylation pathway and the alterations in the levels of related kinases were significant contributors to ATC progression. MAPK3 (ERK1) and MAPK1 (ERK2) were associated with oncogenic processes such as cell motility, proliferation, and survival. Patients exhibiting higher CDK1 expression tended to have a worse prognosis, while those with elevated AURKB levels demonstrated significantly shorter OS compared to patients with lower AURKB levels. Furthermore, increased levels of phosphorylated ERBB2 (Ser1054) might correlate with poorer outcomes [ 37 ]. Consequently, variations in these kinase levels are critical markers for specific therapies and patient survival. EGFR, a transmembrane cell surface glycoprotein, is one of the four members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (Her/ErbB) family. It consists of an extracellular module and an intracellular kinase domain, spanning the membrane through a single helix that is connected by a juxtamembrane segment. In its inactive state, EGFR can exist as monomers or dimers. However, upon activation by EGF, dimerization of the kinase domain drives cell proliferation and migration [ 38 ]. VEGFRs consist of three protein-tyrosine kinases (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3) and two nonprotein kinase coreceptors (neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2). VEGFRs are composed of seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a tyrosine kinase domain. VEGFR-2 is stimulated by VEGF-A, C, D and E to induce receptor dimerization, leading to protein kinase activation and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular region of the receptor. In general, EGFR and VEGF share common downstream signaling pathways, which can operate independently during tumorigenesis [ 39 ]. EGFR and VEGFR-2 are both overexpressed in most ATCs. EGFR, VEGFR-2, and their downstream signaling kinases, Akt and MAPK, are phosphorylated under the stimulation of EGF. Besides, Liang et al. demonstrated that CXCL11 interacts with the CXCR7 receptor, leading to upregulation of EGFR expression. Intriguingly, EGFR activation reciprocally enhances CXCL11 production, establishing a positive feedback loop that promotes angiogenesis in ATC [ 40 ]. CXCR4, another transmembrane chemokine receptor, is associated with the malignancy of thyroid tumors and is highly expressed in ATC. Elevated CXCR4 levels activate kinase cascades, specifically ERK1/2 and Akt, through the activation of the Gβγ subunit of the Gi protein. Additionally, CXCR4 serves as a receptor for the SDF-1/CXCL12 chemokine. When ATC cells are stimulated with SDF-1, there is an increase in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and PKB/Akt, which subsequently promotes ATC proliferation. This biological process can be inhibited by CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 [ 41 ]. However, Hwang et al. suggested that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis could enhance ATC migration without affecting proliferation. The activation of SDF-1α/CXCR4 resulted in the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and its target, ribosomal S6 protein, as well as the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, but did not affect STAT1, STAT3, or NF-κB [ 42 ]. NF-κB is involved in the transcription of various target genes of cell proliferation, apoptosis and metabolic reprogramming. After phosphorylated, p65 binds to p50 to form a heterodimer, which then translocates to the nucleus and participates in the formation of NF-κB hetero-dimerization, nuclear translocation and functional activation. However, melatonin significantly inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65, thereby inducing apoptosis and ROS of ATC cells, ultimately inhibiting proliferation and migration [ 43 ]. EGF stimulation can also significantly enhance membrane ruffling and filopodia formation in ATC, thereby promoting the cell migration. Additionally, EGF markedly increases the phosphorylation of ERK and p38. ERK phosphorylates and activates RSK, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation and activation of cAMP response CREB. Ultimately, CREB facilitates the secretion of a substantial amount of Cyr61 protein by ATC cells, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and accelerates tumor migration [ 44 ]. Another transmembrane protein, JAM-A, is also an important regulator of EMT. JAM-A expression is down-regulated in ATC compared with normal thyroid tissues and PTC, while overexpression of JAM-A results in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of p53 and GSK3α/β proteins and inhibits ATC migration [ 45 ]. Similarly, apoptosis mediated by inflammatory factors determines the diverse developmental fates of cells. Disturbances in the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors can lead to cancer development. A subsequent research confirmed that ATC cells could produce substantial amounts of IL-4 and IL-10, which promoted the increased phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT6, STAT3, Akt, and GSKβ. This phosphorylation subsequently activated the JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Once activated, STAT proteins migrated to the nucleus where they induced the expression of SOCS family members. Notably, the expression levels of SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS5 were lower in ATC compared to DTC. SOCS1 and SOCS3 could inhibit JAK tyrosine kinase activity through their NH2-terminal kinase inhibitory region. Furthermore, the exogenous expression of SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS5 could reduce or completely abolish the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT6, as well as the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in ATC. This alteration resulted in an imbalance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules. And the exogenous expression of SOCS3 significantly reduced tumor growth and markedly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo [ 46 ]. ATC cells also produce a substantial amount of IL-6, which significantly elevates the level of kinase Src in human thyroid fibroblasts adjacent to ATC cells. This elevation activates the downstream Akt signaling pathway, leading to the reprogramming of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and promoting inflammation within the tumor microenvironment. Once activated, CAFs exhibited a markedly increased proliferation rate and induction of EMT, furtherly enhancing the migration and invasion of thyroid tumor cells [ 47 ]. In ATC bone metastasis, IL-6 secreted by tumor cells can also stimulate osteoblasts to produce RANKL through gp130/STAT3, which subsequently activates osteoclasts, leading to osteolytic bone destruction. Although metformin does not exhibit sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effects of ATC in vivo, it inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 via AMPK. This inhibition ultimately blocks the production of RANKL by osteoblasts induced by cancer cells and reduces osteoclast differentiation, thereby effectively mitigating the metastatic growth of ATC within the bone microenvironment [ 48 ]. S100A8, a member of EF hand calcium-binding protein superfamily, can interact with RAGE to promote the proliferation and lung metastasis of ATC by activating the p38, ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation signaling pathways [ 49 ]. In addition, the combined application of metformin and sorafenib can inhibit ATC and its stemness characteristics, especially for doxorubicin-resistant ATC. Importantly, the administration of metformin can significantly reduce the dose of sorafenib, thereby attenuating the toxic side effects [ 50 ]. During normal cell division, the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase is regulated by complexes formed by D-type cyclins, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6. Moreover, the expression of CDK2 is associated with a reduced OS rate in ATC patients [ 51 ]. These complexes phosphorylate and inactivate the Rb tumor suppressor. However, tumor cells can bypass the G1 checkpoint through mechanisms such as increased expression of cyclin D, elevated levels of CDK4 and CDK6, or inactivation of RB1. The inactivation of Rb can directly promote the progression of cells into the S phase, which is one of the important factors in the occurrence of malignant tumors [ 52 ]. Notably, the tumor suppressor function of RB1 is mediated by its translation product, the RB protein (pRb). Phosphorylation of pRb at various sites exerts distinct effects on cellular functions. During the G1/S phase transition, the CDK4/6 complex docks at the C-terminal helix of pRb, facilitating site-specific phosphorylation of pRb (S780, S795, S249, or T252). This phosphorylation promotes the dissociation of pRb from chromatin and activates the transcriptional activity of E2F1 [ 53 ]. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is important for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis as well as tumor development. The IGFBP family is composed of seven structural homologous proteins (IGFBP1 ~ IGFBP7), which bind IGF-I and IGF-II, carry and transfer these IGFs, thus regulating the biological functions of IGFs. IGFBP7 can be independent of IGF signaling pathway and participate in a variety of pathophysiological processes. Zhang et al. found that IGFBP7 expression was significantly reduced or even absent in ATC compared to normal thyroid tissue, adenomas, and PTC. However, the overexpression of IGFBP7 inhibited ATC growth. The underlying mechanism involved the upregulation of two CDK inhibitors, p21 Cip1 and p27 Kip1 , which was accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of Rb and a downregulation of the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308 sites. These changes led to G1-S phase arrest in the cell cycle, resulting in subsequent growth inhibition [ 54 ]. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) can increase the levels of p21 Cip1 and p27 Kip1 and decrease the phosphorylation of Rb protein as mentioned above. Moreover, PMA can also stimulate the translocation of PKCα, βI and δ isoforms to the cell membrane, and reduce the phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt, thereby effectively inhibiting the proliferation and migration ability of ATC [ 55 ]. In general, the pathways governed by PI3K/Akt and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 play a central role in the progression of ATC, which is summarized in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 Phosphorylation modification signaling pathway diagram during ATC progression. During the progression of ATC, various stimulating factors activate a series of phosphorylation signaling pathways in tumor cells by binding to surface receptors. This activation leads to the rapid proliferation of ATC and its invasion into surrounding tissues Drug applications targeting phosphorylation According to the American Thyroid Association Guidelines, targeted therapies have emerged as the most significant treatment options for ATC, with the majority of these therapies being kinase inhibitors [ 56 ]. In Table 2 , we have summarized additional relevant drugs and their downstream targets.

[ 65 ] Sorafenib, a first-generation kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA, primarily targets RAF kinase and VEGFRs. Its therapeutic mechanism involves dual inhibition of both the RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway and angiogenesis. Clinical evidence has demonstrated that sorafenib exhibits particular efficacy in malignancies responsive to VEGFR inhibition, such as thyroid cancer [ 66 ]. The MEK inhibitor trametinib can reactivate Rb function and treat ATC by up-regulating CDK inhibitors (p15, p27 and p21) and converting the phosphorylated inactive form of Rb protein to the non-phosphorylated active form [ 67 ]. MEK and p42/44 ERK, downstream signaling effectors of BRAF, are activated by phosphorylation of BRAF and MEK itself. BRAF mutations were T-A transversions at position 1799, which corresponds to the Change of valine to glutamate in codon 600 (V600E). BRAF-V600E increases ERK phosphorylation in mitochondria. p-ERK further phosphorylates GSK3β in mitochondria, thereby significantly increasing the p-GSK/GSK level. Furthermore, ERK is constitutively activated by BRAF-V600E , which inhibits GSK3-dependent phosphorylation of the mitochondrial chaperone cyclophilin D (CypD), making it more difficult for BRAF-V600E mutant ATC cells to open mPTP, leading to cell death resistance [ 68 ]. Approximately 30% of ATC patients harbor the BRAF-V600E mutation [ 69 ]. A study found that ATC patients with positive BRAF-V600E mutation had a 42% reduction in tumor diameter after 2 months of trametinib treatment. Although 67% of these patients underwent surgical intervention, achieving R1/R2 resection, they ultimately died from disease progression [ 70 ]. In several other studies, ATC patients with NTRK -fusion positive tumors treated with larotrectinib or entrectinib resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 75% and 57.4% respectively [ 71 , 72 ]. For ATC patients with RET -fusion positive tumors, selpercatinib or pralsetinib Led to an ORR of 79% and 89%, respectively [ 73 , 74 ]. Another kinase inhibitor, Ruxo, was initially approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis. A subsequent study revealed that Ruxo inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, which led to the inhibition of DRP1 transactivation and impaired mitochondrial fission through the JAK1/2-STAT3 signaling pathway in ATC. Additionally, it activated caspase 9/3-dependent apoptosis and GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in ATC cells [ 75 ]. However, the expression of GSDME is low in most tumor cell Lines due to methylation of the GSDME gene promoter, whereas GSDME is widely overexpressed in normal cell Lines. Therefore, related drugs can also induce caspase 3-mediated pyroptosis in normal cells with overexpression of GSDME, which may be one of the reasons for the toxic side effects of related treatments [ 76 ]. During the process of pyroptosis, cells secrete and release a substantial quantity of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1 and IL-18, through the pores formed by N-GSDMD. This activity activates and recruits immune cells, mediating immune responses characterized by the infiltration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Conversely, this inflammatory response may also facilitate tumor invasion, thereby heightening the risk of tumorigenesis and metastasis [ 77 ]. Hence, single-agent targeted drug therapy has demonstrated limited therapeutic efficacy in ATC. Some kinase inhibitors exhibit extremely low antitumor activity in ATC cell lines, and no constitutive kinase activity suitable for targeting with inhibitors has been identified in these cell lines [ 78 ]. In recent years, the combination of multiple drugs has increasingly become the standard approach. Dabrafenib plus trametinib combination is the first-line FDA-approved targeted therapy for BRAF -mutant ATC. In a recent cohort study, this combination demonstrated an ORR of 56% in patients with BRAF-V600E mutation ATC, including 3 complete responses. The median duration of response (DOR) was sustained, with a 12-month DOR rate of 50%. Additionally, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were 6.7 months and 14.5 months, respectively. At 12 months, the OS and PFS rates were 43.2% and 51.7%, respectively [ 79 ]. Gunda et al. proposed that a combination of axitinib and BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib and PLX4720) showed better inhibitory effects in BRAF-V600E -mutant ATC cell lines. This was because dabrafenib and PLX4720 blocked ATC cells in G0/G1 phase through ERK pathway, while axitinib could arrest ATC cells in G2/M phase by reducing the phosphorylation of Aurora kinase B (Thr232) and histone H3 (Ser10) proteins and up-regulating the c-JUN signaling pathway [ 80 ]. Besides, the combined treatment of dabrafenib with erlotinib or trametinib has shown better outcomes compared to monotherapy. This combination therapy yields a more satisfactory therapeutic effect [ 81 ]. Lenvatinib, as one of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, can also target VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, FGFR1-4 and PDGFR. Compared with the use of lenvatinib alone, combined treatment with vinorelbine in ATC can increase the intracellular drug concentration of lenvatinib and more significantly reduce the phosphorylation levels of kinases Src, Akt, and GSK3α/β in ATC cells [ 82 ]. The combination of lenvatinib and other drugs to enhance treatment efficacy was also described in another study. IRAK1/4 inhibitor I could enhance the inhibitory effect of lenvatinib on ERK phosphorylation in ATC cells and then increased the percentage of cells in G2/M phase, thereby showing stronger anti-proliferation and anti-vascular effects [ 83 ]. However, the synergistic effect of lenvatinib combined with other drugs remains unclear. This is an interesting direction worth exploring. Phosphorylation mechanisms in ATC treatment resistance One of the most pressing concerns regarding ATC is its resistance to various treatment modalities, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapies. Several studies have proposed strategies to enhance the sensitivity of ATC to these treatments while simultaneously mitigating the underlying resistance mechanisms. Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) abnormality is the potential cause of chromosome instability, and the BUB1 mitotic checkpoint Ser/Thr kinase (BUB1) plays a central role in mitotic chromosome alignment and SAC. BUB1 can bind to KIF4 and phosphorylate it at the Ser1292 site, resulting in the disruption of spindle formation and the emergence of monopolar and asymmetric spindles. This disruption induces aberrant chromosome segregation, ultimately leading to the progression of PTC to ATC and showing the characteristics of high invasion and drug resistance [ 84 ]. Dabrafenib plus trametinib combination may induce resistance of ATC. This is primarily because this combination targets the same signaling pathway, which may lead to the activation of alternative compensatory pathways, such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which can result in continuous tumor growth [ 85 ]. It is important to note that not all drug combinations yield the enhanced effects described above. For instance, while both dabrafenib and trametinib are capable of inhibiting ERK phosphorylation, their combination does not exhibit any additional inhibitory effect in OCUT-4 cells (an ATC cell line). Instead, this drug combination can lead to an increase in SNAI1 expression, which is associated with the development of drug resistance [ 86 ]. VEGFR-2 activates PI3K, which results in an increase in the lipid phosphatidylinositol P3 and activation of several important intracellular molecules, such as Akt. Gomez-Rivera et al. revealed that AZD2171 also inhibited phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Akt and MAPK. Since endothelial cells of ATC highly expressed VEGFR-2, the application of AZD2171 could induce apoptosis of ATC endothelial cells and inhibit angiogenesis simultaneously [ 87 ]. Notably, upregulated EGFR can enhance VEGF expression through a hypoxia-independent mechanism, while elevated VEGF subsequently contributes to resistance against EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ 88 ]. Feng et al. identified FOXK2 as a critical mediator of antiangiogenic therapy resistance in ATC. Their study revealed that upon VEGFR2 blockade by targeted agents (e.g., apatinib), FOXK2 upregulated VEGFA expression, which subsequently bound to VEGFR1 as a compensatory mechanism. This VEGFA-VEGFR1 interaction reactivated angiogenic signaling through ERK, PI3K/AKT, and p38/MAPK pathways. Furthermore, VEGFA-VEGFR1 engagement enhanced FOXK2-dependent transcriptional activation of VEGFA, establishing a potent feedforward loop that sustains angiogenesis despite anti-VEGFR2 therapy [ 58 ]. Another factor contributing to the resistance of ATC to radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the capacity of cancer cells to repair DNA damage. While these treatments can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in ATC, tumor cells can subsequently repair this damage through homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR requires pairing with homologous chromatids in late S phase and G2 phase of the cell cycle. The NHEJ can be initiated outside the S and G2 phases and requires limited sequence homology. NHEJ is initiated by the Ku70/Ku80 complex, which interacts with DSBs and recruits other components, including DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), DNA Ligase IV, endonuclease Artemis, X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), and polymerases µ and λ (Pol µ and Pol λ). Phosphorylated DNA-PKcs activates Artemis, which then degrades DNA ends. At the same time, DNA ligase IV is activated by XRCC4 and transfers AMP to the 5’-end of the DSB to initiate end ligation [ 89 ]. The NHEJ process is more error-prone than HR and leads to genome instability or chromosome splitting [ 90 ]. This may lead to the loss of tumor suppressor genes and the amplification of oncogenes to increase the aggressiveness of ATC. RI-1 and SCR7 can inhibit the central recombination protein RAD51 in the HR pathway and DNA ligase IV in the NHEJ pathway, respectively, thereby reducing the resistance of ATC to radiotherapy and doxorubicin [ 91 ]. Wang et al. identified that KLF5 could drive doxorubicin resistance in ATC. Inhibition of KLF5 resulted in reduced expression of multidrug resistance gene 1/permeability glycoprotein and ATP-binding cassette superfamily G member 2, leading to a decrease in the level of phosphorylated JNK. This inhibition subsequently suppressed the proliferation of ATC and enhanced its sensitivity to doxorubicin [ 92 ]. Ubiquitination In 1977, Goldknopf et al. discovered that histones could be modified through ubiquitination, which was the second most common PTM of proteins after phosphorylation. Ubiquitin (Ub) is a highly conserved cytoplasmic protein consisting of 76 amino acid residues. Ub tags substrate proteins and is activated through the sequential actions of Ub-activating enzyme (E1), Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) and Ub ligase (E3). Briefly, E1 utilizes the energy generated by ATP to activate the Cys residue of Ub, forming an E1 ~ Ub conjugate. Subsequently, the activated Ub is transferred to the catalytic cysteine of E2, resulting in the formation of the E2 ~ Ub conjugate (~ represents the thioester bond). E3 then binds to the E2 ~ Ub conjugates and the target proteins to facilitate the formation of isopeptide bonds between the C-terminal carboxyl group of Ub and the lysine residue of the ubiquitin substrate or the N-terminal methionine of the substrate [ 93 , 94 ]. Different types of ubiquitination result in varied fates for substrate proteins, which depend on their seven lysine residue types (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63) and an N-terminal methionine (Met1). Notably, Lys48-linked polyubiquitination primarily targets proteins for recognition and degradation via the 26S proteasome, while Lys11-linked polyubiquitination is also implicated in proteolysis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a crucial role in the degradation of over 80% of cellular proteins [ 95 ]. Like other PTMs, ubiquitination is reversibly regulated by deubiquitination. This process is regulated by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which can remove Ub from target proteins and disaggregate Ub polymers to counteract the biological effects of E3 Ub ligases. DUBs can be classified into two major groups based on their sequence and domain conservation: cysteine proteases and metalloproteinases. Cysteine proteases can be further subdivided into six families: USPs, UCH, MJD, OTU, MINDYs, and ZUFSP [ 96 ]. DUBs contain one or more substrate recognition binding domains, including ZnF motifs, ubiquitin-like domains (UBL), coiled-coil domains and ubiquitin interaction motifs. These domains interact with an indispensable catalytic domain for precise control of hydrolysis. Catalytic activity of DUBs is also regulated by a variety of manners, including substrate‐assisted catalysis, allosteric regulation, and PTMs. To some extent, due to the close functional interaction and reciprocity between E3 ligases and DUBs, ubiquitination and deubiquitination frequently occur simultaneously in both time and space. This process jointly regulates tumor apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis [ 97 ] (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Biological processes of the ubiquitin-proteasome recycling system. The target protein is covalently linked to several Ub molecules through the sequential actions of ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and ubiquitin ligase E3. This process culminates in the specific recognition and degradation of the protein into small peptides by the 26S proteasome. Subsequently, these peptides are further degraded into amino acids by cytoplasmic proteases. Concurrently, DUBs remove the ubiquitin moiety from substrate proteins with high specificity, thereby reversing ubiquitin signaling to maintain dynamic cellular ubiquitination. Ub contains seven lysine residues that can all be ubiquitinated, leading to the formation of isopeptide-linked ubiquitin chains. Additionally, an eighth type of chain, known as Met1-linked or ‘linear’ chains, is formed when Ub is attached to the N-terminus of a second Ub molecule. (This figure was created with figdraw.com) Ubiquitination in ATC The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates ATC progression ATXN3 is one of DUBs that can interact with the ATPase VCP/p97, various ubiquitin ligases, and other ubiquitin-related proteins to control the stability or activity of a variety of proteins in different pathways [ 98 , 99 ]. eIF5A2 belongs to the eIF family and is located on chromosome 3q26. eIF5A2 is involved in the initiation of protein translation by interacting with ribosomal subunits and mRNAs to form an elongation competent complex. The high expression of eIF5A2 is positively correlated with the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells [ 100 ]. eIF5A2 is regulated by various PTMs, including acetylation, ubiquitination, and sulfation [ 101 ]. The expression of eIF5A2 is upregulated in ATC. Zhang et al. suggested that this upregulation might be associated with the high mutation rate of BRAF-V600E in ATC. Furthermore, the BRAF-V600E mutation appeared to be enhanced in tissues that exhibit overexpression of eIF5A2. However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation [ 102 ]. A previous study demonstrated that ATXN3, an essential deubiquitinase, stabilized substrate proteins by preventing their binding to ubiquitin. It accomplishes this by directly interacting with EIF5A2, thereby inhibiting its ubiquitination and enhancing its stability. In ATC cells, this inhibition of eIF5A2’s ubiquitination and degradation promoted both the proliferation and metastasis of ATC cells [ 103 ]. And overexpression of eIF5A2 could then activate TGF-β signaling by up-regulating SMAD3 phosphorylation, thus leading to the proliferation and distant metastasis of ATC [ 104 ]. The potential mechanism by which ATXN3 contributes to tumorigenesis was subsequently elucidated by Hernández-Carralero et al. ATXN3 regulated chromatin structure and DNA replication timing through the recruitment of HDAC3 in the nucleus. ATXN3 contains a polyglutamine (PolyQ) region, where either the absence of or the expansion of the PolyQ tract could sequester the proper recruitment of HDAC3 to chromatin, leading to increased global transcription levels [ 105 ]. For instance, the PolyQ region of ATXN3 could interact with BECN1 to induce autophagy [ 106 ]. However, whether ATXN3 regulates eIF5A2 or other factors in the same way remains to be further verified in ATC. Currently, it is established that dysregulation of the Hippo pathway plays a crucial role in the invasion and metastasis of various tumors. This pathway is strictly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. YAP/TAZ-TEAD serve as downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, and their activation can promote cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. Their activity can also be regulated in a Hippo-independent manner through a cascade of kinases. The activities of YAP and TAZ are primarily modulated by MST1/2- LATS1/2 kinase-mediated phosphorylation, which facilitates their retention in the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation via the β-TRCP-mediated proteasome pathway. When Hippo signaling is inactive, YAP and TAZ translocate to the nucleus, where they recruit additional factors to activate genes associated with cell proliferation, migration, survival, and metabolism [ 107 ]. Moreover, YAP and TAZ are also regulated by ubiquitination within this biological process. Tang et al. revealed that YAP promoted the proliferation of ATC. This occurred through the action of the deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL3, which reduced the ubiquitination level of YAP, thereby enhancing its stability. Its increased stability led to elevated YAP protein levels, YAP/TEAD gene expression, and Hippo signaling activity, without affecting YAP mRNA expression. Concurrently, YAP activated UCHL3 transcription by binding to the UCHL3 promoter through TEAD. Inhibiting UCHL3 or the application of its inhibitors, TCID, impeded the growth and metastasis of ATC cells [ 108 ]. Another deubiquitinating enzyme, USP26, can also combine with TAZ, ultimately promoting ATC development by deubiquitinating TAZ and increasing its stability [ 109 ]. In the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, another study demonstrated that the knockdown of TRIM11, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, significantly decreased YAP protein expression, thus inhibiting the activity of the Hippo signaling pathway. The RING domain of TRIM11 interacted with the YAP WW domain to regulate YAP stability and enhanced its mono-ubiquitination level through protein-protein interaction. The depletion of TRIM11 reduced the proliferation and migration capacity of ATC cells via YAP, while also increasing their sensitivity to chemotherapy [ 110 ]. In summary, the Hippo signaling pathway is co-regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, with both its activation and dysregulation contributing to the progression of ATC (Fig. 5 ) [ 111 , 112 ]. E3 ubiquitin ligases can be categorized into three families based on their structural characteristics and mechanisms of action: RING E3s, HECT E3s, and RBR E3s. Both TRIM protein family and SCF (SKP1/Cullin1/F-box) E3 ligases belong to RING E3 ligases, which are characterized by the presence of a RING domain at the N-terminus. However, each subfamily possesses distinct additional domains [ 113 , 114 ]. The SCF E3 ligase is composed of four subunits: SKP1 protein, Cullin1 protein, RBX1 protein, and a variable F-box protein. Among these, RBX1 is capable of ubiquitinating and degrading SMAR1, which disrupts the formation of the SMAR1/HDAC6 complex. This disruption regulates the selective splicing process of PKM, resulting in a significantly higher ratio of PKM2/PKM1, ultimately contributing to the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) and the migration of ATC [ 115 ]. Esposito et al. found that KLHL14 was the substrate-binding subunit of the Cullin-RING Ligase 3 ubiquitin ligase complex, highly enriched in normal thyroid tissue. The BTB/POZ domain of KLHL14 interacted with Cullin 3, while the Kelch domain was responsible for recruiting specific substrates and the BACK domain served as a linker. KLHL14 was a critical factor for maintaining normal thyroid differentiation, and its downregulation, along with alterations in nucleocytoplasmic distribution, was the early characteristic of de-differentiation in ATC [ 116 ]. Cullin4B, a scaffold protein within the Cullin4B-Ring E3 ligase complex, promotes ARID1A ubiquitination through its K48 site, subsequently suppressing PAX8 transcriptional activity. This molecular cascade drives thyroid tumor progression toward ATC. Clinically, elevated Cullin4B expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics, including larger tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, TNM stage, and higher recurrence rates. Therefore, it may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing disease severity [ 117 ]. Fig. 5 The regulatory mechanisms of ubiquitination and phosphorylation within the Hippo signaling pathway in ATC. The core components of the Hippo pathway comprise a kinase cascade alongside ubiquitination regulatory processes. The MST1/2 kinases, in conjunction with SAV1, form a complex that phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2. Subsequently, the LATS1/2 kinases phosphorylate and regulate YAP/TAZ. Additionally, the stability of YAP/TAZ is modulated by various ubiquitinating enzymes including USP26, UBR1, UCHL3, and TRIM11, facilitating their eventual translocation into the nucleus to promote the transcription of multiple factors, which ultimately drives the proliferation of ATC SUMOylation in ATC In addition to Ub, the Ub superfamily includes UBL proteins that not only share sequence homology and structural similarity with Ub but also utilize analogous enzymatic cascades to modify their substrate proteins [ 118 ]. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), a UBL protein, is widely expressed in eukaryotes. The amino acid sequence identity between SUMO and ubiquitin is approximately 18%. SUMOylation refers to the process by which SUMO is covalently attached to its substrate, forming an isopeptide bond between its terminal glycine and the lysine residue of the substrate. Unlike ubiquitination, SUMOylation is primarily responsible for regulating the cell cycle, cell signaling, and DNA synthesis [ 119 ]. SUMOylation is a multi-step enzymatic cascade, including maturation, activation, conjugation, and deconjugation. Initially, SUMO proteins are processed by SENP. Then a high-energy thioester bond is formed between the C-terminal SUMO and the active site cysteine of SAE1/2. The activated SUMO is subsequently transferred to a cysteine residue located in the active site of SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9. Ultimately, it is transferred to a target lysine with the assistance of UBC9 and the SUMO E3 ligase [ 120 ]. In tumor cells, SUMOylation primarily influences protein stability, protein interactions, protein translocation, phase separation, and transcriptional activity. Additionally, it is induced by abnormal gene expression, thereby impacting cell cycle progression, signaling pathway transduction, DNA damage response, and RNA metabolism, all of which contribute to the disruption of cellular homeostasis [ 121 ]. Compared to normal thyroid tissue, thyroid cancer exhibits altered SUMOylation patterns of certain oncogenic factors, such as PDGF-C, and tumor suppressor factors, such as CCDC6, which contribute to sustained tumor growth [ 122 ]. During the EMT, cancer cells downregulate epithelial differentiation markers and upregulate genes associated with stemness, including CD44, whose expression is regulated by the transcription factor TFAP2A. The de-differentiation of thyroid cancer into ATC is partially attributed to the SUMOylation of TFAP2A. SUMOylation inhibition reduces CD44 expression, thus suppressing ATC proliferation [ 123 ]. PIAS2β, an E3 SUMO ligase, accumulated at the mitotic spindle during mitosis of ATC cells. PIAS2β could bind to spindle kinases (AURKA, PLK1), tubulin (TUBB3) and proteasomes (PSMC5), resulting in their SUMOylation. Silencing PIAS2β through dsRNAi disrupted ATC spindle assembly, chromosome-microtubule attachment, and pre-activated the proteasome during mitosis, which induced centrosome alterations and mitotic arrest at kinetochores, leading to a return to interphase or cell death [ 124 ]. Xu et al. demonstrated that ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 also enhanced the stemness and growth of ATC while reducing sensitivity to doxorubicin. This effect was attributed to ISG15-mediated ISGylation of KPNA2, which inhibits its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Consequently, this promoted the nuclear translocation of c-MYC, ultimately leading to the transcription of stemness genes (OCT4, NANOG, and CD133) [ 125 ]. Ubiquitination mechanisms in ATC invasiveness The aforementioned studies mainly focused on the growth of ATC tumors, but did not address the mechanisms underlying ATC’s susceptibility to invasion and metastasis. As previously noted, these two characteristics are critical factors contributing to the refractory characteristic of treatment and low survival rate associated with ATC. This is attributable to the EMT of tumors, which results in the loss of apical-basal polarity and adherent junctions, thereby enhancing the motility and invasiveness of tumor cells [ 126 ]. Generally, the EMT process is initiated by the induction of EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs), primarily including Snail, Twist, and Zeb. This process is regulated either individually or collectively by various DUBs. Surprisingly, no single DUB has yet been identified as the main regulator of EMT-TFs. Different EMT-TFs correspond to distinct DUBs regulated mechanisms across different tumor types [ 127 ]. In most thyroid tumor types, Zhu et al. found that the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF115 was significantly upregulated, which reduced the stability of kinase CDK10 by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This process contributed to the occurrence of EMT in thyroid tumors [ 128 ]. RACK1, a ubiquitin-associated scaffold protein, has been identified as a key mediator of therapy resistance in ATC. Kinase inhibitor treatment attenuates CDK2’s binding with RACK1 and FBW7, consequently reducing CDK2 ubiquitination. This leads to CDK2 accumulation in the cytoplasm and enhanced Rb phosphorylation, ultimately driving tumor cell proliferation [ 51 ]. Recent research by Pan et al. demonstrated that the elevation of HN1, a microtubule-associated protein, promoted EMT in ATC, facilitating the migration and invasion of ATC cells. This effect occurred because HN1 downregulates ubiquitin-1 (UBQLN1) within the ubiquitin-proteasome system, inhibiting the binding of UBQLN1 to STMN1, which subsequently led to the ubiquitination and degradation of STMN1. Concurrently, HN1 and STMN1 collaborated to decrease the acetylation of α-tubulin, ultimately resulting in tumor invasion and a poor prognosis for ATC patients [ 129 ]. Fang et al. found that the knockout of ASPM significantly reduced the transcript levels of Vimentin, N-cadherin, and Snail, while simultaneously increasing the levels of E-cadherin and Occludin, thereby inhibiting EMT of ATC. This was mainly due to the fact that knocking out ASPM could promote ubiquitin-mediated degradation of KIF11, which subsequently inhibits the motility of ATC cells [ 130 ]. Notably, Cullin-RING ligases are more likely to recognize and interact with proteins that possess phosphorylated Ser/Thr rich degrons. However, in certain instances, it can disrupt the interaction between the substrate and the Cullin-RING ligase when either of them is phosphorylated [ 131 ]. Acetylation In a comprehensive Pan-cancer cohort study involving 1110 patients across 11 cancer types, Geffen et al. demonstrated that alterations in protein site phosphorylation (~ 22000 sites/patient) and acetylation (∼6000 sites/patient) constitute the major pathogenic factor. Morover, acetylation drove metabolic regulation associated with the immune response [ 132 ]. Histone acetylation was the first protein found to be acetylated in the 1960s. Certain lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histones are acetylated in histone acetylation. This process is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and antagonized by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Afterwards, non-histone lysine residues were also found to be acetylated in the 1980 s, and these enzymes were renamed lysine acetyltransferases (KATs). Acetylation can be divided into N-terminal acetylation and lysine acetylation according to the amino group of the lysine residue where acetylation occurs. N-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by Nα-acetyltransferase (NAT) in an irreversible manner. NAT transfers activated acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA to the α-amino group of the first amino acid residue of the protein. While lysine acetylation is reversible. Lysine deacetylase enzymes include Zn 2+ -dependent HDACs and NAD-dependent SIRTs, which can catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from protein lysine residues [ 133 , 134 ]. In contrast, HDACs represent a family of 18 enzymes that function oppositely to HATs. HDACs remove acetyl groups from lysine residues, which act as corepressors of transcription, thereby reducing the acetylation level of histones [ 135 ]. The biological effects of HDACs vary according to the type of tumor. They can be categorized into two groups. The first group consists of zinc-dependent HDACs, which are classified into four classes based on their homology, sequence similarity, and expression patterns. Classes I and IIa each contain four members (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8 and HDAC4, 5, 7, 9); class IIb includes two members (HDAC6 and HDAC10); while class IV has only one member (HDAC11). The second group, known as the sirtuin family, consists of seven members (SIRT1 ~ SIRT7) that require nicotinamide adenine NAD for their activity [ 136 ]. Acetylation in ATC Dysregulation of acetylation promotes ATC progression As previously mentioned, HN1 could promote the progression of ATC through the ubiquitination pathway. Concurrently, Pan et al. found that HN1 also influenced chromatin accessibility within ATC via acetylation, leading to thyroid differentiation marker loss and enhanced tumor stemness. CTCF was a crucial factor in the formation of loops within chromatin structure and facilitated chromatin opening in the promoter regions of transcription factors responsible for cell differentiation in ATC. HN1 could inhibit the acetylation of H3K27 at the CTCF promoter by recruiting HDAC2, thereby suppressing the transcriptional activation of CTCF and ultimately promoting the growth of ATC [ 137 ].The expression levels of HDAC1/2 are associated with the malignant degree of thyroid tumors. In the immunohistochemical staining of normal thyroid tissue, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are not expressed. In contrast, their expression Levels in PTC are found to be 61% and 53%, respectively. In ATC, these Levels can reach as high as 80% and 92%. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis), SAHA and MS-275 can induce apoptosis in ATC cells without affecting normal thyroid cells. SAHA and MS-275 have been shown to activate the mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways (caspase-8/9). Additionally, SAHA treats ATC by stabilizing the TRAIL protein through the reduction of TRAIL ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [ 138 ]. A recent study revealed a potential mechanism linking acetylation and apoptosis. During the early stages of apoptosis, caspase-3 cleaved and hydrolyzed specific proteins, generating new neo-N-termini. These terminal fragments could subsequently undergo acetylation, thereby influencing the stability, folding, and expression of the associated proteins [ 139 ]. Caspase-3 can be processed by caspase-10, a close homolog of caspase-8. Caspase-10 cleaves ACLY at the conserved Asp1026 site, thereby eliminating its activity, which in turn inhibits the production of Acetyl-CoA and its associated lipogenesis. Concurrently, caspase-10-mediated cleavage of ACLY impairs histone acetyltransferase GCN5 activity and downregulates the levels of H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac at the promoters of tumor proliferation genes (CCND1, CCNE2) and metastasis genes (FN1, MMP9, ZEB1), ultimately resulting in a reduction of tumor volume and metastasis [ 140 ]. Limitations and possibilities of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of ATC Currently, several studies have demonstrated that HDACis can inhibit ATC (Fig. 6 ), as summarized in Table 3 . However, some noteworthy concerns have been raised. Most of these studies only demonstrate the relevant gene changes induced by the use of inhibitors, leaving it unclear whether these genes are directly acetylated. Moreover, the specific acetylase affected by related drugs is not clear. Currently, approved HDACis can lead to serious adverse reactions, off-target toxicity, and limited therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors [ 141 ]. A significant factor contributing to the suboptimal treatment outcomes in solid tumors is the emergence of drug resistance. Alarmingly, ATC also exhibits pronounced drug resistance [ 142 ], and it remains uncertain whether the application of related inhibitors may lead to alterations in drug resistance. A recent study identified the potential causes of drug resistance associated with HDACis. In drug-resistant tumor cells, the biological processes related to small subunit ribosomal RNA were notably enriched, including ribosome biogenesis, ribosome assembly and rRNA metabolism. Notably, ribosome biogenesis proteins such as MRTO4, PES1, WDR74, and NOP16 might influence tumor sensitivity to HDACis. Additionally, the phosphokinases PRKDC, PDK1, and ROCK played crucial roles in modulating protein phosphorylation during DNA repair, which was the key mechanism underlying tumor resistance to HDACis [ 143 ].

[ 152 ] Fig. 6 Potential mechanism of HADCis inhibiting ATC. The functional region of HDAC comprises a cap group, a linker, and a ZBG. The -OH group of the ZBG interacts with Zn 2+ in HDAC, producing an inhibitory effect. However, the hydroxamate moiety utilized as the ZBG can also undergo degradation through Lossen rearrangement, leading to the formation of electrophilic isocyanates, which can result in non-specificity and toxicity. The administration of HDACis leads to increased histone acetylation and relaxation of chromatin structure, thereby inhibiting the progression of ATC tumors Like most tumors, characterized by their rapid division and proliferation, ATC must maintain optimal protein levels. Ribosomes serve as the central hub for this regulation. They are the molecular machines responsible for synthesizing proteins and also recruit numerous enzymes to assist with protein clearance. PARylation is a reversible PTM mediated by the hydrolysis of NAD and the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties to protein acceptors. Poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) utilize NAD by cleaving the ADP-ribosylation moiety and covalently attaching it to specific amino acids in substrate proteins. The PARP family consists of 17 members, each characterized by distinct subcellular localizations, enzymatic activities, and protein substrates [ 153 , 154 ]. The application of deacetylation inhibitors enhances the expression of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, which subsequently activates the caspase family cascade in ATC cells. This activation results in the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7, Leading to the cleavage of poly PARP into an 85 kDa fragment, ultimately resulting in cell cycle arrest in tumors [ 155 ]. PARP-1 is the critical mediator in the base excision repair pathway. A study conducted by Passaro et al. revealed that adenovirus infection induced extensive DNA damage, triggering DNA repair mechanisms in ATC cells. Single-strand breaks (SSBs) that occurred during DNA synthesis were repaired by the SSB repair machinery, which relied on PARP activity [ 156 ]. PARP1 rapidly binds the breaks (~ 1 s), activating the enzyme by opening its NAD binding pocket. Subsequently, PARP1 utilizes NAD to ADP-ribosylate proteins in proximity to DNA breaks, thereby initiating a signaling cascade that facilitates DNA repair [ 157 ]. Inhibiting PARP can enhance adenovirus replication and its oncolytic activity, as well as increase polyploidy and the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase, ultimately leading to ATC cell death [ 156 ]. Moeover, histone PARylation factor 1 (HPF1) plays a crucial role in activating PARP for Ser-ADP ribosylation during the DNA damage response. H3S10 is the primary chromatin target of PARP1/HPF1. In the presence of deacetylase SIRT6, H3K9 acetylation is removed, allowing for the restoration of H3 Ser-ADPr by PARP1/HPF1 on nucleosomes containing H3K9ac. This indicates that H3K9ac can block H3S10 ADP ribosylation [ 158 ]. Consequently, the simultaneous application of HDAC and PARP inhibitors may effectively impede tumorigenesis, thus offering an alternative strategy and elucidating a corresponding molecular mechanism for multi-drug combination therapy in ATC. Glycosylation More than 50% of proteins in humans and animals are glycosylated. Soluble and membrane-bound proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including surface receptors and ligands, secreted proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, and organelle-resident proteins, are constructed and modified with covalent attachment of glycans by the combined action of glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and nucleotide sugar transporters in the ER-Golgi pathway [ 159 ]. There are three main forms of protein glycosylation: [ 1 ] N-glycosylation-(asparagine) [ 2 ], O-glycosylation-(Ser or Thr residues) [ 3 ], proteoglycans (core proteins with addition of long chain sugars). These modifications can affect the biological and physiological properties of proteins, such as folding, half-life, trafficking, cell-cell interactions, and the immune response [ 160 ]. N-glycosylation is a relatively conserved process catalyzed by the Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex located in the ER membrane. The primary role of OST is to incorporate a complex glycan, consisting of N-acetylglucosamine and mannose residues, into the asparagine residue of nascent polypeptides within the ER lumen. The OST complex comprises multiple subunits, including ribonucleotide, STT3, Tusc3/N33, DAD1, MagT1, and ribophorins. Among these, STT3 (STT3A and STT3B) plays a crucial role in N-glycosylation mechanism. Specifically, STT3A is involved in the co-translational modification of nascent peptides, while STT3B is responsible for glycosylating the skipped glycosylation sites in peptides. Inhibition of STT3 within the OST complex adversely affects protein glycosylation, disrupting proper protein folding and contributing to various diseases. In contrast, O-glycosylation typically occurs in high molecular weight proteins within the Golgi complex. Unlike N-glycan synthesis, O-glycan synthesis does not require consensus sequences or dolichol precursors. It is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-V), which adds N-acetylglucosamine residues to the hydroxyl groups of Ser and Thr in wholly folded proteins. Glycosyltransferases then elongate both straight and branched glycan chains by adding monosaccharides, utilizing uridine and guanine triphosphate as cofactors. O-glycosylated mucins are predominantly expressed in various tumor cell types and facilitate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by inducing a range of oncogenic signaling molecules during tumor progression [ 161 ]. It is currently recognized that most cell surface and secreted proteins are glycosylated, and abnormal glycosylation of cancer cell surface proteins can lead to changes in their metastasis and invasion potential, as well as immune escape of the tumor itself and depletion of anti-tumor immune cells, such as CD8 + T cells and NK cells [ 162 ]. Glycosylation in ATC The unique glycosylated protein modifications in ATC cells In a previous study, 313 distinct glycoproteins were identified in PTC, FTC, Hurthle cell carcinoma, and ATC. Within various ATC cell lines (ARO and DRO-1), 43% [ 163 ] and 30% [ 121 ] of the proteins were found to be involved in glycosylation modifications, with 72 glycosylated proteins shared between the two Lines, and 34 and 19 unique glycoproteins identified in ARO and DRO-1 cell lines, respectively. The majority of glycoproteins in ATC were categorized as membrane proteins, secretory proteins, and lysosomal proteins, with a smaller proportion located in the ER/Golgi or other cellular compartments. Notably, the glycosylated membrane proteins CD59 and CD147 were identified as specific biomarkers for ATC [ 164 ]. CD147 is an N-linked glycosylated protein that contains three N-glycosylation sites (N44Q, N152Q, and N186Q). CD147 undergoes preliminary glycosylation in the ER to form an immature high mannose form (LG-CD147). A portion of LG-CD147 is then transported to the Golgi, where it is modified by glycosyltransferases GnT-III, GnT-IV, GnT-V, and FuT-8. This is followed by the translocation of fully glycosylated mature CD147 (HG-CD147) to the plasma membrane, a series of processes that increases its molecular Weight from approximately 27 kDa to 43 ~ 66 kDa. The increase in the HG/LG ratio is closely associated with the occurrence and progression of tumors. Additionally, glycosylated CD147 may stimulate tumor cells to produce MMPs, which are key factors in invasion and metastasis [ 165 ]. It is because transcription factors accumulate in the nuclei of tumor cells, where they activate the expression of GnT-V. Mediated by GnT-V, the global alteration of β1,6-branched glycans on CD147 subsequently binds to integrin β1, ultimately leading to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the induction of EMT [ 166 ]. Meanwhile, β3GnT8 can also promote the expression of MMP2 of tumor cells through enhancing the glycosylation of CD147 [ 167 ]. However, it remains to be further verified whether this mechanism is also applicable to ATC. CD97, a seven-span transmembrane dimeric glycoprotein, is also highly expressed on the surface of ATC compared with normal thyroid tissue and PTC. At the same time, ATC cell lines (SW1736, HTh74 and 8505 C) express CD97 with alternative glycosylation compared to peripheral lymphocytes, while the CD97 antigen presented on C643 cells has glycosylation sites similar to those of lymphocytes. This suggests that CD97 antigen expression may be a potential marker of de-differentiation of lymph nodes and PTC [ 168 ]. However, as in previous experiments, the specific effects of PDGF and CD97 glycosylation on ATC or immune cells have not been elucidated, which requires more follow-up research. On the contrary, some glycosylated proteins may be identified as markers of highly DTC. A study indicated that GnT-V was elevated in PTC and non-poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas, whereas its expression level in ATC was markedly low. This discrepancy arose because GnT-V-mediated glycosylation catalyzed the formation of β−1−6 GlcNAc branches on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, which in turn enhanced the secretion of matriptase and prolonged its half-life, resulting in increased stability [ 169 ]. This finding raised a possibility of whether inducing glycosylation of specific proteins could mitigate the degree of de-differentiation in ATC, thereby altering therapeutic strategies. Heldin et al. discovered that the PDGF receptor in ATC cells could be phosphorylated by the addition of PDGF. Furthermore, the B-PDGF receptor was 5~ 10 kDa larger than that in normal fibroblasts due to glycosylation modification. And the use of endoglycosidase H to remove N-linked carbohydrates eliminated this size disparity. Such variations in receptor size might contribute to the selective growth advantage observed in ATC [ 170 ]. Capsaicin (CAP), a transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) agonist, can restore thyroid-specific gene expression and thereby reverse the de-differentiation of ATC. Meanwhile, CAP also induces a transient calcium influx in ATC cells through TRPV1 channel, triggering rapid intracellular cAMP synthesis and CREB phosphorylation, and ultimately leading to an increased sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) mRNA and protein glycosylation level in ATC cells [ 171 ]. NIS glycosylation: A potential ATC treatment mechanism The NIS is located at the basolateral surface of thyroid follicular cells. NIS facilitates the inward translocation of I − against its electrochemical gradient by coupling it with the inward transport of Na + down its electrochemical gradient [ 172 ]. NIS is a crucial and only pathway for thyroid cells to uptake environmental iodine. A reduction or absence of NIS expression directly results in the failure of radioactive iodine therapy in patients [ 173 ]. Properly assembled and folded NIS is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and subsequently, mediated by ARF4, to the cell membrane through vesicular trafficking. Misfolded intracellular NIS proteins are degraded directly or indirectly via p97/VCP-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways. However, basolateral NIS undergoes internalization through a clathrin-dependent process mediated by PBF. Notably, PBF is a downstream target of the RTK-BRAF signaling pathway. The elevated levels of PBF may lead to enhanced internalization, thereby reducing I − uptake and contributing to the insensitivity of ATC to iodine treatment [ 163 , 174 ]. Since NIS is a glycoprotein with multiple glycosylation sites (Asn225, Asn485, Asn497, etc.), glycosylation modification is essential for NIS function [ 175 ]. NIS is highly glycosylated within the cell membrane, and this glycosylation is crucial for the functional maturation of membrane proteins as well as their translocation across the plasma membrane. The expression of NIS is contingent upon TSH stimulation, which subsequently activates its enhancer region through cAMP. Thus, cAMP plays a significant role in enhancing N-glycosylation capacity. Studies have indicated that glycosylation regulators can modify the quantity of NIS proteins translocated to the membrane. Conversely, glycosylation inhibitors impede protein glycosylation by blocking the formation of N-acetylglucosamine-lipid intermediates, resulting in decreased activity of membrane transport proteins and a reduction in the functionality of the NIS protein itself [ 176 ]. Reyna-Neyra et al. indicated that mutations in SLC5A5 , which encoded the NIS gene, led to the NIS protein being unable to be fully glycosylated in the trans-Golgi. This impairment resulted in inadequate delivery of the protein to the cell surface. Consequently, the partially glycosylated NIS presented in the cell membrane was inactive and could not facilitate I − transport [ 177 ]. However, overexpression of NIS modulates the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby impeding the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway that is responsible for downstream gene transcription and consequently inhibiting the migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells [ 178 ]. Curcumin could enhance NIS glycosylation and its membrane transport function, thereby significantly improving the uptake of radioactive iodine in vitro [ 179 ]. KT5823, a staurosporine-related protein kinase inhibitor, enhanced the Levels of NIS protein in thyroid cells, presenting in two forms: 80 kDa fully glycosylated and 60 kDa low glycosylated. This increase in NIS levels correlates with a rise in radioactive iodide uptake in thyroid cells [ 180 ]. Choi et al. found that ATC cells treated with Tunicamycin, an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, could promote NIS expression, and inhibit pERK1/2 phosphorylation and glucose transport and uptake. Hence, enhancing NIS expression and mature glycosylation modifications restored radioiodine avidity of ATC, thereby providing an effective treatment [ 181 ]. Furthermore, a previous study revealed that the missing of residues 439 ~ 443 in the sixth intracellular loop resulted in incomplete glycosylation of NIS, causing it to remain in intracellular compartments prior to the medial-Golgi and preventing its transport to the plasma membrane. The insertion of five alanine residues at the deletion site partially restored the plasma membrane targeting function. Furthermore, the restoration of Asn at position 441 allowed its side chain to interact with the main chain amino group of G444, which nearly fully recovered NIS targeting to the cell surface and restored 95% of the I − transport function [ 182 ]. This suggests that glycosylation at different amino acid sites may independently or jointly influence NIS intracellular transport and membranal iodide transport. Therefore, the impact of NIS glycosylation on ATC should be considered from both of these perspectives (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 NIS glycosylation process in thyroid cells. TSH stimulates the accumulation of cAMP in thyroid cells via TSHR. The increase in cAMP can enhance the transcription of SLC5A5 , which encodes NIS. Subsequently, the newly synthesized amino acid oligosaccharide chain is initially processed in the ER and then transferred to the N-glycosylation site of the nascent peptide chain through OST. The attached polypeptide chain undergoes further processing and modification in the Golgi apparatus, resulting in the formation of three types of N-glycans: oligomannose, hybrid, and complex. However, the specific type of N-glycan produced by NIS in the Golgi remains undetermined. Ultimately, the mature NIS is transported to the cell membrane, where it features multiple glycosylation sites, including N225, 485, 489, 497, and 502 The “missing area” of PTMs in ATC Neglected PTM diversity in ATC Upon reviewing all the relevant studies, we found that some PTMs in ATC exhibited little to no involvement, such as lipidation and methylation. Lipids represent a complex and diverse group of biological molecules that are essential for membrane stability, signal transduction, and energy production. Rapidly proliferating cancer cells necessitate a continuous supply of lipids to support cellular growth and adapt to their environment [ 183 ]. The synthesis of lipids is activated in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. First, under the catalysis of ACC, cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA is converted into malonyl-CoA. Subsequently, through the action of FASN, malonyl-CoA is continuously added, leading to the elongation of the carbon chain by two carbon units until palmitate is produced. Following this, palmitate undergoes desaturation via SCD1 or FADS2, resulting in the formation of polyunsaturated FAs (fatty acids) [ 184 ]. The type and saturation of FAs in the membrane affect its structural stability and function. SFA play a crucial role in maintaining membrane fluidity and facilitating selective transmembrane transport. Conversely, PUFA are highly susceptible to ROS, which can lead to lipid peroxidation and increase cellular vulnerability to ferroptosis. In contrast, the peroxidation of MUFA serves a protective function. Consequently, tumor cell membranes are characterized by an elevated ratio of MUFA/SFA and MUFA/UFA. The SCD is pivotal in regulating the type and saturation of FAs within the membrane. Its inhibition results in a decreased MUFA/SFA ratio, thereby promoting the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells. Therefore, ACC, FASN, and SCD1 are frequently upregulated in various cancer types, supporting numerous cellular functions, including membrane biosynthesis, activation of oncogenic signaling pathways, protein acylation, and evasion of apoptosis [ 185 ]. Only one previous study focused on the lipidation of ATC. Compared to normal thyroid tissue, ATC exhibited an increased demand for lipid availability, resulting in enhanced fatty acid synthesis, which included key enzymes such as ACC, FASN, SCD1 and SCD5. Additionally, various proteins involved in fatty acid uptake, transport, and metabolism were upregulated, including FABP and SLC27A proteins. Among these, SCD1 played a crucial role in the survival and proliferation of ATC cells. Moreover, SCD1 inhibitors could induce ER stress, activate the unfolded protein response, and trigger apoptosis [ 186 ]. Although the specific mechanism remains inadequately defined, subsequent studies on other tumors have elucidated potential causes. SCD1 plays a crucial role in maintaining membrane fluidity, thereby alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress under adverse conditions. Inhibition of SCD1 disrupts the mitochondrial electron transport chain and diminishes the binding of MUFA to cardiolipin, resulting in increased intracellular ROS production and the induction of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis [ 187 ]. Concurrently, SCD1 inhibition reduces the MUFA to UFA ratio in the membrane, and given that MUFA possesses anti-peroxidation properties, this shift promotes ferroptosis [ 188 ]. Inhibition of SCD1/FADS2 also directly downregulates critical enzymes and proteins in the ferroptosis-related antioxidant defense system, including GPX4 and GSH. This disruption of cellular and mitochondrial redox homeostasis results in iron-mediated lipid peroxidation, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 189 ]. The limited research on ATC lipidation may stem from the current challenges in identifying specific lipid metabolic pathways associated with ATC, particularly when compared to other types of thyroid tumors. Wojakowska et al. indicated that the levels of SFA were downregulated in patients with PTC, FTC, MTC, and ATC compared to normal thyroid tissue [ 190 ]. One of the enzymes in the CYP450 family, which is also involved in lipid metabolism, plays a significant role in ATC and DTC. Specifically, AMPK inhibited ACC, resulting in a decrease in malonyl-CoA levels and subsequently promoting β-oxidation [ 191 ]. Furthermore, another study demonstrated that ACLY served as a crucial enzyme in FA synthesis, with ACLY expression being upregulated in ATC compared to normal thyroid tissue and DTC. Notably, ACLY inhibitors suppressed the proliferation of both DTC and ATC, although the underlying mechanisms remained unclear [ 192 ]. Given the heterogeneity of ATC and thyroid tumors, identifying specific key lipid modification pathways remains a critical issue to be addressed in future research. Similarly, only one study elucidated the role of histone methylation in ATC. The growth of ATC cells was significantly influenced by the expression of the histone lysine methyltransferase ASH1L. ASH1L knockout substantially reduced H3K36me2 levels, particularly impacting the H3K36me2 modification of the lncCCAT1. The downregulation of CCAT1 expression could partially inhibit the cell growth-promoting effects mediated by ASH1L. Simultaneously, the abundance of the ASH1L protein was post-translationally regulated by miR-200b , with overexpression of miR-200b Leading to a 50% reduction in ASH1L protein levels [ 193 ]. However, it is important to note that not all methyltransferases are highly expressed in ATC. For instance, a previous study indicated that N-methyltransferase was highly expressed in PTC but was essentially not expressed in ATC [ 194 ]. Current studies on the methylation status of thyroid cancer primarily focus on well-differentiated thyroid cancers, with PTC being the most prevalent. Although a few investigations have examined the methylation status in PDTC and ATC, the incidence of alterations is generally higher in these cancers compared to DTC. Specifically, PDTC and ATC exhibit a hypomethylation pattern in 93.8% of cases, in contrast to 3.6% in low-risk well-differentiated cancers and 42.4% in metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancers. Consequently, while distant metastatic DTC, PDTC, and ATC all demonstrate overall hypomethylation, their utility in providing informative insights is limited, and no effective methylation biomarkers for ATC have been identified [ 195 , 196 ]. Lastly, research on other types of PTMs is absent in ATC, including S-nitrosylation and sulfation. These modifications may also play critical roles in ATC. Unraveling complex regulatory networks in ATC Research on the co-regulation of ATC by various modification types is relatively scarce, with most studies focusing on one single PTM. However, the development of ATC is characterized by the joint regulation of multiple modification types, indicating that a simplistic regulatory mechanism cannot adequately capture the complexities of ATC progression and signaling cascades. This complex regulatory network is also a significant factor contributing to the development of drug resistance [ 197 ]. SKP2, a critical substrate-recognition component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, mediates ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. PHLPP1, a member of the PH domain-leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase family, has been identified as one such substrate in thyroid cancer. Notably, a recent study revealed that SKP2 directly interacted with PHLPP1, promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This SKP2-PHLPP1 axis resulted in constitutive Akt activation and suppression of autophagy, thereby driving tumor progression [ 198 ]. As previously mentioned, YAP/TAZ is regulated not only by the classical Hippo signaling pathway, and recent studies have also identified non-Hippo-dependent regulatory mechanisms for its activity. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway serves as an alternative route that regulates YAP/TAZ independently of the Hippo pathway. Upon Wnt activation, β-catenin can bind to TAZ, leading to their ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. Conversely, the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway inhibits the degradation of TAZ, facilitating its translocation into the nucleus and enhancing its transcriptional activation capabilities [ 199 ]. Notably, YAP/TAZ is regulated not only by phosphorylation and ubiquitination but also by multiple PTMs in a coordinated manner. Li et al. demonstrated that in thyroid cancer, O-GlcNAcylation mediated by OGT targets YAP at Ser109, which inhibited its phosphorylation, enhanced protein stability, and facilitated nuclear translocation. Furthermore, this glycosylation modification disrupted the LATS1-YAP interaction, leading to dephosphorylation of YAP at Ser127 and subsequent activation, ultimately driving malignant cellular phenotypes [ 200 ]. A recent study conducted by Ma et al. revealed that non-coding RNA, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination co-regulated ATC. LINC00886 expression was reduced in ATC compared to PTC. The downregulation of LINC00886 resulted in a decrease in protein kinase R (PKR) levels, as LINC00886 physically interacts with PKR and influences its stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation pathway in ATC. This downregulation of PKR enhanced the activity of eIF2α by reducing its phosphorylation, thereby promoting protein synthesis and contributing to the maintenance of malignancy in ATC [ 201 ]. The transcription factor HOXD9 negatively regulates miR-451a by directly binding to its promoter region, which can directly target PSMB8 to activate the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote the malignant progression of ATC [ 202 ]. This also leads to a second issue. We find that most studies primarily describe changes in the phenomenon of PTMs, such as alterations in the expression of PTM-modifying enzymes and the activation and deactivation of associated pathways, yet they often neglect to address the intrinsic molecular mechanisms involved. In addition to the dysregulation of gene transcription and PTMs, abnormal translation from mRNA to protein significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of various cancers. The m6A regulators in cancer can be modulated through several epigenetic modifications, including ubiquitination, SUMOylation, acetylation, lactylation, O-GlcNAcylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ISGylation [ 134 ]. Translation can be categorized into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. The formation of the translation initiation complex (eIF4F) is a critical process in this context. The eIF4F complex comprises three components: eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. In tumors with BRAF mutations, the upregulation of the eIF4F complex contributes to resistance against BRAF-targeted therapies and facilitates increased metastasis. Inhibiting the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, or targeting the suppression of eIF4A, can enhance the efficacy of BRAF-targeted treatments. The m6A reader, IGF2BP3, promotes eIF4E-mediated translational activation by degrading mRNA of eIF4E-BP2, which acts as a negative regulator of eIF4E. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of eIF4E further enhances protein translation, ultimately resulting in tumor cell proliferation [ 203 ]. As mentioned previously, the dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is implicated in the progression of various tumors. Among these, TCF/LEF serves as the primary endpoint of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, regulating the expression of target genes through its β-catenin and DNA-binding domains. METTL3 facilitates the m6A methylation of TCF in thyroid cancer. Additionally, TCF has been shown to enhance the stability of METTL14 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation [ 204 ]. This presents a promising avenue for further investigation, which could yield valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies. Developing more PTM-based drugs As previously mentioned, this review indicates that most traditional drugs used in the treatment of ATC are related to phosphorylation and acetylation. However, there is a need for the discovery of new targeted inhibitors. Oh et al. developed a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CTOM-DHP, which significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of BRAF and Akt. This inhibition restored the expression of thyroid-specific genes, including PAX8 , TPO , TG , and TSHR . Furthermore, CTOM-DHP enhanced the promoter activity of intracellular NIS , subsequently increasing its expression in both the cytoplasm and cell membrane. As a result, this restoration facilitated I − uptake by ATC cells, thereby improving sensitivity to radioactive iodine therapy [ 205 ]. On the other side, there is a pressing need for the development of additional drugs that target other types of PTMs, either directly or indirectly. For example, lovastatin inhibits the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of isoprenoid metabolites in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Isoprenoid intermediates, as lipid moieties, facilitate PTMs of numerous proteins. Lovastatin enhances the formation of the CDK2-p27 complex in ATC cells, reduces CDK2 activity, and lowers the protein levels of cyclin A2, cyclin D3, and phosphorylated Rb, thereby inhibiting ATC proliferation. The underlying mechanism involves lovastatin’s ability to diminish Rho geranylgeranylation by depleting mevalonate and its downstream isoprene metabolite GGPP in ATC cells. This reduction leads to a blockade of membrane translocation, which in turn increases the expression and stability of p27 and induces cell growth arrest [ 206 ]. Interestingly, the combined use of lovastatin and paclitaxel does not yield a superior additive effect. Rather, it results in an antagonistic effect, which is less effective than the apoptotic effect produced by each drug individually on ATC [ 207 ]. And Altmann et al. found that Bortezomib, a broadly acting proteasome inhibitor, could activate the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by inducing increased transcription of the ubiquitin-binding enzyme E2H and ubiquitin proteases, thereby promoting apoptosis of ATC [ 208 ]. Low-dose Bortezomib also enhances the expression of TRAIL receptors, p21 WAF1/CIP1 , and caspase-3/7 through post-transcriptional regulation, while simultaneously reducing the levels of anti-apoptotic mediators such as FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein, Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and c-IAP1. This modulation ultimately induces cell death via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [ 209 ]. Several small molecule inhibitors of specific cellular glycosylation have not been applied in ATC. These inhibitors can block the specific glycosylation of unique protein targets or distinct pools of glycoproteins in tumor cells [ 210 ]. Consequently, there remains an urgent need to develop multi-targeting therapeutic agents, which may significantly improve clinical outcomes for ATC patients. Conclusions Overall, ATC remains one of the most lethal and treatment-refractory malignancies to date. ATC progression is regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways which is controlled by the coordinated action of various PTMs (Fig. 8 ). During ATC development, multiple PTMs or identical PTMs at distinct sites frequently occur on key substrates. During ATC pathogenesis, multiple or identical PTMs at distinct sites frequently co-occur on key substrate proteins. These modifications may arise either simultaneously or sequentially, critically determining divergent signaling outcomes in the cascade. Currently, most PTM-based targeted therapies for ATC are designed against single molecular targets, inevitably leading to drug resistance. A deeper understanding of PTM crosstalk mechanisms is therefore essential for developing multi-target inhibitors. Moreover, the identification of ATC-specific PTMs and their resultant proteoforms can provide crucial insights into altered protein/enzyme functions and molecular pathways, potentially yielding novel diagnostic biomarkers. Notably, biomarker discovery should integrate multi-omics data—including transcriptomics and metabolomics—alongside proteomics and its variants, rather than relying solely on protein-level analyses. With the rapid advancements in proteomics and the increasing application of artificial intelligence in the medical field, such as AlphaFold3, which accurately predicts protein structures and interactions, the identification of potential PTM sites and development of corresponding therapeutics have become more feasible than ever. However, rigorous cell biological validation remains imperative, as not all protein modifications functionally contribute to ATC proliferation, metastasis, or immune evasion of malignant cells. Furthermore, the role of PTMs in conjunction with other regulatory mechanisms in ATC requires further investigation, as this will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying combined treatment strategies. The ultimate objective is to enable more patients to benefit from these advancements and to improve their prognosis. Fig. 8 The core mechanisms of PTMs regulating ATC progression.

  "plain_text": "Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains one of the most lethal tumors, exhibiting a high recurrence rate, mortality rate and resistance to treatment. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) influence protein function by altering protein structure and play a crucial role in key signal transduction events related to tumor transformation and carcinogenesis, mainly including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and glycosylation. We highlight that dysregulation of PTM-mediated cascades in core proteins or signaling pathways serves as key factors in ATC progression. Phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, along with the activation of various pathways, are associated with the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of ATC. The first two PTMs significantly contribute to both targeted drug synthesis and the development of treatment resistance. Additionally, glycosylation is linked to the de-differentiation of ATC and offers an approach for new therapeutic strategies. Moreover, we discuss the potential of PTMs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ATC. Different PTMs play a crucial role in the application of various therapeutic approaches, particularly in the context of targeted drugs. These modifications underlie the molecular mechanisms for the selection of corresponding drugs and contribute to resistance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes by which multiple PTMs co-regulate ATC by exploring the interplay of PTMs and their impact on ATC progression. Besides, there are still some gaps and unresolved issues in this field. By integrating different insights, we emphasize the progress in tools for early intervention to improve the prognosis of patients with ATC."
