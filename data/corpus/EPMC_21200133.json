  "title": "Ligation of CD40 receptor in human B lymphocytes triggers the 5-lipoxygenase pathway to produce reactive oxygen species and activate p38 MAPK.",

  "abstract_text": "Previously, we reported that CD40-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidase requires the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 3, as well as the activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Rac1. Here we investigated the possible mechanisms of the production of ROS after CD40 ligation in B cells. We describe an alternative ROS production pathway that is triggered by CD40 ligation, involves 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), and results in activation of p38 MAPK. Our studies in Raji human B lymphomas revealed that CD40-induced ROS production by 5-LO also requires the activities of PI3K and Rac1. In contrast to the NADPH oxidase pathway, however, TRAF molecules are not required for the CD40-induced ROS production by 5-LO. The association of CD40 with 5-LO is dependent on CD40 ligation in Raji B cells, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments using epitope- tagged proteins transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells revealed the role of the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, in this association. Collectively, these data suggest a separate pathway for the CD40-induced ROS production in B cells and demonstrate that this pathway requires 5-LO via direct association of p85 with both CD40 and 5-LO.",
