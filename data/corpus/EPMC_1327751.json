  "abstract_text": "Primary human papillomavirus (HPV) positive anogenital cancers normally develop without somatic mutation within the p53 gene. In this study, however, we have identified p53 point mutations in metastases arising from HPV positive cervical carcinomas, suggesting that acquisition of p53 mutation may play a role in the progression of some HPV associated primary cancers. p53 mutants identified in anogenital cancers exhibit a dominant transforming phenotype and increased resistance to HPV16 E6 directed degradation. The association of p53 mutation with metastases may explain the poor prognosis reported for HPV negative primary cancers, many of which already contain mutant p53. A high proportion of p53 mutations detected in both primary and metastatic cancers are GC-->TA transversions, strongly suggesting a role for external carcinogens in the development of these cancers.",
