    "abstract_text": "Loci linked to sensitivity to dietary obesity were identified by Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis of two mapping populations derived from a cross between AKR/J and SWR/J mice. AKR/J mice are sensitive to dietary obesity when fed a high fat diet while SWR/J mice are resistant. Intercrosses between these strains segregate the phenotype of sensitivity to dietary obesity. Using an F2 mapping population of 931 male mice we found significant linkage with a QTL on chromosome 9 (Likelihood of the Odds [LOD] ratio of 4.85) and another QTL on chromosome 15 (LOD = 3.93). The presence of a QTL on chromosome 15 was confirmed in a separate mapping population of 375 male F1 x SWR/J mice (LOD = 3.82). These two loci are designated dietary obese 2 (Do2) and dietary obese 3 (Do3) for the chromosome 9 and 15 loci, respectively. Both of these chromosomal regions contain candidate genes which may contribute to variation in the phenotype. These loci also exert a significant control over individual adipose depot weights.",
