  "abstract_text": "Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) mediate cell proliferation, differentiation and survival in immune responses, hematopoiesis, neurogenesis and other biological processes. STAT3, for example, is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition during gastrulation, organogenesis, wound healing and cancer progression. STAT activity is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including nuclear translocation. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of STAT activity, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. Here, we identified binder of ADP-ribosylation factor-like two (BART) as a novel STAT-binding partner. Importantly, we showed that BART is essential for the transcriptional activity and nuclear retention of STAT3. Furthermore, an effector of BART, ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (ARL2) was also involved in nuclear retention of STAT3. These results indicate that BART plays an essential role in the nuclear retention of STAT3 through interaction with ARL2.",
