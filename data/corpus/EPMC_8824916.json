    "abstract_text": "There are several cell types within the placenta that produce cytokines which can contribute to the regulatory mechanisms that ensure normal pregnancy. The immunological milieu at the maternofetal interface is considered to be crucial for survival of the fetus. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast, the cell layer between the mother and the fetus. IL-2 appears to be a key factor in maintenance of pregnancy. Therefore, it was important to determine the sequence of human placental interleukin-2. Direct sequencing of human placental IL-2 cDNA was determined for the coding region. Subclone sequencing was carried out for the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR and 3'-UTR). The 5'-UTR for human placental IL-2 cDNA is 294 bp, which is 247 nucleotides longer than that reported for cDNA IL-2 derived from T cells. The sequence of the coding region is identical to that reported for T cell IL-2, while sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product showed that the cDNA from the 3' end was the same as that reported for cDNA from T cells. Human placental IL-2 cDNA is 1,028 base pairs (excluding the poly A tail), which is 247 bp longer at the 5' end than that reported for IL-2 T cell cDNA. Therefore, the extended 5'-UTR of the placental IL-2 cDNA may be a consequence of alternative promoter utilization in the placenta.",
