  "abstract_text": "Malignant glioma is a consistently fatal brain cancer. The tumor invades the surrounding tissue, limiting complete surgical removal and thereby initiating recurrence. Identifying molecules critical for glioma invasion is essential to develop targeted, effective therapies. The expression of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) increases in malignant glioma and AEG-1 regulates in vitro invasion and migration of malignant glioma cells by activating the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. The present studies elucidate the domains of AEG-1 important for mediating its function. Serial NH(2)-terminal and COOH-terminal deletion mutants were constructed and functional analysis revealed that the NH(2)-terminal 71 amino acids were essential for invasion, migration, and NF-kappaB-activating properties of AEG-1. The p65-interaction domain was identified between amino acids 101 to 205, indicating that p65 interaction alone is not sufficient to mediate AEG-1 function. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that AEG-1 interacts with cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP), indicating that it might act as a bridging factor between NF-kappaB, CBP, and the basal transcription machinery. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that AEG-1 is associated with the NF-kappaB binding element in the interleukin-8 promoter. Thus, AEG-1 might function as a coactivator for NF-kappaB, consequently augmenting expression of genes necessary for invasion of glioma cells. In these contexts, AEG-1 represents a viable potential target for the therapy of malignant glioma.",
