Keywords Essential thrombocythemia Myeloproliterative neoplasms Inflammation Bibliometric analysis CiteSpace VOSviewer Research trends NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA 82074240 82074240 82074240 82074240 Pan Yiming Hou Li Lang Haiyan Yan Jun Chinese Society of Traditional Chinese Medicine Project \u2013 Basic Research on Dominant Diseases in Hematology 202169-004 202169-004 Pan Yiming Lang Haiyan issue-copyright-statement \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by abnormal proliferation of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, persistent elevation of platelets in peripheral blood, and a significantly increased risk of thrombosis [ 1 ]. In 1934, Emil Epstein and Alfred Goedel first described the clinical features of ET [ 2 ]. In 1951, William Dameshek introduced the concept of myeloproliferative disorders, classifying ET as one of them [ 3 ]. Subsequent research by hematologists confirmed that myeloproliferative disorders originate as malignant neoplasms at the level of hematopoietic stem cells [ 4 \u2013 6 ]. The discovery of the Janus Kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) V617F mutation in 2005 and its confirmation as a driver of myeloproliferative neoplasms marked a significant milestone [ 7 ]. This discovery reshaped the scientific understanding of ET mechanisms, greatly advancing research and shifting ET diagnosis from clinical morphology to molecular biology [ 8 ]. Later, the identification of Calreticulin ( CALR ) and Myeloproliferative Leukemia Virus Oncogene ( MPL ) mutations as additional drivers in ET filled the gap in molecular diagnosis for JAK2 -negative patients [ 9 ]. These discoveries have laid a solid foundation for subsequent clinical diagnostics and therapeutic explorations. Despite significant progress, ET research is far from complete, with several critical issues yet to be resolved. The mechanisms underlying ET progression to myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia remain unclear, and targeted therapies have not fully met expectations in halting disease progression [ 10 ]. The marked heterogeneity among ET patients presents a major challenge to precision and personalized medicine [ 11 ]. Compared to current clinical needs, the best available treatment options still fall short in controlling complications and disease progression, underscoring the urgent need for new drugs and therapies [ 12 ]. While significant obstacles have been overcome, the summit remains distant, and now is an opportune moment to reflect on past progress and look toward the future to better guide upcoming research directions. Bibliometrics, through quantitative analysis and visualization techniques, can reveal the impact of research outcomes and collaboration networks among researchers, highlighting trends and emerging hotspots in the field [ 13 ]. In the medical field, bibliometrics has been widely applied to research on cardiovascular diseases [ 14 ], neurological disorders [ 15 ], autoimmune diseases [ 16 ], and cancer [ 17 ]. With its advantages in visualization and data-driven insights, bibliometrics helps researchers and clinicians quickly grasp the latest research trends, identify key studies and experts, and assist in clinical decision-making and research planning [ 18 ]. However, bibliometric studies on ET remain scarce. Therefore, this study provides a bibliometric analysis and review of ET literature published over the past two decades. Method Search strategy and data acquisition The Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) is one of the most widely used databases for bibliometric research, offering significant advantages in terms of data quality, temporal coverage, scope, and standardization. We selected \"Essential Thrombocytosis\" or \"Essential Thrombocythemia\" as the search keywords, focusing on English-language literature indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED). The search was limited to articles and reviews, excluding abstracts, letters, conference papers, and other types of publications. To ensure the completeness and accuracy of the results, two authors independently conducted searches in the WoSCC on September 20, 2024, covering the time span from January 1, 2001, to July 30, 2024. Any discrepancies in the search results were resolved through detailed discussions among all authors. The retrieved research papers were downloaded on the same day in.txt format, including \"Full Record and Cited References,\" for further analysis. Data analysis In this study, we utilized three bibliometric tools: CiteSpace 6.4.R1, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix. CiteSpace 6.4, developed by Professor Chaomei Chen [ 19 ], is a bibliometric tool with capabilities for dual-overlay journal analysis, keyword timeline analysis, and burst detection. It excels at illustrating the structural development of a discipline, thematic evolution, and research frontiers. We used CiteSpace for citation burst analysis, keyword burst analysis, journal map analysis, and keyword timeline analysis. In CiteSpace\u2019s burst detection, red lines indicate the time span of a citation burst, with terms arranged in chronological order. In the keyword timeline analysis, the solid portion of each bar represents the rise and fall of different themes, with the keywords above the bars showing hot topics during specific periods, and the labels on the right marking the thematic clusters. VOSviewer is another commonly used bibliometric tool [ 20 ], known for its excellent capabilities in visualizing network structures. It also supports overlay analysis to show changes in research over time. We used VOSviewer to analyze the academic contributions and network relationships of countries/regions, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords. In VOSviewer\u2019s network analysis, node size represents the publication volume, citation frequency, or occurrence frequency, node color indicates different clusters, and lines between nodes represent citation or co-occurrence relationships. Bibliometrix is a bibliometric tool based on the R language [ 21 ], featuring geographical data visualization and the calculation of local author impact factors. In the analysis of countries and regions, \"Taiwan\" was categorized as part of China. In the keyword analysis, synonyms were merged, for example \"myeloproliferative neoplasm\" with \"myeloproliferative neoplasms,\" \"Essential Thrombocytosis\" with \"Essential Thrombocythemia,\" and \"JAK2\" with \"Tyrosine Kinase JAK2.\" Results Publication and citation trends Searching the Web of Science database with the topic \"Essential Thrombocythemia (ET)\" yielded 4,394 publications. After screening for duplicates, no redundant documents were identified. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, excluding 65 conference abstracts, 17 preprints, 14 book chapters, and 1 retracted article. Ultimately, 4,297 publications were included for analysis, consisting of 3,373 research articles (78.50%) and 924 reviews (21.50%). The main descriptive information was detailed in Table 1 . These studies were published in 778 journals and authored by 17,758 researchers from 4,093 institutions across 84 countries or regions. Figure 1 shows the trends in ET-related publications and citations from 2001 to 2024. In 2001, 65 publications were recorded, followed by a steady increase, peaking at 281 in 2020. Although the annual output declined slightly thereafter, 239 publications were still recorded in 2023. Excluding 2024 data, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ET publications from 2001 to 2023 was 6.14%. Table 1 Main information of the included publications Description Results Main information Timespan 2001:2024 Journals 778 Documents 4297 Compound annual growth rate % 6.14 Document average age 9.51 Average citations per document 39.24 References 66,232 Document contents Keywords plus 4536 Author\u2019s keywords 4642 AUTHORS Authors 16,781 Authors Of single-authored docs 157 Single-authored docs 256 Co-authors per doc 7.85 International co-authorships % 21.67 Document types Article 3373 Review 924 Fig. 1 Annual publications and citations in ET Research Country/region contributions and collaboration networks The analysis of publication volume and citation counts by country and region (Table 2 ) shows that the United States leads in both publications and citations, followed by Italy, China, Germany, England, and France. While European countries publish fewer articles, they outperform the U.S. in average citations per article, with Italy, Germany, the UK, and France all surpassing the U.S. average of 58.90. In contrast, China and Japan have increased publication volume but continue to underperform in citations. The co-authorship analysis (Fig. 2 ) shows that the U.S. holds a dominant position in global collaboration, with strong ties to Europe, China, Japan, and Canada. European nations act as major research hubs, with strong regional cooperation and partnerships extending to the Americas, Asia, and Oceania. In contrast, Asian countries remain more peripheral. The time-overlay analysis (Fig. 3 ) reveals that from 2001 to 2010, the U.S. and European nations led global ET research, with collaborations primarily centered between these regions. After 2013, Asian countries, particularly China and Japan, significantly expanded partnerships with the West, enhancing their global research standing. As shown in Fig. 4 , Western countries have historically dominated ET research due to their established collaboration networks. However, the rise of Asia has injected new momentum into international scientific cooperation, further globalizing ET research.

The Mayo Clinic has produced the most publications and ranks first in total citations. It also preponderates in average citations and total link strength. From 2012 to 2020, the Mayo Clinic maintained active international collaborations with European and American institutions, reinforcing its prominence in the field. Similarly, the University of Florence serves as a hub in the network, with the highest total link strength and the second-highest publications. It collaborates closely with other Italian institutions, such as the University of Pavia and Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo, forming a dense regional cluster within Europe. The University also plays a critical role in connecting European institutions to international partners, contributing significantly to the globalization of ET research. Since 2018, several emerging research collaborations have gained attention (Fig. 6 ). Institutions such as Harvard Medical School, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Zealand University Hospital have rapidly expanded their networks, reflecting a clear growth trend.

Despite publishing only 17 articles, NEJM has amassed 12,818 citations, resulting in an extraordinary average of 754 citations per article, solidifying its status as another vital node in the co-citation network. Leukemia, American Journal of Hematology, British Journal of Haematology, and Journal of Clinical Oncology have also made significant contributions, both in terms of publications and citations, forming a core group for ET research dissemination. The dual-map overlay of journals (Fig. 8 ) visually depicts the flow of knowledge from foundational research to cutting-edge advancements, revealing the macrostructure of the discipline's development. \"Molecular, Biology, and Genetics\" serves as the primary knowledge base, with \"Health, Nursing, and Medicine\" acting as the second-largest repository. Research from these areas, along with contributions from other fields, converges into the \"Molecular, Biology, Immunology\" and \"Medicine, Medical, Clinical\" domains, representing the forefront of knowledge. This illustrates that ET research is built on a robust foundation of molecular biology, immunology, and clinical medicine, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field.

Vannucchi has also made notable contributions, particularly in molecular diagnostics [ 33 ], the clinical application of ruxolitinib [ 27 ], and managing ET-related complications [ 34 ]. With 177 publications and 18,735 citations, Vannucchi\u2019s Total Link Strength of 915 highlights his collaborative impact. His prominent position in the co-citation network shows his work\u2019s global reach. Other leading researchers, including Srdan Verstovsek, Tiziano Barbui, and Ruben Mesa, have each published over 100 papers with significant citation counts, advancing ET research. The co-authorship network (Fig. 10 ) reveals strong collaboration clusters, especially among Italian researchers like Vannucchi, Barbui, and Guglielmelli, who work closely with both European and North American teams. Tefferi and colleagues at Mayo Clinic form a distinct North American cluster with collaborations extending to Europe. Similarly, Srdan Verstovsek leads a U.S. cluster collaborating with researchers from the UK and Italy. Hans Carl Hasselbalch, though working more independently from mainstream European and North American clusters, has established a unique influence within ET research from Denmark. Fig. 10 Visualization of author co-citation network Document contributions and citation analysis Among the most highly cited references (Table 6 ), Arber (2016) [ 35 ] and Khoury (2022) [ 36 ] are the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification guidelines, while the remaining studies largely focus on driver gene research. These include Kralovics (2005) [ 26 ], Baxter (2005) [ 37 ], Levine (2005) [ 30 , 30 ], Khoury (2022) [ 36 ], Klampfl (2013) [ 38 ], Harrison (2012) [ 27 ], Nangalia (2013) [ 39 ], Pikman (2006) [ 40 ], and Scott (2007) [ 28 ], with most of these studies related to driver mutations. Arber (2016) [ 35 ] incorporated advancements in genetics and molecular biology into the WHO classification, establishing more refined diagnostic criteria for myeloid malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Kralovics (2005) [ 26 ] demonstrated that the JAK2 V617F mutation is an acquired mutation that confers a proliferative and survival advantage to hematopoietic cells, with patients harboring this mutation showing a higher incidence of complications. Baxter (2005) [ 37 ] was the first to report the widespread presence of JAK2 mutations in MPN patients, suggesting it as a key pathogenic factor. Levine (2005) [ 30 ] also discovered the broad prevalence of JAK2 V617F in MPN patients, experimentally demonstrating that this mutation enables hematopoietic cells to proliferate independently of hematopoietic factors, making them highly sensitive to hematopoietic growth factors. Khoury (2022) [ 36 ] updated the diagnostic criteria, incorporating mutations such as JAK2 V617F, CALR , and MPL , further refining the diagnostic system for MPNs.

Scott University of Cambridge, UK The New England Journal of Medicine Through citation burst analysis (Fig. 11 ), it was found that high citation burst articles largely overlapped with highly cited papers, indicating that these publications were not only hot topics at the time but also laid the groundwork for new research directions, providing a solid knowledge base for sustained active research. The top five articles with the highest burst indices were Arber (2016) [ 35 ], Baxter (2005) [ 37 ], Kralovics (2005) [ 26 ], Klampfl (2013) [ 38 ], and James (2005) [ 41 ]. James (2005) [ 41 ] was the first to report the clonal JAK2 V617F mutation in MPNs. More recent burst articles include Barbui (2018) [ 42 ] and Grinfeld (2018) [ 43 ]. Barbui (2018) [ 42 ] updated treatment recommendations for Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-neg MPNs), emphasizing the diagnostic value of non-driver genes and proposing more precise stratified treatment strategies. Based on genomic sequencing, Grinfeld (2018) [ 43 ] introduced a more accurate and personalized classification method and prognostic assessment system. Fig. 11 The top 25 references with strongest citation bursts Citation network analysis reveals the importance of specific articles and the pathways of knowledge dissemination in the research field, helping to identify foundational studies. Co-citation analysis, which focuses on the similarity and complementarity between studies, helps to identify the knowledge base and thematic evolution within the field. From the citation network diagram (Fig. 12 ) and the temporal overlay map (Fig. 13 ), it is evident that Kralovics (2005) [ 26 ], Baxter (2005) [ 37 ], and Levine (2005) [ 30 ] occupy central upstream positions in the citation network, receiving extensive citations. Later papers, such as Pikman (2006) [ 40 ], Klampfl (2013) [ 38 ], and Nangalia (2013) [ 39 ], gradually converged, culminating in Arber (2016) [ 35 ], which drove the revision and update of the guidelines. The co-citation network analysis (Fig. 14 ) demonstrates that mutation-driven research, including Kralovics (2005) [ 26 ], Baxter (2005) [ 37 ], Levine (2005) [ 30 ], and James (2005) [ 41 ], forms a major cluster at the hub of the network, extending into a yellow cluster including Klampfl (2013) [ 38 ] and Vainchenker (2017) [ 44 ] that focuses on mutations and molecular mechanisms, a blue cluster including Verstovsek (2012) [ 45 ] and Harrison [ 27 ] surrounding clinical trials and the use of JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib, and a red cluster including Vannucchi (2015) [ 46 ] and Barbui (2011) [ 47 ] addressing the treatment and clinical management of ET.

It is evident that research themes such as thrombosis and antithrombotic therapy, myelofibrosis, gene mutations and pathogenesis, disease transformation, and chronic inflammation have remained active over time, with no sign of declining research interest. The distribution of thematic keywords along the timeline is relatively even, with no significant increase or decrease in trends. The \u201cgenome-wide association\u201d research theme appears later than others, indicating that it is a relatively recent area of interest. Fig. 17 Timeline visualization of high-frequency keywords from 2001 to 2024 By observing the keyword burst analysis (Fig. 18 ), we can see that there has been a significant shift in research focus around the JAK2 V617F mutation.

Despite the wealth of ET-related studies, there remains a shortage of bibliometric analyses focusing on the visualization of this field. This study, for the first time, employs bibliometric methods to comprehensively visualize research contributions, collaboration networks, key studies, and future trends in the ET domain. Building on the strong research foundation in the ET field, Europe and the United States have emerged as the largest global scientific hubs, unquestionably serving as central centers for ET research collaboration. Their tightly-knit networks have consistently driven advancements in ET research. Although global inter-regional collaborations have intensified in recent years, this landscape has remained largely unchanged. Emerging scientific powers such as China and Japan have demonstrated robust publication output, but their average citation rates remain low, and they occupy relatively peripheral positions within the global collaboration network, suggesting that further improvement in their scientific influence is needed. Our bibliometric analysis identifies Mayo Clinic (USA) as the most influential institution in ET research, ranking first in both publication output and citation counts. Professor Ayalew Tefferi has made pioneering contributions to understanding the molecular pathology of ET, identifying risk factors for patient prognosis, and developing new therapeutic drugs. Over decades of patient follow-up, his research has had a profound impact on the academic community, earning him recognition as a foundational figure in ET research. The Blood and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) have played a crucial role in disseminating ET research findings, contributing the most to the spread of groundbreaking discoveries in ET. The journal overlay map reveals that research in the fields of \"Molecular Biology and Genetics\" and \"Health, Nursing, and Medicine\" forms the knowledge base for ET, while \"Molecular Biology and Immunology\" and \"Medicine, Medical Sciences, and Clinical\" represent the knowledge frontiers. This indicates that progress in the ET field follows an interdisciplinary pattern, suggesting that multidisciplinary research collaborations are more likely to achieve breakthrough results in this area. Trends and frontiers Bibliometric analysis of references and keywords reveals that the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation in 2005 redefined the pathogenesis of ET, prompting a transformation in its research and diagnostic frameworks. Approximately 50\u201360% of ET patients carry the JAK2 V617F mutation, which persistently activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, enabling abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in the absence of growth factors and hypersensitivity to hematopoietic stimuli [ 48 ]. This groundbreaking discovery established molecular mechanisms as the central theme in ET research. Subsequent studies identified two additional key driver mutations in JAK2 -negative patients: CALR and MPL . CALR mutations, the most common among JAK2 -negative cases, account for 20\u201325% and indirectly activate the JAK-STAT pathway through dysregulation of calcium signaling and protein folding, leading to megakaryocyte proliferation and excessive platelet production [ 49 ]. MPL mutations, found in 5\u201310% of JAK2 -negative patients, similarly trigger ET by activating the JAK-STAT pathway [ 50 , 51 ]. In 2008, the WHO incorporated the JAK2 V617F mutation into ET diagnostic criteria [ 29 ], with the 2016 revision refining standards to include JAK2 , CALR , MPL , and other driver mutations [ 35 ]. These updates propelled ET treatment toward personalized and precision medicine, with achieving molecular remission emerging as a new therapeutic goal. Despite significant advancements, the timeline of keywords shows that ET remains an active research area with unresolved challenges. Analysis of keyword bursts and time-overlay graphs highlights four major frontiers in ET research: disease heterogeneity, targeted therapy, inflammation, and management of high-risk and special patient populations. The following sections will provide a detailed review of these areas. Literature review Although ET is often considered the most benign subtype of MPN, its progression to myelofibrosis and leukemia is not uncommon, reflecting the significant heterogeneity of the disease. This heterogeneity primarily arises from differences in driver genes, mutation burden, and non-driver mutations. JAK2 , CALR , and MPL mutations can all lead to the ET phenotype; however, they exhibit notable differences in thrombotic risk and disease progression. The JAK2 mutation has a pronounced pro-inflammatory effect, increasing the risks of thrombosis and disease progression [ 52 ]. In contrast, the CALR mutation, while associated with elevated platelet counts, carries relatively lower risks of thrombosis and disease progression [ 38 ]. The MPL mutation primarily promotes fibroblast proliferation, thereby increasing the risk of bone marrow fibrosis [ 51 ]. Additionally, some patients test negative for all three driver mutations, referred to as \u201ctriple-negative ET\u201d, and the underlying pathogenesis in these cases remains unclear [ 53 ]. Differences in mutation burden further exacerbate ET heterogeneity. A high mutation burden correlates positively with disease severity, clonal hematopoiesis expansion, myelofibrosis, and leukemia transformation [ 54 ]. Patients with a high JAK2 mutation burden often respond poorly to hydroxyurea but exhibit better responses to JAK2 inhibitors [ 55 ]. Subtype differences exist within CALR mutations: type 1 mutations are associated with an increased risk of fibrosis, whereas type 2 mutations have a lower thrombotic risk [ 56 ]. Non-driver mutations further increase the genetic complexity of ET and have significant implications for prognosis and treatment decisions. Mutations such as TP53 , SRSF2 , SF3B1 , and U2AF1 are closely associated with poor prognosis and have been incorporated into the MIPSS-ET scoring system [ 57 ]. Additionally, mutations in TET2 , ASXL 1, and DNMT3A can promote abnormal DNA methylation, genomic instability, and clonal expansion, significantly increasing the risks of fibrosis and leukemic transformation [ 58 \u2013 61 ]. With ongoing research, the discovery of additional non-driver mutations is anticipated, and their integration into prognostic models will further refine risk stratification and treatment decisions for ET. The significant heterogeneity of ET substantially increases diagnostic complexity, particularly in distinguishing it from pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis (pre-PMF). The two conditions exhibit considerable overlap in driver mutations, clinical parameters, and bone marrow morphology, yet differ significantly in prognosis and management strategies, making their differential diagnosis a critical research focus. Compared to ET, pre-PMF patients typically exhibit markedly elevated white blood cell counts, reduced hemoglobin levels, more frequent elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, and a higher likelihood of splenomegaly [ 62 ]. Therefore, emphasizing secondary diagnostic criteria and employing a comprehensive diagnostic strategy that integrates bone marrow morphological features can improve the accuracy of distinguishing pre-PMF from ET [ 63 ]. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsy results remains the cornerstone of differentiating ET from pre-PMF. Deep learning-based integrated diagnostic models have demonstrated diagnostic capabilities comparable to those of experienced hematopathologists, achieving an AUC of 0.806 for identifying ET and 0.860 for identifying pre-PMF, significantly outperforming junior pathologists and showcasing substantial clinical potential [ 64 ]. Molecular genetic studies further provide more precise diagnostic evidence. Next-generation sequencing reveals significant molecular profile differences among pre-PMF, ET, and overt PMF. In pre-PMF patients, the frequency of EP300 mutations is significantly higher, whereas WT1 expression is elevated in overt PMF patients. These findings offer critical molecular evidence for the precise differentiation of MPN subtypes in the future [ 65 ]. Research on the molecular mechanisms of ET has driven the development of JAK2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, marking a new era in targeted therapy for ET. Ruxolitinib inhibits the JAK-STAT pathway, reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic cells, thereby lowering platelet levels, reducing thrombotic risk, and alleviating symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue [ 66 , 67 ]. Additionally, ruxolitinib may slow the progression of bone marrow fibrosis, an effect that has already been validated in patients with primary myelofibrosis [ 68 ]. However, despite the therapeutic benefits of JAK2 inhibitors, they have not fully replaced aspirin and hydroxyurea as the standard treatment for ET. This is partly because the genetic complexity of ET limits the widespread application of JAK2 inhibitors. Approximately 25\u201335% of ET patients are driven by CALR or MPL mutations, and some triple-negative patients may harbor as-yet-undiscovered mutations. The molecular mechanisms of ET differ from those of other MPNs: patients generally exhibit a relatively low mutation burden, and disease progression is typically slow [ 69 ]. For low-risk patients, the primary clinical goals are to control platelet levels and prevent thrombosis. Compared with conventional antiplatelet therapy, the therapeutic advantage of JAK2 inhibitors remains limited in this population [ 55 ]. For high-risk patients, while ruxolitinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy as a JAK2 inhibitor, its lack of selectivity and long-term use may cause bone marrow suppression and immune system impairment, compromising long-term survival benefits. Furthermore, high-risk patients often harbor multiple genetic mutations, making single-agent JAK2 inhibitor therapy insufficient to effectively control disease progression. As such, combination therapy may represent a more promising treatment strategy. In addition to ruxolitinib, the FDA has approved several novel JAK2 inhibitors, including Fedratinib, Pacritinib, and Momelotinib, which are primarily used to treat myelofibrosis. These drugs are associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects; however, they have yet to demonstrate significant improvement in overall survival [ 70 , 71 ]. Moving forward, combining novel JAK2 inhibitors with other therapeutic approaches may provide long-term therapeutic benefits for high-risk ET patients. Small molecule inhibitor therapies targeting CALR and MPL mutations are still in the early stages of development [ 72 , 73 ]. It is noteworthy that the C-terminal end of the CALR mutation is tumor-specific and that the CALR mutant complex translocates to the cell membrane. This unique feature has been experimentally validated as an effective therapeutic target, with monoclonal antibodies against the CALR mutation shown to reduce platelet counts, decrease tumor cell burden, and improve survival outcomes in animal models [ 74 , 75 ]. These findings highlight the potential of immunotherapies targeting the novel mutated CALR epitopes, including the use of modified tumor vaccine therapies [ 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 ], or combination therapies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors [ 78 , 79 ]. Stratified diagnosis and personalized treatment are central to ET research. Currently, low-risk elderly patients are often treated with hydroxyurea combined with low-dose aspirin, a regimen that effectively alleviates symptoms with manageable risks [ 80 ]. However, high-risk patients exhibit significant heterogeneity, with a more complex genetic background of hematopoietic stem cells involving polygenic mutations and higher thrombotic risk factors [ 81 ]. The combination of hydroxyurea and aspirin is insufficient to fully control the thrombotic risk in high-risk patients [ 82 ]. Although hydroxyurea does not increase the risk of leukemic transformation compared to the natural disease course [ 83 ], it cannot reverse or halt the progression of clonal evolution and is associated with an increased risk of bone marrow fibrosis [ 84 ]. Anagrelide, with its high selectivity for megakaryocytic lineages, is less likely to cause anemia or leukopenia, making it more suitable for the clinical characteristics of ET patients. However, in high-risk patients, hydroxyurea demonstrates advantages over anagrelide in terms of reducing arterial thrombotic events, severe bleeding, and the risk of progression to bone marrow fibrosis, along with better safety profiles [ 12 ]. A low starting dose of anagrelide (\u2264 0.5 mg/day) can reduce treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, indicating that optimized dosing strategies may improve treatment tolerability [ 85 ]. Further exploration and refinement of anagrelide usage hold promise for enhancing its therapeutic benefits. The efficacy of targeted therapy in high-risk patients is also limited, as JAK2 inhibitors struggle to durably suppress the mutation burden, and the complex genetic background further diminishes the effectiveness of monotherapy [ 86 ]. The diagnosis and management of pediatric and young ET patients pose greater challenges, primarily due to atypical clinical presentations and a lower prevalence of JAK2 mutations. Some patients may carry unidentified mutations or possess a more complex genetic background [ 87 ]. Existing risk stratification models, primarily based on data from adult patients, may not be fully applicable to this population. Moreover, the lack of long-term follow-up data leaves uncertainties regarding the risk of progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia. The long-term safety of hydroxyurea in this group raises concerns, as it may lead to bone marrow suppression and an increased risk of malignant transformation [ 88 ]. Similarly, the application of targeted therapies, such as JAK2 inhibitors, in this population remains highly uncertain [ 89 ]. In summary, pediatric and young ET patients currently lack personalized treatment strategies and robust long-term prognostic assessments. Future studies should focus on this specific population to optimize treatment approaches and establish comprehensive follow-up systems. Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of ET. Studies have shown that inflammation is not only a clinical feature of ET but may also act as one of its triggering factors. Epidemiological data indicate that chronic inflammatory conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, significantly increase the risk of developing MPNs, suggesting that inflammation may contribute to the etiology of ET [ 90 ]. Furthermore, inflammation positively correlates with mutation burden and can damage vascular endothelial cells, promote platelet aggregation and activation, and subsequently increase the risk of thrombosis [ 91 \u2013 94 ]. Against the backdrop of aberrant JAK-STAT pathway activation, inflammation further stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic cells, exacerbating thrombotic risk [ 95 , 96 ]. Inflammation can also interfere with the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells through oxidative damage, leading to the expansion of abnormal clonal cells, accelerated accumulation of gene mutations, and genomic instability, thereby promoting the progression of ET to acute leukemia [ 97 \u2013 103 ]. In patients harboring additional mutations, such as TET2 or ASXL1 , inflammation-induced stem cell dysfunction and clonal expansion are particularly pronounced [ 104 \u2013 108 ]. Chronic inflammation further suppresses the functions of normal immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer cells, enabling abnormal clonal cells to evade immune surveillance and accelerating disease progression, which is especially evident in high-risk ET patients [ 109 \u2013 111 ]. Moreover, inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of bone marrow fibrosis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can stimulate macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, promoting fibrotic tissue deposition and extracellular matrix remodeling, ultimately leading to bone marrow fibrosis [ 112 \u2013 114 ]. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy may represent a promising treatment strategy for ET. In the final part of our discussion, we highlight recent advances in Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) research. As a first-line cytoreductive therapy, IFN-\u03b1 is particularly suited for young patients and women with fertility considerations [ 115 ], with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 (PEG-IFN\u03b1) improving adherence and tolerability. However, IFN-\u03b1 received relatively limited attention in our bibliometric analysis, possibly due to its well-established clinical role. Despite this, IFN-\u03b1 continues to evolve in ET management. PEG-IFN has demonstrated superior hematologic control, molecular remission, and symptom improvement, particularly in reducing JAK2 V617F mutation burden [ 116 ]. Additionally, IFN-\u03b1 combined with JAK1/2 inhibitors accelerates mutation burden reduction [ 117 ], though further optimization is needed. In hydroxyurea-intolerant patients, PEG-IFN achieves higher remission rates, with CALR -mutated cases deriving greater benefit [ 118 ], while also providing superior symptom relief in high-burden patients [ 119 ]. Mechanistically, IFN-\u03b1 selectively depletes JAK2 V617F-positive hematopoietic stem cells, suppressing mutant clone expansion [ 120 ]. However, DNMT3A mutations enhance stem cell self-renewal, attenuating IFN-\u03b1 efficacy, suggesting that combining IFN-\u03b1 with hypomethylating agents may help overcome resistance [ 121 ]. In summary, IFN-\u03b1 remains a cornerstone of cytoreductive therapy in ET, and with ongoing research, its clinical role is expected to expand further. Conclusions This study utilizes a variety of bibliometric tools to systematically analyze and review ET-related publications over the past two decades, aiming to help researchers and clinicians quickly and comprehensively grasp the progress of ET research. In summary, ET research has shown steady growth, with close collaboration between numerous research institutions and scholars in the United States and Europe driving rapid advancements in the field. The successive discovery of driver genes has fundamentally transformed the landscape of ET research and clinical practice. Currently, ET-related research themes remain active, with many key issues still unresolved. Among these, heterogeneity, targeted therapies, management of high-risk and special populations, and inflammation have emerged as current research frontiers. Breakthroughs in these areas are expected to elevate ET research to new heights and enable better management and treatment for ET patients. Limitation This study utilized data exclusively from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), a widely recognized and authoritative database. While this choice ensures the overall quality and reliability of the dataset, it may have limitations. Specifically, the exclusion of literature from non-core journals, other databases (e.g., Scopus, PubMed), and non-English publications could result in the omission of regionally or thematically significant studies, thus limiting the comprehensiveness of our analysis. Another inherent limitation of bibliometric studies lies in citation biases, including self-citation and citation habits. Such patterns may unintentionally inflate the perceived academic influence of specific authors, institutions, or networks. Although our results are based on objective quantitative metrics, readers should interpret the findings with an awareness of these potential biases. Additionally, bibliometric analyses naturally favor older publications due to their extended time to accumulate citations, which may disadvantage more recent high-impact studies. Similarly, the reliance on citation-based metrics may underrepresent research with significant clinical relevance that has not yet gained substantial academic attention. Despite these limitations, we believe our study provides a robust and valuable overview of ET research trends, highlighting key contributors, hotspots, and developmental trajectories in the field. As bibliometric methodologies evolve, improvements in database coverage, citation normalization, and bias mitigation are expected to address many of the current constraints, further enhancing the precision and applicability of such analyses. The broader landscape of ET research encompasses additional themes and unresolved challenges. To provide a more comprehensive perspective, we have summarized these in Supplementary Table S1, which outlines key advances and persistent gaps across the field.

    "full_text_abstract": "Objective This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of ET research, focusing on contributions from authors, institutions, and countries or regions, while mapping collaboration networks. Furthermore, it identifies development trends to provide insights for future research. Methods A bibliometric analysis of ET-related publications (2001\u20132024) was conducted using data from the Web of Science Core Collection, focusing on publication trends, co-authorship networks, co-citation relationships, and citation bursts. Results A total of 4,297 studies published in 778 journals were included in the analysis. ET research has grown rapidly, with major contributions from researchers in the United States and Europe, particularly through extensive collaborations. Leading figures such as Ayalew Tefferi and Alessandro M. Vannucchi have driven advances in ET classification, molecular mechanisms, and targeted therapies. The discovery of driver mutations, such as JAK2 , has revolutionized the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ET. Research focus has shifted from clinical morphological diagnosis to molecular diagnostics, with the field now entering the era of targeted therapies. However, the heterogeneity of ET, the limitations of targeted therapies, particularly the lack of management experience and data for high-risk and special populations, as well as the incomplete understanding of the role of inflammation in the disease mechanism, continue to hinder both clinical and scientific progress in ET research. Conclusions Bibliometric analysis demonstrates significant advances in ET research, particularly in molecular pathology and targeted therapies. Future research should address ET heterogeneity, optimize management of high-risk and special populations, overcome the limitations of targeted therapies, and further elucidate the role of inflammation to achieve individualized precision therapy.
