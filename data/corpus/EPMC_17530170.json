  "abstract_text": "Neurodegenerative disease strikes millions worldwide and there is mounting evidence suggesting that underlying the onset and progression of these debilitating diseases is inappropriate neuronal apoptosis. Recent reports have implicated a family of proteins known as histone deacetylases (HDACs) in various neuronal processes including the neuronal death program. Initial headway in this field has been made largely through the use of broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors. In fact, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC activity has been shown to protect neurons in several models of neurodegeneration. The observation that HDAC inhibitors can have opposing effects in different paradigms of neurodegeneration suggests that individual members of the HDAC protein family may play distinct roles that could depend on the specific cell type under study. The purpose of this review is to detail work involving the use of HDAC inhibitors within the context of neurodegeneration and examine the roles of individual HDAC members in the nervous system with specific focus on neuronal cell death.",
