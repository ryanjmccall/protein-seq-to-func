    "abstract_text": "Using human glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a novel human centrosome associated protein, hNinein. When the full length cDNA of hNinein was sequenced, it showed that an open reading frame encoded a protein consisting of 2047 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 239 kDa. The features of this protein include a potential GTP binding site, a large coiled-coil domain together with four leucine zipper domains and a GSK-3beta binding site. Fluorescence microscopy experiment showed that hNinein is localized in the pericentriolar matrix of the centrosome. In addition, hNinein also showed to react with centrosomal autoantibody sera. Our findings suggest that hNinein may be involved in the formation of centrosome matrix and interacts with the GSK-3beta, implying that it may also be regulated by GSK-3beta phosphorylation signaling.",
