  "abstract_text": "Essential hypertension remains a major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. As a complex multifactorial disease, elucidation of susceptibility loci remains elusive. ATP1A1 and Dear are candidate genes for 2 closely linked rat chromosome-2 blood pressure quantitative trait loci. Because corresponding human syntenic regions are on different chromosomes, investigation of ATP1A1 (chromosome [chr]-1p21) and Dear (chr-4q31.3) facilitates genetic analyses of each blood pressure quantitative trait locus in human hypertension. Here we report the association of human ATP1A1 (P<0.000005) and Dear (P<0.03) with hypertension in a relatively isolated, case/control hypertension cohort from northern Sardinia by single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotype analysis. Sex-specific haplotype analyses detected stronger association of both loci with hypertension in males than in females. Haplotype trend-regression analyses support ATP1A1 and Dear as independent susceptibility loci and reveal haplotype-specific association with hypertension and normotension, thus delineating haplotype-specific subsets of hypertension. Although investigation in other cohorts needs to be performed to determine genetic effects in other populations, haplotype subtyping already allows systematic stratification of susceptibility and, hence, clinical heterogeneity, a prerequisite for unraveling the polygenic etiology and polygene-environment interactions in essential hypertension. As hypertension susceptibility genes, coexpression of ATP1A1 and Dear in both renal tubular cells and vascular endothelium suggest a cellular pathogenic scaffold for polygenic mechanisms of hypertension, as well as the hypothesis that ATP1A1 and/or Dear could contribute to the known renal and vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with essential (polygenic) hypertension.",
