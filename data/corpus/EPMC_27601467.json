  "abstract_text": "The replication protein A (RPA) complex binds single-stranded DNA generated at stalled replication forks and recruits other DNA repair proteins to promote recovery of these forks. Here, we identify Ewing tumor-associated antigen 1 (ETAA1), which has been linked to susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, as a new repair protein that is recruited to stalled forks by RPA. We demonstrate that ETAA1 interacts with RPA through two regions, each of which resembles two previously identified RPA-binding domains, RPA70N-binding motif and RPA32C-binding motif, respectively. In response to replication stress, ETAA1 is recruited to stalled forks where it colocalizes with RPA, and this recruitment is diminished when RPA is depleted. Notably, inactivation of the ETAA1 gene increases the collapse level of the stalled replication forks and decreases the recovery efficiency of these forks. Moreover, epistasis analysis shows that ETAA1 stabilizes stalled replication forks in an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)-independent manner. Thus, our results reveal that ETAA1 is a novel RPA-interacting protein that promotes restart of stalled replication forks.",
