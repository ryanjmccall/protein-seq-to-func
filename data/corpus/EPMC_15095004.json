    "abstract_text": "In a journey lasting 40 years from the first reports on its activity in the 1960s to its purification and the cloning of relevant complementary DNAs, peptide O-xylosyltransferase has finally arrived at the same point as many other enzymes. This enzyme, whose systematic name is UDP-alpha-D-xylose:proteoglycan core protein beta-D-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26), catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of chondroitin, dermatan and heparan sulphates in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or the cis-Golgi cisternae. Analyses of their primary structure show that peptide O-xylosyltransferases are members of glycosyltransferase family 14 and so are homologous to beta1,6- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases involved in O-glycan and poly- N-acetyllactosamine branching. Furthermore, vertebrates appear to have two rather similar genes encoding xylosyltransferase I and xylosyltransferase II, but enzymatic activity was only detected for a recombinant form of the first isoform. On the other hand, Caenorhabditis and Drosophila have each only one peptide O-xylosyltransferase gene. In the worm sqv-6 mutant, a mutation of the xylosyltransferase gene is associated with defective vulval morphogenesis, indicative of the importance of the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans in animal development. There remain, however, open questions, for instance, on the enzyme's intracellular localisation and structure-function relationships.",
