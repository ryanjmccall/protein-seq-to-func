    "abstract_text": "<h4>Background</h4>The molecular basis of heterotaxy and congenital heart malformations associated with disruption of left-right asymmetry is broad and heterogenous, with over 25 genes implicated in its pathogenesis thus far.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to elucidate the molecular basis of laterality disorders and associated congenital heart defects in a cohort of 30 unrelated probands of Arab-Muslim descent, using next-generation sequencing techniques.<h4>Methods</h4>Detailed clinical phenotyping followed by whole-exome sequencing (WES) was pursued for each of the probands and their parents (when available). Sanger sequencing was used for segregation analysis of disease-causing mutations in the families.<h4>Results</h4>Using WES, we reached a molecular diagnosis for 17 of the 30 probands (56.7%). Genes known to be associated with heterotaxy and/or primary ciliary dyskinesia, in which homozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected, included <i>CFAP53 (CCDC11)</i>, <i>CFAP298</i> (<i>C21orf59</i>), <i>CFAP300</i>, <i>LRRC6</i>, <i>GDF1</i>, <i>DNAAF1</i>, <i>DNAH5</i>, <i>CCDC39</i>, <i>CCDC40</i>, <i>PKD1L1</i> and <i>TTC25</i>. Additionally, we detected a homozygous disease causing mutation in <i>DAND5</i>, as a novel recessive monogenic cause for heterotaxy in humans. Three additional probands were found to harbour variants of uncertain significance. These included variants in <i>DNAH6</i>, <i>HYDIN</i>, <i>CELSR1</i> and <i>CFAP46</i>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings contribute to the current knowledge regarding monogenic causes of heterotaxy and its associated congenital heart defects and underscore the role of next-generation sequencing techniques in the diagnostic workup of such patients, and especially among consanguineous families.",
