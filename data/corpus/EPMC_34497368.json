ERK1/2 are known to be activated by MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-mediated phosphorylation. Here we show that ERK1/2 are also modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. We identify the tripartite motif-containing protein TRIM15 as a ubiquitin ligase, and the tumor suppressor CYLD as a deubiquitinase, for ERKs. TRIM15 and CYLD regulate ERK ubiquitination at defined lysine residues via mutually exclusive interactions as well as opposing activities. K63-linked polyubiquitination enhances ERK interaction with and activation by MEK. Down-regulation of TRIM15 inhibits growth of both drug-responsive and -resistant melanomas. Moreover, high TRIM15 expression and low CYLD expression are associated with poor prognosis of melanoma patients. These findings define a role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in the ERK signaling pathway and suggest a potential target for cancer therapy. Introduction The extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2, which share high structural and functional similarity, are prototypes of the evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1 . ERK1/2 are the downstream effectors of a kinase cascade that also includes the RAF-family serine/threonine kinases and the dual-specificity MAPK/ERK kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which becomes activated in response to growth factors and mitogens 2 , 3 . Upon activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylate a plethora of cytosolic and nuclear substrates to elicit fundamental responses including cell growth, proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. A hyperactive ERK pathway is prevalent in human tumors due to frequent mutations and/or overexpression of the upstream signaling components including receptor tyrosine kinases, the Ras GTPase, and RAFs 4 . Reactivation of ERK1/2 is also a common mechanism that confers resistance to drugs that inhibit these oncogenic components including mutant BRAF 5 – 7 , underscoring the importance of ERKs themselves as therapeutic targets 8 , 9 . Nevertheless, the mechanisms that govern ERK activation are not fully defined. MAPK cascades represent a paradigm for phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction 2 , 3 , and it is unclear what other forms of posttranslational modification can also directly regulate the activation of ERKs or any other MAPKs. Moreover, MAPK cascades have evolved high specificity with the substrates for the upstream kinases being largely limited to the kinases next in the cascade, which ensures that each MAPK cascade responds to an exclusive set of extracellular stimuli 1 . ERK1 and ERK2 are the only known substrates of the dual-specificity kinases MEK1/2, and they are activated by phosphorylation at the Thr and Tyr residues of the activation loop. However, what facilitates the highly effective and specific signal transmission from MEK to ERK remains undefined. Ubiquitination regulates protein function as well as stability 10 . Especially, conjugation to Lysine-63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin polymers is involved in the activation of kinases in NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways 11 – 14 . Here, we find that ERK1 and ERK2 are modified by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, correlating with their activation. We identify a ubiquitin ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) for ERK1/2, and investigate the role of this non-degradative form of ubiquitination in ERK activation and the growth of both drug-responsive and -resistant melanomas. RESULTS ERK1/2 are conjugated to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains To investigate a potential role of K63 ubiquitination in ERK1/2 activation, we treated human melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). Endogenous ERK1/2 were activated upon IGF1 stimulation, as shown by phosphorylation of the ERK activation loop and the ERK substrate ELK-1 ( Fig. 1a ). Interestingly, K63 ubiquitin-conjugated ERK1/2 proteins, which were low in unstimulated cells, increased over time and eventually reached high levels ( Fig. 1a ). Similarly, when HEK293T cells expressing Flag-ERK1 were treated with IGF1, K63 ubiquitinated Flag-ERK1 increased in an oscillating pattern, in parallel with its activation ( Fig. 1b , lanes 1–6). Moreover, when lung cancer A549 cells expressing Flag-ERK1 were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), Flag-ERK1 was heavily modified by K63 ubiquitin chains as it became activated ( Fig. 1c ). TRIM15 is a K63-specific ubiquitin ligase for ERK1/2 The close correlation between K63 ubiquitination and activation of ERK1/2 prompted us to identify the ubiquitin ligase responsible for this modification. The human genome encodes over 600 ubiquitin ligases 15 – 17 . A subgroup of these ligases includes over 70 tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, which are defined by a TRIM/RBCC motif consisting of a RING domain, one or two B-boxes, and a predicted coiled-coil region 18 , 19 . TRIMs are involved in a plethora of cellular processes including anti-viral responses, tumorigenesis 18 , 19 , and protein quality control 20 – 24 . Moreover, at least four TRIMs (TRIM5, −8, −21, and −25) can mediate K63 ubiquitination of their target proteins 25 – 28 . Therefore, we screened TRIM proteins for their ability to ubiquitinate ERK1/2. When the first eighteen human TRIMs were expressed individually with Flag-ERK1 in HEK293T cells, TRIM15, but not the other TRIMs, strongly promoted ERK1 ubiquitination ( Extended Data Fig. 1a , b ). This effect of TRIM15 was dose dependent ( Fig. 1d ) and involved K63-linked ubiquitin chains ( Fig. 1e ). Similarly, TRIM15 promoted K63 ubiquitination of Flag-ERK2 ( Fig. 1e ). In contrast, a TRIM15 mutant lacking the RING and B-Box domains (TRIM15 ΔRB ) was unable to ubiquitinate ERK1 or ERK2 ( Fig. 1e ). Polyubiquitination can occur via seven different Lys resides on ubiquitin 15 – 17 . To ascertain that TRIM15 promotes K63 ubiquitination of ERK1/2, we used a panel of ubiquitin mutants in which one Lys residue was retained while the rest being replaced with Arg, and observed that K63 ubiquitin, but not the other mutants, supported TRIM15-mediated ERK1 modification ( Fig. 1f ). Complementarily, we used a ubiquitin mutant in which K63 and, as a control, K48, were replaced with Arg (K63R and K48R, respectively). K63R ubiquitin was unable to support ERK1 modification, whereas K48R ubiquitin, which blocks the ubiquitin linkage that primarily targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, was able to ( Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1c ). Consistently, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, while increasing total ubiquitinated proteins in the cell, did not alter ERK1 ubiquitination or abundance ( Fig. 1h ). Therefore, TRIM15 mediates the non-degradative, K63 ubiquitination of ERK1/2. The activity of TRIM15 appears to be specific, as another K63 ubiquitin ligase, TRAF2, failed to ubiquitinate ERK1 ( Extended Data Fig. 1d ). TRIM15 is expressed in melanoma cell lines at different levels ( Extended Data Fig. 2a , b ). To evaluate the effect of TRIM15 on endogenous ERK1/2, we forced its expression in G361 cells where TRIM15 levels were relatively low. This resulted in a noticeable increase in K63 ubiquitination of endogenous ERK1/2 ( Fig. 1i ). Conversely, when TRIM15 was knocked down using independent short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in A375 cells where TRIM15 levels were relatively high, K63 ubiquitination of ERK1/2 markedly declined ( Fig. 1j ). Similarly, knocking down TRIM15 in SK-MEL-28 cells not only strongly reduced basal levels of K63-ubiquitinated ERK1/2 under unstimulated conditions, but also near-completely prevented their increase under IGF1-stimulated conditions ( Fig. 1k ). Moreover, knocking out TRIM15 in HEK293T cells by means of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing near-completely abrogated the increase in K63 ubiquitination of Flag-ERK1 following IGF1 stimulation ( Fig. 1b , lanes 7–12). Therefore, TRIM15 is critical for K63 ubiquitination of ERK1/2 in both unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated cells. TRIM15 promotes ERK1/2 activation Forced TRIM15 expression also accentuated ERK1/2 activation. This was observed for endogenous ERK1/2 in G361, SK-MEL-94, and lung cancer A549 cells ( Fig. 2a ), as well as for Flag-ERK1 in HEK293T cells ( Extended Data Fig. 2c ). A comparison of recombinant Flag-ERK1 proteins purified from HEK293T cells where it was expressed alone and hence minimally ubiquitinated (referred to as Flag-ERK1), or together with TRIM15 and hence substantially ubiquitinate (referred to as Flag-ERK1 Ub ), confirmed that the latter possessed higher kinase activity ( Fig. 2b ). Conversely, knocking down or knocking out TRIM15 decreased basal activity of endogenous ERK1/2 in SK-MEL-28, A375, SK-MEL-173, and colon cancer HT29 cells ( Fig. 2c , d and Extended Data Fig. 2d , e ). It also effectively abolished the increase in ERK activity in IGF1-stimulated SK-MEL-28 cells ( Fig. 2d ). Likewise, knocking out TRIM15 prevented the increase in endogenous ERK1/2 and Flag-ERK1 activity in IGF1-stimulated HEK293T cells ( Fig. 1b , 2e ). Knocking down TRIM15 also reduced expression of ERK-regulated proteins cyclin D1 and BCL2 29 – 31 , similar to the treatment of the MEK inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) ( Extended Data Fig. 2f , g ). However, TRIM15 knockdown or knockout did not alter the activation of MEK1/2 ( Fig. 2c , e ). These results indicate that TRIM15 regulates the ERK signaling pathway at the level of ERK1/2 activation. TRIM15 activates ERK1/2 by K63 ubiquitination To ascertain that TRIM15 activates ERK1/2 by ubiquitination, we determined the ubiquitination site(s) on these MAPKs. An analysis of purified Flag-ERK1 Ub protein by mass spectrometry revealed that at least eleven Lys residues of ERK1 might be conjugated to ubiquitin ( Extended Data Fig. 3 ). We mutated all the eleven, as well as six additional, Lys residues to Arg. Two mutations (K168R and K302R) displayed a marked reduction in TRIM15-mediated ubiquitination ( Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4a , b ). The combined mutation, K168R/K302R or 2KR, exhibited virtually no ubiquitination in unstimulated or IGF1-stimulated cells ( Fig. 2f , g ). In vitro , TRIM15 promoted K63 ubiquitination of ERK1, but not ERK1 2KR ( Fig. 2h ). Thus, TRIM15 ubiquitinates ERK1 mainly at K168 and K302 residues. An alignment of amino acid sequences revealed that K168 and K302 are conserved in ERK2, corresponding to K149 and K283, respectively ( Extended Data Fig. 4c ). An ERK2 mutation in which K149 and K283 were replaced with Arg (K149R/R283R or 2KR) could not be ubiquitinated by TRIM15 ( Fig. 2i ). Thus, TRIM15 ubiquitinates ERK2 mainly at K149 and K283 residues. Compared to their wild-type counterparts, ERK1 2KR and ERK2 2KR exhibited substantially weaker kinase activity in A375, D14, SK-MEL-28, and HEK293T cells ( Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 4d , e ). Treatment of A375 cells, which harbor the oncogenic BRAF V600E allele, with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) 32 suppressed the activity of ERK1/2, but not ERK1/2 2KR ( Fig. 2j ), indicating that ERK1 2KR and ERK2 2KR are nonresponsive to the mitogenic signals emanating from BRAF V600E . Forced expression of ERK1 or ERK2 can reduce cell viability in a kinase activity-dependent manner 33 , but ERK1 2KR or ERK2 2KR elicited no cytotoxic effect in A375 cells ( Extended Data Fig. 4f ). Also, recombinant ERK1 2KR and ERK2 2KR proteins purified from HEK293T cells displayed virtually no kinase activity towards ELK-1 ( Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 4g ). Ubiquitination at K302 appeared to be more abundant than that at K168 ( Extended Data Fig. 3 ). K302 residue is accessible on the surface of ERK1, whereas K168 belongs to the catalytic loop ( 164 HRDLK 168 ) ( Extended Data Fig. 4h , i ), whose attachment to a poly-ubiquitin chain might create a local steric hindrance that impedes, rather than increases, ERK1 kinase activity. Thus, we tested the possibility that ubiquitination at K302 is the main activating event. When introduced into HEK293T cells, ERK1 K302R , like ERK1 2KR , displayed substantially lower ubiquitination than ERK1, which was not increased upon IGF1 stimulation ( Fig. 2l ). ERK1 K302R also displayed reduced phosphorylation at the activation loop ( Fig. 2m and Extended Data Fig. 4j ), which was not increased by co-expression with TRIM15 ( Fig. 2m ). Collectively, these results indicate that TRIM15 activates ERK1/2 by conjugating K63 ubiquitin chains to specific Lys residues, particularly K302 on ERK1 and the corresponding K283 on ERK2. TRIM15 interacts with ERK1/2 via conserved domains MAPKs often stably interact with their regulators/substrates via the common docking (CD) domain on MAPKs and the D domain-docking site on the regulators/substrates 34 – 36 . We observed interaction between endogenous TRIM15 and ERK1/2 in A375 and HEK293T cells ( Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a ). Upon IGF1 treatment, the TRIM15-ERK1/2 interaction was strengthened ( Fig. 3a ), as these proteins were incorporated into large complexes ( Fig. 3b ). In vitro , purified Flag-TRIM15 bound to a glutathione S -transferase (GST) fusion of ERK1, but not GST ( Fig. 3c ), indicating that TRIM15 may directly binds to ERKs. To delineate structural determinants of the TRIM15-ERK interaction, we generated a panel of TRIM15 deletion mutations that lacked one or more domains within the N-terminal TRIM/RBCC motif (ΔR, ΔRB, and ΔCC) or the C-terminal PRY-SPRY region (ΔPS) ( Fig. 3d ). TRIM15 ΔR , TRIM15 ΔRB , and TRIM15 ΔCC retained the ability to interact with ERK1 ( Fig. 3e ), while TRIM15 ΔPS lost this ability, suggesting that the PRY-SPRY region is involved in the binding to ERKs. We identified a potential D domain-docking site within the TRIM15 PRY-SPRY region ( Fig. 3f ). A TRIM15 mutant in which four conserved residues within this site were placed with Ala (4A, Fig. 3f ) failed to bind to and ubiquitinate ERK1 ( Fig. 3g – i ). Moreover, a mutant ERK1 in which two conserved Asp residues with the CD domain were changed to Asn (D335N/D338N or 2DN; Fig. 3j ) showed minimal or no binding to, and ubiquitination by, TRIM15 ( Fig. 3k , l and Extended Data Fig. 5b ). Thus, the D domain-docking site of TRIM15 likely anchors on the CD domain of ERK1/2, enabling TRIM15 to deliver ubiquitin molecules onto ERK1/2. TRIM15 promotes ERK1/2 interaction with and activation by MEK The K302 residue is within the αH-helix, which is adjacent to the αF-helix that functions as a central scaffold for the entire structure of ERK1 ( Extended Data Fig. 4h ) 37 – 39 . K63 ubiquitination at this and the corresponding residue in ERK2 might alter the conformation of ERKs, increasing their interactions with ATP, substrates, and/or activators. However, recombinant Flag-ERK1, Flag-ERK1 Ub , and Flag-ERK1 K302R proteins purified from mammalian cells, although differently ubiquitinated, bound to ATP ( Extended Data Fig. 5c , d ) or ELK-1 ( Extended Data Fig. 5e , f ) to a comparable extent. Moreover, overexpression of TRIM15 did not enhance the interaction of ERK1 with ELK-1 in cells ( Extended Data Fig. 5g ). Of note, upon mitogenic stimulation, the ERK-MEK interaction increased following the increase in the TRIM15-ERK interaction ( Fig. 3a ). Thus, we examined whether TRIM15 promotes the ERK-MEK interaction. Forced TRIM15 expression augmented the interaction of Flag-ERK1 with endogenous MEK1/2 in unstimulated and IGF1-stimulated HEK293T cells ( Fig. 4a ). Conversely, TRIM15 knockout diminished the interaction of Flag-ERK1 with endogenous MEK1/2 in unstimulated HEK293T cells ( Fig. 4b ). TRIM15 knockdown also reduced endogenous ERK-MEK interaction in unstimulated HEK293T, A549, and A375 cells and prevented its increase in IGF1- or EGF-stimulated cells ( Fig. 4c , d and Extended Data Fig. 5h ). Thus, TRIM15 promotes the interaction of ERKs with MEKs. To evaluate whether ubiquitination enhances the ERK-MEK interaction, we compared ERK1 with different extents of ubiquitination for binding to MEK1 or MEK1 DD , a constitutively active form of MEK1 (ref. 40 ). Flag-ERK1 ub interacted with MEK1 DD more strongly than Flag-ERK1 in vitro ( Fig. 4e ). A Flag-ERK1 protein that was near-completely conjugated with K63-linked ubiquitin chains (referred to as Flag-ERK1-Ub) also interacted with MEK1 more strongly than Flag-ERK1 ( Fig. 4f ). On the contrary, compared to ERK1, both ERK1 2KR and ERK1 K302R exhibited a weaker interaction with MEK1 in cells ( Fig. 4g , h ) and with MEK1 DD in vitro ( Fig. 4i , j ). Therefore, ubiquitination of ERKs increases their interaction with MEKs. To determine whether ubiquitination-mediated ERK activation is dependent on phosphorylation at the activation loop, we used an ERK1 mutant in which Ser and Tyr at the activation loop TEY motif were replaced with Ala and Phe, respectively (ERK1 AEF ). Unlike Flag-ERK1, Flag-ERK1 AEF protein purified from HEK293T cells where it was expressed alone showed no activity towards ELK1 in vitro ( Fig. 4k ). Co-expression with TRIM15, although increasing ERK1 AEF ubiquitination ( Fig. 4l ), failed to activate ERK1 AEF ( Fig. 4k ). Thus, TRIM15-mediated activation of ERK1/2 requires the phosphorylation of these MAPKs by MEK. Collectively, these results indicate that TRIM15 promotes ERK interaction with and activation by MEK via K63 ubiquitination. CYLD is a K63-specific DUB for ERK1/2 Next, we sought to identify the DUB that may counteract the effect of TRIM15 on ERKs. The human genome encodes ~100 DUBs 41 , 42 . Whereas most DUBs display minimal or no preference for a certain ubiquitin linkage, a small number of them have evolved high specificity. Given that ERK1/2 can be targeted for proteasomal degradation presumably through K48-linked ubiquitination 43 , 44 , we reasoned that a TRIM15-antagonizing DUB may display high specificity for the K63 linkage. Among several K63 linkage-specific DUBs, we identified a potential D domain-docking site in the tumor suppressor CYLD (cylindromatosis-associated DUB) ( Fig. 3f , 5a ). Upon co-expression in cells, CYLD inhibited K63 ubiquitination of ERK1 ( Fig. 5b , c ). In contrast, but not a catalytically-inactive CYLD mutant (C601A or CA) as well as two other K63 linkage-specific DUBs, ovarian tumor-related protease 4 (OTUD4) and OTUD7B, did not alter ERK1 ubiquitination ( Fig. 5c ). CYLD, but CYLD CA , also cleaved virtually all the ubiquitin chains off of Flag-ERK1-Ub in vitro ( Fig. 5d ). CYLD, like TRIM15, was expressed in multiple melanoma cell lines ( Extended Data Fig. 2a ). Knocking down CYLD with independent siRNAs increased K63 ubiquitination of endogenous ERK1/2 in A375 cells ( Fig. 5e ). Similarly, knocking down CYLD with an shRNA increased K63 ubiquitination of Flag-ERK1 in unstimulated and IGF1-stimulated HEK293T cells ( Fig. 5f ). Moreover, compared to wild-type ( Cyld +/+ ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Cyld -knockout ( Cyld −/− ) MEFs contained a higher basal level of K63-ubiquitinated ERK1/2 and, in response to IGF1 treatment, up-regulated ERK ubiquitination to a greater extent ( Fig. 5g , h ). These results suggest that CYLD is a K63 linkage-specific DUB for ERK1/2. Forced expression of CYLD, but not CYLD CA , also reduced ERK1/2 activation in Cyld −/− MEFs and A375 cells ( Fig. 5i ). Conversely, knocking down CYLD elevated basal ERK1/2 activity in A375 cells in a manner correlating with the knockdown efficiency ( Fig. 5j ), and increased activity of Flag-ERK1 and endogenous ERK1/2 in unstimulated and IGF1-stimulated HEK293T cells ( Fig. 5f , k ). Moreover, compared to Cyld +/+ MEFs, Cyld −/− MEFs displayed higher basal ERK1/2 activity and accentuated ERK1/2 activity more strongly upon IGF1 treatment ( Fig. 5l and Extended Data Fig. 6a ). Therefore, CYLD keeps ERK1/2 in a hypo-ubiquitinated, inactive state. In the presence of MEK1 DD , recombinant Flag-ERK1-Ub displayed a higher level of kinase activity ( Fig. 5m ) and activation loop phosphorylation ( Fig. 5n ) than Flag-ERK1. Treatment with CYLD effectively abolished the difference between Flag-ERK1-Ub and Flag-ERK1 ( Fig. 5m , n ). These results further indicate that TRIM15-mediated ubiquitination enhances, while CYLD-mediated deubiquitination inhibits, activation of ERK1/2 by MEK. CYLD interacts with ERK1/2 via conserved domains Upon co-expression, GFP-CYLD and GFP-CYLD CA interacted with Flag-ERK1 in HEK293T cells ( Fig. 6a ). Endogenous CYLD and ERK1/2 also interacted with each other in A375 cells ( Extended Data Fig. 6b ). In vitro , Flag-CYLD was pulled down by GST-ERK1, but not GST ( Fig. 6b ), indicating that a direct interaction between CYLD and ERK1. A mutant CYLD in which four conserved residues within the D domain-docking site were replaced with Ala (4A; Fig. 3f ) exhibited a weakened ability to bind to ERK1 ( Fig. 6b ). CYLD 4A was also ineffective in deubiquitinating and inactivating ERK1 ( Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 6c ), although it was fully capable of deubiquitinating another substrate, TRAF2 ( Extended Data Fig. 6d ) 11 . Moreover, ERK1 2DN showed no or minimal interaction with CYLD ( Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 6e ). Thus, the CYLD-ERK interaction, like the TRIM15-ERK interaction, may be mediated by the D domain-docking site and the CD domain on the respective proteins. CYLD inhibits ERK interactions with TRIM15 and MEK Given that both TRIM15 and CYLD interact with the CD domain on ERK, we tested whether they compete for the binding. Overexpressing CYLD, but not CYLD 4A , impeded the TRIM15-ERK1 interaction in cells ( Fig. 6e ). In vitro, recombinant CYLD near-completely blocked the association of TRIM15 with ERK1 ( Fig. 6f ). Conversely, knocking down CYLD increased the interactions of endogenous TRIM15 and ERK1/2 in A375 cells ( Fig. 6g ) and HA-TRIM15 and Flag-ERK1 in HEK293T cells ( Extended Data Fig. 6f ). The TRIM15-ERK interaction was also stronger in Cyld −/− than Cyld +/+ MEFs ( Extended Data Fig. 6g ). Moreover, an increase in the TRIM15-ERK1 association upon IGF1 stimulation was accompanied by a decline in the CYLD-ERK1 association ( Fig. 6h ). Thus, CYLD likely inhibits the TRIM15-ERK interaction. Knockdown of CYLD also enhanced endogenous ERK-MEK interaction in A395 cells ( Fig. 6i ) and interaction of Flag-ERK1 with endogenous MEK in HEK293T cells ( Extended Data Fig. 6h ). As the interaction of ERK1/2 with CYLD declined following IGF1 stimulation, the interaction of ERK1/2 with MEK increased ( Fig. 6j ). Thus, CYLD also impedes the ERK-MEK interaction. Collectively, these results indicate that TRIM15 and CYLD regulate ERK activation through competitive binding in addition to opposing activities. Distinct signaling specificities of CYLD and TRIM15 Mutations in CYLD are associated with cylindromas, a familial skin tumor of the head and neck 45 , as well as other tumors including melanoma ( Extended Data Fig. 7a ) 46 , 47 . The tumor suppressive function of CYLD has been attributed in part to its inhibition of NF-κB signaling 48 – 50 . To evaluate whether tumor-associated CYLD mutants also lose the ability to regulate the ERK pathway, we generated two melanoma-associated mutants (F675S and P698L) and a skin tumor-associated mutant (D681G) in the ubiquitin specific protease (USP) domain ( Extended Data Fig. 7b ). These CYLD mutants were unable to cleave di-Ub or remove ubiquitin chains from ERK1-Ub ( Extended Data Fig. 7c , d ). They also failed to reverse ERK1/2 activation in CYLD-knockdown cells ( Fig. 6k ), and to suppress TRAF2-induced NF-κB signaling in control and CYLD-knockdown cells ( Fig. 6l and Extended Data Fig. 7e ). These results further indicate that CYLD regulates the ERK pathway in addition to the NF-κB pathway. In contrast to CYLD, overexpression of TRIM15 did not activate NF-κB ( Extended Data Fig. 7f ). Suppression of the ERK pathway by PLX4032 or trametinib did not affect levels of NF-κB pathway components either ( Extended Data Fig. 7g ). Moreover, knockdown of TRIM15 did not affect the activation of Stat3 or the mTOR target S6, and only moderately reduced the activation of Akt ( Extended Data Fig. 7h ). Therefore, TRIM15 appears to be specific for the ERK pathway. A role of TRIM15 in oncogenic growth of melanoma The stimulatory effect of TRIM15 on ERK prompted us to investigate its role in melanoma. TRIM15-knockdown A375 cells ( Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 8a , b ) and TRIM15-knockout SK-MEL-173 cells ( Fig. 7b ) proliferated substantially slower compared to their respective control cells. An shRNA-resistant form of TRIM15, but not TRIM15 ΔRB , restored ERK1/2 and proliferation in TRIM15-knockdown A375 cells ( Fig. 7c , d and Extended Data Fig. 8c ). Depleting CYLD in TRIM15-knockdown A375 cells also restored ERK1 activity and proliferation ( Fig. 7e , f and Extended Data Fig. 8d ). These results suggest that TRIM15 promotes, while CYLD inhibits, proliferation of melanoma cells. Knocking down TRIM15 also impeded anchorage-independent growth of A375 cells ( Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 8e ) and SK-MEL-28 cells ( Fig. 7h and Extended Data Fig. 8f ). This defect was again rescued by the shRNA-resistant form of TRIM15, but not TRIM15 ΔRB ( Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 8e ). It was also rescued by a constitutively active form of ERK1 (ERK1 R84S ; Fig. 7h and Extended Data Fig. 8f ) 51 , further indicating that TRIM15 regulates tumor cell proliferation via the ERK pathway. In a xenograft model, tumors produced by TRIM15-knockdown cells progressed at a much slower rate compared to tumors produced by control cells ( Fig. 7i – k ). Collectively, these results show that TRIM15 is critical for tumorigenicity of melanoma cells. A role of TRIM15 in the survival of drug-resistant melanomas Small molecule inhibitors for oncogenic BRAF mutations, which are associated with 40–60% of melanomas as well as a significant fraction of other cancers 52 , substantially improve progression-free and overall survival 32 , 53 – 55 . However, nearly all patients develop drug resistance in a relative short period of time through diverse mechanism, each accounting for a subset of the resistant tumors 5 – 7 . An analysis of public datasets showed that compared to matched pre-treatment tumor samples, there was a statistically significant increase in TRIM15 expression across melanoma samples that initially responded to BRAF inhibitor or BRAF plus MEK inhibitors but subsequently progressed ( Extended Data Fig. 9a ) 56 , or in a subset of these treated samples ( Extended Data Fig. 9b , c ) 57 . Thus, TRIM15 upregulation might contribute to drug resistance, although further investigation is needed. Since the great majority of drug resistance mechanisms eventually lead to the re-activation of ERK1/2 (ref. 5 – 7 ), TRIM15 may be a valuable drug target in drug-resistant as well as drug-responsive tumors. Indeed, TRIM15 knockdown impaired adherent proliferation ( Extended Data Fig. 8g ) and tumorigenicity ( Fig. 7i – k and Extended Data Fig. 8h ) of A375 cells to an extent similar to that achieved by a high dose of PLX4032. TRIM15 knockdown also synergized with PLX4032 treatment, reducing adherent proliferation in culture and tumor growth in xenografted animals in a manner that was much stronger than either treatment alone ( Fig. 7i – k and Extended Data Fig. 8h ). To evaluate the role of TRIM15 in BRAF V600E inhibitor-resistant melanomas, we continuously cultured A375 cells in the presence of PLX4032 and obtained PLX4032-resistant cells (A375R; Extended Data Fig. 8i ), where ERK1/2 were re-activated ( Fig. 7l ). Knocking down TRIM15 in A375R cells inhibited ERK1/2 activation ( Fig. 7m ) and suppressed cell proliferation ( Fig. 7n and Extended Data Fig. 8j , k ). We also used a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line, WM3960, which was established from a primary melanoma that harbored both BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K and was resistant to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK-2118436) and the MEK inhibitor trametinib 58 . Depleting TRIM15 in WM3960 cells markedly reduced ERK1/2 activation ( Fig. 7o ). It also strongly inhibited tumorigenicity in animals ( Fig. 7p , q ). These results suggest that TRIM15 is important for the survival of therapeutic-resistant melanomas. TRIM15/CYLD expression in melanoma specimens We performed an immunohistochemical analysis of human melanoma specimens, and observed that ERK1/2 activity positively correlated with TRIM15 protein levels and inversely correlated CYLD protein levels ( Fig. 8a – c ). An analysis of public databases revealed that the TRIM15 gene was amplified in melanoma and other tumors ( Extended Data Fig. 9d ). TRIM15 transcript was also significantly up-regulated in the highly metastatic derivatives of A375 cells compared to the poorly metastatic parental cells ( Fig. 8d ) 59 . Furthermore, high expression of TRIM15 or its target BCL2 correlated with poor survival of melanoma patients ( Fig. 8e , f ). In contrast, CYLD transcript was markedly decreased in highly metastatic derivatives of A375 cells ( Fig. 8g ). CYLD transcript was also lower in benign nevi and malignant melanoma compared to normal skin ( Fig. 8h and Extended Data Fig. 9e ) 60 . Moreover, low expression of CYLD correlated with poor survival in melanoma patients ( Fig. 8i and Extended Data Fig. 9f ). Thus, high TRIM15 expression and low CYLD expression may contribute to melanoma initiation and progression. Discussion The ERK pathway is the preeminent mitogenic pathway in mammalian cells, normal or malignant. The signaling transduction through the ERK and other MAPK pathways has largely been investigated in the context of protein phosphorylation. The current study shows that K63 ubiquitination is critical for the ERK1/2 activation. This posttranslational modification, which is dynamically regulated by TRIM15 and CYLD, facilitates the interaction of ERK with MEK. Thus, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that governs MAPK activity and permits the efficiency and specificity of signal transmission within MAPK cascades. There is a paucity of information on the cellular function of TRIM15 except for a role in focal adhesion 61 . We find that TRIM15 appears to be the main ubiquitin E3 ligase for ERK1/2. In its absence, K63 ubiquitination on ERK1/2 is barely detectable even upon mitogenic stimulation. ERK1 and ERK2 may be the principal targets of TRIM15 for cell proliferation, as the proliferative defects caused by TRIM15 loss can be largely restored by a constitutively-active form of ERK1. In contrast, CYLD has been implicated in various cellular processes including inflammation, spermatogenesis, bone homeostasis, cell cycle progression, and cell migration, and its deregulation contributes to tumor formation 46 . Our results suggest that these diverse functions of CYLD may be attributable in part to its role the ERK pathway, in addition to the NF-κB pathway. The ERK pathway is one of the most commonly mutated pathways in human tumors 4 . TRIM15 is required for the growth of both drug-responsive and -resistant melanoma cells, and its upregulation may correlate with ERK activation in melanoma specimens. These observations suggest a potential utility of TRIM15 as a drug target and a prognostic marker for various tumors driven by a hyperactive ERK pathway. Methods Plasmids.

Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), and cells were grown in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. To generate PLX4032-resistant melanoma A375 cells, parental A375 cells were seeded at very low density and exposed to 2 μM PLX4032 (Adooq). After approximately 2 months of continuous PLX4032 exposure, PLX4032-resistant cells (A375R) were obtained. PLX4032-sensitive and resistant A375 cells were exposed to increasing doses of PLX4032 for three days. Cell viability was measured using MTT assay, and the p-ERK1/2 levels were detected by immunoblotting. Lentiviral vectors and stable cell lines. For production of lentiviral vectors, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with each lentiviral plasmid together with the helper plasmids. For generating TRIM15 lentiviral vectors, Gag, Rev, and VSVG were used. For generating shRNA lentiviral or Cas9-sgRNA lentiviral vectors, DR8.91 and VSVG were used. The virus-containing medium were harvested 72 h after transfection, centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min, filtered through 0.45 μm filters (Millipore), and concentrated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 h. Cells were infected with the concentrated lentiviral particles in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) for 20–24 h and selected with appropriate antibiotics for one week. Transient and stable RNAi knockdown. For transient knockdown, cells were transfected with siRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA sequences were: negative control: 5’-GGUUAAUCGCGUAUAAUACGCGUAT-3’, CYLD#1: 5’-GGTACAAGATTGTTACTTCTATCAA-3’, CYLD#2: 5’-GGATGTTTATCATACTGTTTCTCTG-3’, CYLD#3: 5’-GGTTCATCCAGTCATAATAAACCAA-3’, TRIM15 siRNA mix (TRM15#1: 5’-AGATTGAGGATGTAAAGTGTCAAGA-3’, TRIM15#2: 5’-GATCCGTGATTTCCACAGGAAAATA-3’, and TRIM15#3: 5’-GATTCAGGGGTCATCACTCTGGACC-3’).

SK-MEL-173 and HEK293T cells were infected with lentiCRISPR v2-Blast-sgTRIM15 viral vectors and selected in the presence of 10 μg/ml of blasticidin. Protein expression and purification. To generate proteins from bacteria, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing GST, GST-ERK1, GST-ERK1 2KR , GST-ERK1 2DN , and GST-ELK-1 (307–428) plasmids were induced for protein expression using 0.5 mM isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37 °C for 4–6 h. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF) and sonicated. After centrifugation lysates were incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 4 h or overnight. The resin was washed with lysis buffer plus 300 mM NaCl for three times followed by PBS for two times. The proteins immobilized on Glutathione Sepharose beads were verified by SDS-PAGE and aliquoted to store at −80 °C. To perform in vitro kinase assay, GST-ELK-1 (307–428) protein was eluted using 20 mM reduced glutathione in buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). To purify Flag-tagged ERK1, ERK2, TRIM15, TRIM15 4A , CYLD, and CYLD 4A from mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were transfected with the corresponding plasmids, and the proteins were purified using anti-Flag (M2) beads as previously described 63 64 . To purify Flag-ERK1 proteins that were partially (Flag-ERK1 Ub ) or nearly-completely (Flag-ERK1-Ub) conjugated to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-ERK1, HA-TRIM15, and His-Ub. Flag-ERK1 Ub was purified as for Flag-ERK1. Flag-ERK1-Ub, cells were lysed in buffer (250 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.5% Triton, pH 8.0). Ubiquitinated proteins in the supernatant were purified with Ni-NTA beads. Eluted proteins were purified with anti-Flag M2 beads and eluted with 3xFlag peptides. Immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation assay. For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mM DTT, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [Thermo Scientific]) and sonicated at 20% amplitude for 20 sec (10 sec on, 10 sec off) on ice. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE after measuring protein concentration by Bradford protein assays (Bio-Rad). For co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. In vivo ubiquitination assay. Ubiquitination was detected by denaturing immunoprecipitation (d-IP). Cells were lysed in SDS-denaturing buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min. Cell lysates were then diluted 10 to 40-fold in native lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag mAb M2 beads (for Flag-tagged proteins), anti-ERK1/2 antibody-conjugated beads (for endogenous ERK1/2), or rabbit IgG-conjugated beads at 4 °C for 4 h or overnight. The immunocomplexes were washed 3 times with native lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibody for ubiquitin or K63-linkage ubiquitin. For cells transfected with 6xHis-ubiquitin, ubiquitination was also detected by Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen). For this, cells were lysed with guanidine denaturing buffer (6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). After sonication, the whole cell extracts were incubated with nickel beads and washed, and the pulldown proteins were analyzed by immunoblot. In vitro ubiquitination assay. In vitro ubiquitination of ERK1 or ERK1 2KR was performed at 37 °C for 60 min in 50 μL reaction buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM DTT) which contains purified Flag-ERK1 or ERK1 2KR protein (5 μM), UBE1 (100 nM, Boston Biochem), UbcH13/Uev1a (1 μΜ, Boston Biochem), His-ubiquitin or His-ubiquitin K63R (100 μΜ, Boston Biochem), Flag-TRIM15 (2 μM) and Mg 2+ -ATP (10 mM, Sigma). The reaction mixtures were heated with addition of SDS-loading buffer at 95 °C for 10 min and then diluted with buffer (0.05% Triton, 0.1 M Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) for purification of ubiquitinated ERK1 or ERK1 2KR by Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen). Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot. Sucrose-gradient centrifugation analysis. HEK293T cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with IGF1 (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were harvested in pre-cold PBS on ice, pelleted, and lysed in lysis buffer (30 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mM sodium fluoride, 3mM sodium ortho-vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail) for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged, and supernatant was layered on top of a 10–50% (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%) sucrose gradient in buffer containing 30 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% Triton X-100, 25 mM sodium fluoride, 3 mM sodium ortho-vanadate, and protease inhibitors. Ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm and 4 °C for 4 h. Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry proteomics resources and services are provided by the Quantitative Proteomics Resource Core at the University of Pennsylvania. To prepare for protein samples, the protein bands from SDS-PAGE were de-stained with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (50:50), and reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol/100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for over 60 min in 52 °C. The bands were alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate at RT for 1 h in the dark. The proteins in the gel bands were digested by incubation with trypsin for overnight. The supernatant was removed and kept in fresh tubes. Additional peptides were extracted from the gel by adding 50 μL of 50% acetonitrile and 1% TFA and shaking for 10 min. The supernatants were combined and dried. The dried samples were reconstituted by 0.1% formic acid. Desalted peptides were analyzed on a Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Scientific) attached to an Ultimate 300 nano UPLC system (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were eluted with a 25 min gradient from 2% to 32% ACN and to 98% ACN over 5 min in 0.1% formic acid. Data dependent acquisition mode with a dynamic exclusion of 45 second was enabled. One full MS scan was collected with scan range of 350 to 1200 m/z, resolution of 70 K, maximum injection time of 50 ms and AGC of 1e6. Then, a series of MS2 scans were acquired for the most abundant ions from the MS1 scan (top 15). Ions were filtered with charge 2–5. An isolation window of 1.40m/z was used with quadruple isolation mode. Ions were fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with collision energy of 28%. Orbitrap detection was used with, resolution of 35 K, maximum injection time of 54 ms and AGC of 5e4. Database search criteria were as follows: taxonomy Homo sapiens, carboxyamidomethylated (+57 Da) at cysteine residues for fixed modifications, oxidized at methionine (+16 Da) residues, glygly(+114 Da) at lysine residues for variable modifications, two maximum allowed missed cleavage, 10 ppm MS tolerance, a 0.02-Da MS/MS tolerance. Only peptides resulting from trypsin digestion were considered. The target-decoy approach was used to filter the search results, in which the false discovery rate was less than 1% at the peptide and protein level. In vitro deubiquitination assay. K63-ubiquitinated ERK1 was purified as described above. To purify CYLD and CYLD CA , HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-CYLD or Flag-CYLD CA . Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and 1 mM DTT, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [Thermo Scientific]). Flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag (M2) beads, and eluted with 3xFlag peptide. For in vitro deubiquitination assays, ubiquitinated ERK1 or Di-ubiquitin was incubated with CYLD or CYLD mutants in a deubiquitination buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM DTT). Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1 h, and terminated by 2x SDS loading buffer. Flag-ERK1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-ERK1 antibody and analyzed by Western blot. GST pull-down assay. Flag-tagged TRIM15, TRIM15 4A , CYLD, and CYLD 4A purified from HEK293T cells were incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) bound with bacterially expressed GST or GST fusion proteins in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer. Input and the pull-down samples were analyzed by immunoblot. Cell viability and colony formation assays. Cell proliferation and viability were detected by MTT assay and crystal violet assay. For MTT assay, cells (1–3×10 3 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates in DMEM complete medium. From the second day, 20 μL MTT (5 mg/ml) was added into each well for incubation at 37 °C for an additional 4 h, and culture media were discarded afterwards. DMSO (150 μL) was then added into the wells to dissolve the purple precipitate, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. All experimental data were a result of three to four replicates. The results were graphically presented using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software). For crystal violet assay, cells (2×10 3 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plate in DMEM complete medium. Medium with or without indicated drugs was changed every two days. Cells were stained with crystal violet (0.1% in 20% methanol) at room temperature for 30 min. Colony formation was analyzed by crystal violet assay with 500–1000 cells/well in 6-well plates. Soft agar assay. 1 × 10 3 cells were mixed with culture medium containing 0.3% agar and plated on top of base agar (0.6%) that were pre-plated at 1.5 ml/well in 6-well plates. The plate was maintained at room temperature for 15 min to solidify and incubated at 37 °C incubator. After 1 to 2 weeks, colonies were observed and stained with crystal violet (0.1% in 20% methanol). All experiments were performed in triplicates. The number of colonies was counted by ImageJ. Dual luciferase reporter assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plate. NF-κB reporter construct (50 ng) and Renilla (5 ng) were applied in each well. Other plasmids or empty vectors were co-transfected and the amount of plasmid each well is 150 ng. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in native lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase activity was assayed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (E-1910, Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ELISA assay. The level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was tested by a phospho-ERK1/2 (pT202/Y204) ELISA Kit (JLCa3420, JKBio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 50 ng proteins were used to monitor the level of phospho-ERK1. The level of phospho-ERK1 was calculated based on the curve produced with standard samples. In vitro kinase assay. Flag-ERK proteins immobilized on beads, as described above, were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with kinase buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT), and pre-incubated with kinase buffer containing 2 mM MnCl 2 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. GST-ELK-1 (a.a. 307–428) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2x SDS loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibody against ELK-1 phosphorylated at S383. GST-ELK-1 (307–428) was detected by Ponceau S staining. In vivo experiments and drug administration. Male athymic nude mice at 5–6 weeks of age (Jackson Laboratory) were used for tumor xenograft model. Mice were housed in a light/dark cycle of 12 h, in a pathogen free, temperature- and humidity-controlled room (22 °C and 45–55%, respectively). A375 cells expressing shCtrl or shTRIM15 (1×10 6 each) were suspended in 100 μL 1:1 DMEM and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and subcutaneously implanted in the right flank of each mouse. Treatment begun within several days after tumor was observed. PLX4032 was dissolved by solvents (4% DMSO + 30% PEG + 5% Tween 80 + ddH 2 O). Mice (shCtrl, N=10; shTRIM15, N=10) were randomly separated into four groups, namely shCtrl + solvents (N=5), shTRIM15 + solvents (N=5), shCtrl + PLX4032 (N=5), and shTRIM15 + PLX4032 (N=5). Mice were administrated by intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/Kg PLX4032 once a day. The tumor size was measured every three days by digital caliper, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula: volume = length × width 2 /2. WM3960 cells expressing shCtrl or shTRIM15 (4×10 6 each) were suspended in 100 μL 1:1 Tu2% medium and Matrigel and subcutaneously implanted in the right flank of each mouse (N=6). At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized, and tumors were dissected and weighed. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Immunohistochemistry. A melanoma tissue array including 32 cases of primary melanoma and 16 metastatic melanoma (ME483a, US Biomax) was baked at 60 °C for 2 h followed by deparaffinization with Xylenes and rehydration through ethanol gradient. For the IHC staining of TRIM15 and CYLD, antigen retrieval was performed by heating at 95 °C in citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 8.5) for 30 min and cooling down to room temperature. Tissue slides were then analyzed with the Double Staining Polymer Kit (MP-7724, Vector Laboratories). Antibodies against TRIM15 (Invitrogen, 1:100) and CYLD (Proteintech, 1:50) were incubated with the sections overnight at 4 °C. IHC staining was shown as ImmPACT Vector Red (magenta). For IHC staining of phosphor-ERK1/2, antigen retrieval was performed by heating slides in a microwave submersed in citrate unmasking solution (14746, Cell Signaling) until boiling and then keeping at a sub-boiling temperature for 10 min. Cool slides to room temperature and incubate sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Blocked sections were incubated with p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, 1:200) at 4 °C overnight. Sections were incubated with SignalStain Boost IHC Detection Reagent (8114, Cell Signaling) at room temperature for 30 min. After washing, 400 μL Signal Stain DAB (mix 30 μL Signal DAB Chromogen Concentrate with 1 ml Signal DAB Diluent) (8059, Cell Signaling) was applied to the sections. Sections were then dehydrated, cleared in xylene and mounted on slides using DPX mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Science). Tissues were visualized and captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Revolve, Echo Laboratories). Immunohistochemical staining intensity scores were indicated as: negative (0), weak staining (1), moderate staining (2) and strong staining (3) and the extent of stained cells were indicated as: 0%= 0, 1–24% = 1, 25–49% = 2, 50–74% = 3, 75–100% = 4. The final scores were defined by multiplying the intensity scores with the scores of the extent of stained cells (0–12). Melanoma gene expression database analysis. CYLD and TRIM15 mRNA expression data (GEO DataSets: GSE61992 (ref. 56 ), GSE50509 (ref. 57 ), GSE3189 (ref. 60 ), and GSE7929 (ref. 59 )) were downloaded from NCBI and analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.

  "plain_text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 represent the foremost mitogenic pathway in mammalian cells, and their dysregulation drives tumorigenesis and confers therapeutic resistance. ERK1/2 are known to be activated by MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-mediated phosphorylation. Here we show that ERK1/2 are also modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. We identify the tripartite motif-containing protein TRIM15 as a ubiquitin ligase, and the tumor suppressor CYLD as a deubiquitinase, for ERKs. TRIM15 and CYLD regulate ERK ubiquitination at defined lysine residues via mutually exclusive interactions as well as opposing activities. K63-linked polyubiquitination enhances ERK interaction with and activation by MEK. Down-regulation of TRIM15 inhibits growth of both drug-responsive and -resistant melanomas. Moreover, high TRIM15 expression and low CYLD expression are associated with poor prognosis of melanoma patients. These findings define a role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in the ERK signaling pathway and suggest a potential target for cancer therapy."
