    "abstract_text": "Calnexin was initially identified as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) type I integral membrane protein, phosphorylated on its cytosolic domain by ER-associated protein kinases. Although the role of the ER luminal domain of calnexin has been established as a constituent of the molecular chaperone machinery of the ER, less is known about the role of the cytosolic phosphorylation of calnexin. Analysis by two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps revealed that calnexin was in vitro phosphorylated in isolated microsomes by casein kinase 2 (CK2) and extracellular-signal regulated kinase-1 (ERK-1) at sites corresponding to those for in vivo phosphorylation. In canine pancreatic microsomes, synergistic phosphorylation by CK2 and ERK-1 led to increased association of calnexin with membrane-bound ribosomes. In vivo, calnexin-associated ERK-1 activity was identified by co-immunoprecipitation. This activity was abolished in cells expressing a dominant-negative MEK-1. Activation of ERK-1 in cells by addition of serum led to a 4-fold increase in ribosome-associated calnexin over unstimulated cells. Taken together with studies revealing calnexin association with CK2 and ERK-1, a model is proposed whereby phosphorylation of calnexin leads to a potential increase in glycoprotein folding close to the translocon.",
