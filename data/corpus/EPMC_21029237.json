    "abstract_text": "Double-stranded RNA dependent kinase (PKR) is a pro-apoptotic kinase that controls protein translation. Previous studies revealed that activated PKR is increased in brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glycogen Synthase Kinase A\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) is responsible for tau phosphorylation and controls several cellular functions also including apoptosis. The goal of this work was to determine if PKR could concurrently trigger GSK-3\u03b2 activation, tau phosphorylation and apoptosis. In AD brains, both activated kinases co-localize with phosphorylated tau in neurons. In SH-SY5Y cell cultures, tunicamycin and A\u03b2(1-42) activate PKR, GSK-3\u03b2 and induce tau phosphorylation and all these processes are attenuated by PKR inhibitors or PKR siRNA. Our results demonstrate that neuronal PKR co-localizes with GSK-3\u03b2 and tau in AD brains and is able to modulate GSK-3\u03b2 activation, tau phosphorylation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells exposed to tunicamycin or A\u03b2. PKR could represent a crucial signaling point relaying stress signals to neuronal pathways leading to cellular degeneration in AD.",
