  "abstract_text": "Androgen insensitivity syndromes are due to defects in the androgen receptor gene. In this study, we analyzed the androgen receptor gene in four cases with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. In patient 1, one substitutional mutation [arginine (codon CGC) to cysteine (codon TGC) at position 774] of exon F was identified. This position was located in the hormone binding domain and appeared to be one hot spot of mutations because the mutations at the same position in several unrelated cases were reported before. In patient 2, one substitutional mutation [tyrosine (codon TAT) to cysteine (codon TGT) at position 571] of exon B was identified. This position was located in the DNA binding domain. In patients 3 and 4 (siblings), one substitutional mutation [arginine (codon CGA) to glutamine (codon CAA) at position 752] of exon E was identified. Taken together, these abnormalities might be related to the pathogenesis of complete androgen insensitivity.",
