    "abstract_text": "We analysed the CACNA1A gene, located on chromosome 19p13, in three unrelated families and one sporadic case with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA-2). In two of the families and the sporadic patient, novel truncating mutations, which disrupt the reading frame and result in a premature stop of the CACNA1A protein, were identified in exons 14, 16 and 26. In the remaining family, a novel missense mutation (H253Y) was found. Of the twenty two EA-2 mutations identified thus far, including those of the present study, seventeen are truncating mutations and five are missense mutations, all resulting in an EA-2 clinical phenotype.",
