  "abstract_text": "The discovery and optimization of a series of pyrrolopyrimidine based protein kinase B (Pkb/Akt) inhibitors discovered via HTS and structure based drug design is reported. The compounds demonstrate potent inhibition of all three Akt isoforms and knockdown of phospho-PRAS40 levels in LNCaP cells and tumor xenografts.",
