  "abstract_text": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are two major inflammatory mediators. Here we show that iNOS specifically binds to COX-2 and S-nitrosylates it, enhancing COX-2 catalytic activity. Selectively disrupting iNOS-COX-2 binding prevented NO-mediated activation of COX-2. This synergistic molecular interaction between two inflammatory systems may inform the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.",
