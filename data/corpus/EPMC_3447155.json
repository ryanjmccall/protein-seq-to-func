  "abstract_text": "Tryptic peptides were isolated from human insulin receptor (1.8 nmol) by sequential reverse-phase HPLC on SynChropak RP-C8 and Vydac C-18. Nearly 20 peptides were analyzed for amino acid composition, which revealed that the yield of tryptic peptides averaged 300 pmol. By gas-phase microsequencing five peptides were sequenced. N-acetylglucosamine was found in two peptides. These data are compared with the amino acid sequence of the insulin receptor deduced from cloned cDNA encoding for human insulin receptor.",
