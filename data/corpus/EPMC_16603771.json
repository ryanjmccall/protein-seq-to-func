  "abstract_text": "The WSTF (Williams syndrome transcription factor) protein is involved in vitamin D-mediated transcription and replication as a component of two distinct ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, WINAC and WICH, respectively. We show here that the WICH complex (WSTF-SNF2h) interacts with several nuclear proteins as follows: Sf3b155/SAP155, RNA helicase II/Gualpha, Myb-binding protein 1a, CSB, the proto-oncogene Dek, and nuclear myosin 1 in a large 3-MDa assembly, B-WICH, during active transcription. B-WICH also contains RNAs, 45 S rRNA, 5 S rRNA, 7SL RNA, and traces of the U2 small nuclear RNA. The core proteins, WSTF, SNF2h, and nuclear myosin 1, are associated with the RNA polymerase III genes 5 S rRNA genes and 7SL, and post-transcriptional silencing of WSTF reduces the levels of these transcripts. Our results show that a WSTF-SNF2h assembly is involved in RNA polymerase III transcription, and we suggest that WSTF-SNF2h-NM1 forms a platform in transcription while providing chromatin remodeling.",
