  "abstract_text": "Carcinogenesis involves multiple steps and pathways with functional alterations in a variety of genes. There is accumulating evidence that a deficiency of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 leads to DNA repair defects, genomic instability, failure of induction of cell death and modulation of gene transcription. PARP-1 also supports the growth of tumor cells in certain situations. Genetic analyses of the PARP-1 gene have demonstrated alterations in neoplasms, and a mutation affecting the conserved amino acid E251 in germ cell tumors, as well as an association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism V762A with risk of prostate cancer. Recent development of a selective inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), the enzyme primarily responsible for degradation of poly(ADP-ribose), and PARG-deficient animals should facilitate studies of the relationship of poly(ADP-ribose) with carcinogenesis. Inhibitors of PARP have also suggested roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, and a promoter haplotype of PARP-1 confers a higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Further analysis of PARP-1, PARG and other PARP family genes should extend our understanding of the pathogenesis of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, there is potential for sensitization to chemo- and radiation therapy of cancers as well as the treatment of autoimmune disease with development of stronger PARP inhibitors.",
