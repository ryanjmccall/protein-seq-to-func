    "abstract_text": "Stimulation of the prolactin receptor (PRLR), a member of the cytokine/growth hormone receptor family, results in activation of the associated Jak2 tyrosine kinase and downstream signaling pathways. We report that PTP1D, a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase containing two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, physically associates with the PRLR-Jak2 complex and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with prolactin. The formation of the trimeric PRLR-Jak2-PTP1D complex is critical for transmission of a lactogenic signal, while PTP1D phosphorylation is necessary, but not sufficient. The dominant negative inhibitory effect of a phosphatase-deficient mutant on expression of a beta-casein promoter-controlled reporter gene is evidence for an essential role of fully functional PTP1D in the regulation of milk protein gene transcription.",
