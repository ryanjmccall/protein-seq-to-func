    "abstract_text": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Telomerase is considered currently as a hallmark of cancer, and its inhibition is expected to become an important anticancer modality. In contrast to abundant data concerning the effect of cytotoxic drugs on telomerase activity (TA), there is scant information on the effect of radiation on telomerase. The mechanism of telomerase regulation by irradiation has never been evaluated in detail. In the present study, we investigated the effect of radiation on TA and its regulation in cancer cells.<h4>Experimental design</h4>The effect of various radiation doses on TA in several malignant and nonmalignant cell lines was evaluated. All malignant cells exhibited similar telomerase response to radiation and its regulation was assessed at transcriptional and post-translational levels in K562 cells. Next step was the evaluation of the upstream signaling pathways leading to changes in TA using kinetics and specific inhibitors.<h4>Results</h4>Radiation up-regulated TA in dose-dependent manner only in cancer cells. Telomerase was activated by phosphorylation by Akt and by cytoplasmic-nuclear shift. Transcriptional processes were not involved in TA. This telomerase regulation is mediated by Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. The canonical membrane effectors of irradiation (epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor, and Ca2+ influx) were not involved in this process.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Radiation up-regulates telomerase activity specifically in cancer cells. This study adds to accumulating evidence pointing to post-translational level as important mode of telomerase regulation. Telomerase activation due to radiation may be detrimental in treatment of cancer. Data described in this study may add to future interventions aiming at inhibition of telomerase activation during irradiation.",
