  "abstract_text": "The obese (ob) gene has been identified through a positional cloning approach; the mutation of this gene causes marked hereditary obesity and diabetes mellitus in mice. We report here the isolation and characterization of the human ob gene. Southern blot analysis demonstrated a single copy of the ob gene in the human genome. The human ob gene spanned approximately 20 kilobases (kb) and contained three exons separated by two introns. The first intron, approximately 10.6 kb in size, occurred in the 5'-untranslated region, 29 base pair (bp) upstream of the ATG start codon. The second intron of 2.3 kb in size was located at glutamine +49. By rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends, the transcription initiation sites were mapped 54-57 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. The 172-bp 5'-flanking region of the human ob gene contained a TATA box-like sequence and several cis-acting regulatory elements (three copies of GC boxes, an AP-2-binding site, and a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-binding site). By the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique, the ob gene was assigned to human chromosome 7q31.3. This study should establish the genetic basis for ob gene research in humans, thereby leading to the better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the ob gene.",
