    "abstract_text": "Evi-1 encodes a nuclear protein involved in leukemic transformation of hematopoietic cells. Evi-1 possesses two sets of zinc finger motifs separated into two domains, and its characteristics as a transcriptional regulator have been described. Here we show that Evi-1 acts as an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a class of mitogen-activated protein kinases implicated in stress responses of cells. Evi-1 physically interacts with JNK, although it does not affect its phosphorylation. This interaction is required for inhibition of JNK. Evi-1 protects cells from stress-induced cell death with dependence on the ability to inhibit JNK. These results reveal a novel function of Evi-1, which provides evidence for inhibition of JNK by a nuclear oncogene product. Evi-1 blocks cell death by selectively inhibiting JNK, thereby contributing to oncogenic transformation of cells.",
