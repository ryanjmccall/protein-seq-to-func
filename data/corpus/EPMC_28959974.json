HR is inhibited in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but both pathways are active in S and G2 phases. Why cNHEJ does not always outcompete HR in S and G2 phases has been unclear. Here we show that CYREN is a cell cycle specific inhibitor of cNHEJ. CYREN suppression allows cNHEJ at telomeres and intrachromosomal breaks during S and G2 phases, while cells lacking CYREN accumulate chromosomal aberrations upon damage induction, specifically outside G1 phase. CYREN acts by binding to the Ku70/80 heterodimer and preferentially inhibits cNHEJ at breaks with overhangs by protecting them. We therefore propose that CYREN is a direct cell cycle inhibitor of cNHEJ, thereby promoting error free repair by HR in cell cycle phases where sister chromatids are present. The cNHEJ machinery recognizes breaks, indiscriminately joins them and is therefore potentially genotoxic 1 . HR relies on the generation of 3’ overhangs, which invade homologous sister chromatids to promote error free break repair 2 . Choice between HR and cNHEJ depends primarily on the cell cycle stage and the nature of the break. During G1 phase HR is inactivated, and cNHEJ is dominant, but during S and G2 phases, when sister chromatids are available, cNHEJ and HR compete 3 . While the inhibition of HR during G1 is well understood, it is unclear why the abundant cNHEJ machinery does not dominate in S and G2, pointing at an active cNHEJ suppressor mechanism during and after replication. Similarly, fusions of deprotected telomeres, which occur through cNHEJ exclusively, are restricted to G1 4 , 5 . End resection, which promotes HR, is inhibited by RIF1 and 53BP1 during G1, thereby restricting HR activity to S/G2 6 – 8 . During S/G2, when both pathways are active 9 , end-resection by CtIP is activated, which can inhibit cNHEJ 10 . However, it is unclear how cNHEJ is restricted in S and G2 to allow resection and commencement of HR for error-free repair of lesions. CYREN (Cell cYcle REgulator of NHEJ) was originally identified as potential modulator of retroviral infection 11 . Later, the alternatively spliced isoform CYREN-2 was found as short open reading frame translated polypeptide and to interact with the Ku70/80 heterodimer 12 . We therefore tested the role of CYREN in cNHEJ and found it to be a cell cycle regulator of cNHEJ. TRF2 is the main telomere protection factor by stabilizing the t-loop and inhibiting the ATM kinase and RNF168 13 – 15 . Depletion of TRF2 leads to ATM activation 16 and subsequent activation of cNHEJ, leading to chromosome end-to-end fusions 17 , while HR and alternative NHEJ (altNHEJ) remain inhibited by shelterin and Ku70/80 18 – 20 . Chromosome fusions prior to replication occur between the single chromatids of two chromosomes, leading to chromosome-type fusions after replication, where both sister chromatids are fused. When fusions occur after replication, only one sister chromatid is engaged in the fusion, leading to chromatid-type fusions ( Figure 1a ). Chromosomes fused as a result of TRF2 loss display as chromosome-type fusions during metaphase, demonstrating that the fusion process is restricted to G1 of the cell cycle and suppressed during S and G2 4 , 5 , 21 , 22 . The emergence of chromatid type fusion signifies a derepression of cNHEJ in S and G2 ( Figure 1a ), representing a powerful system to investigate DSB repair pathway choice. To study the role of CYREN in cNHEJ, we generated HT1080 6TG cells with three stably integrated inducible shRNAs targeting CYREN (shCYREN#A,B,C), which were induced after TRF2 depletion followed by metaphase analysis ( Extended data Figure 1a-c , Extended data Figure 10 ). Depletion of TRF2 alone led to chromosome type G1 fusions, while chromatid-type fusions were rare ( Figure 1b-c , Extended data Figure 1d-e ). Overall chromosome-type telomere fusion frequency was unaltered by CYREN depletion ( Figure 1c , Extended data Figure 1d-e, g ), indicating that CYREN is not part of the cNHEJ machinery. Instead, depletion of CYREN and TRF2 led to a five-fold increase in chromatid-type fusions ( Figure 1b-c , Extended data Figure 1d-e, g ), suggesting that CYREN could suppress cNHEJ in S and G2 at deprotected telomeres. Sister telomere associations were not increased ( Extended data Figure 1f-g ) and cell cycle dynamics were not perturbed by shRNA treatment ( Figure 1d ). Untransformed IMR90+E6E7 fibroblasts reacted comparably ( Extended data Figure 2a-d ). CYREN depletion did not lead to chromatid-type fusions at intact telomeres, indicating that CYREN itself does not play a role in end protection ( Figure 1b-c , Extended data Figure 2d-e ). Chromosome-Oriented FISH on CYREN and TRF2 co-depleted cells found no bias in the type of chromatid involved in the chromatid-type fusions, ruling out that the observed fusions are a result of unprocessed leading strand overhangs 23 , 24 ( Extended data Figure 3a-b ). To determine whether the fusions were the result of cNHEJ or altNHEJ activation, we depleted ATM, Ligase 4, DNA-PKcs and Ligase 3 in TRF2-suppressed CYREN wild type and knockout cells ( Extended data Figure 3c-d ). Only ATM, Ligase 4 or DNA-PKcs depletion suppressed both chromosome- and chromatid-type fusions, indicating that CYREN regulates cNHEJ, not altNHEJ ( Figure 1e ). ATM, DNA-PKcs or PARP inhibitors 25 – 27 yielded comparable results, while inhibition of RAD51 28 had no effect, excluding that CYREN controls HR ( Extended data Figure 3e-f ). ATM and DNA-PKcs inhibition for 48 hours suppressed both chromosome- and chromatid-type fusions, but only the chromatid-type fusions were suppressed when inhibition occurred during S and G2 phases, while inhibition during G2 had an intermediate effect ( Figure 1f ), confirming that CYREN inhibits cNHEJ in S and G2 phase at deprotected telomeres. To demonstrate that CYREN is a genome-wide regulator of DSB repair pathway choice, we first tested the effects of CYREN deletion on the repair of irradiation-induced intrachromosomal breaks. While three synchronized CYREN wt and CYREN KO clones ( Extended data Figure 10 ) accumulated rearrangements or bridges after irradiation in G1, cells lacking CYREN amassed significantly more abnormalities when irradiated during and after replication ( Figure 2 a-b , Extended data Figure 4 a-b ), pointing at a role of CYREN at intrachromosomal breaks in S and G2. We then designed an in vivo fluorescence-based reporter system that allows the quantitative comparison of cNHEJ and alt-NHEJ versus HR in the same cells through the repair of two inverted ISce1 cuts. Repair through NHEJ or HR leads to GFP or mCherry expression, respectively, while transfection efficiency was controlled using BFP expression from the repair donor cassette ( Figure 2c , Extended data Figure 4c-d , Extended data Figure 10 ). We confirmed that all isolated reporter clones ( Extended data Figure 4e ) followed the same cell cycle kinetics ( Extended data Figure 4e ) and analysed the outcome of repair by flow cytometry. The CYREN knockout clones utilized NHEJ significantly more frequently than the wild type clones, while HR was significantly reduced in the same cells ( Figure 2d ). CYREN depletion did not lead to the formation of radial chromosomes, or to an increase in radials in cells lacking Brca1 , or a decrease in survival ( Extended data Figure 5a-c ), arguing against the role of CYREN in replication-induced DSB repair pathway, where HR is dominant. As a result of alternative splicing of C7orf49, three isoforms of CYREN are generated ( Figure 3a ), of which isoforms 1 and 2 were found to bind to Ku70/80 12 . We expressed the Flag-tagged isoforms, depleted TRF2 and suppressed endogenous CYREN by targeting the 3’ UTR of C7orf49 ( Extended data Figure 6a-b ). 3’ UTR siCYREN increased chromatid-type fusions in control cells or cells expressing CYREN-3, but CYREN-1 or CYREN-2 rescued the phenotype ( Figure 3b ), indicating that they inhibit cNHEJ. To verify the endogenous expression levels of the isoforms we inserted a 3xFLAG tag at the N-terminus of CYREN-1 and 2 and the C-terminus of CYREN 1 and 3 ( Extended data Figure 6c-h , Extended data Figure 10 ). CYREN-1 was six to seven times more abundant than CYREN-2 ( Extended data Figure 6e ), CYREN-3 expression was not detectable ( Extended data Figure 6h ) and the siCYREN approach indeed targeted endogenous CYREN ( Extended data Figure 6i ). We therefore focused on CYREN-1. To identify the CYREN-1-Ku interaction domain, we incubated a CYREN-1 peptide array with recombinant Ku70/80 ( Extended data Figure 7a ). Ku70/80 bound to several peptides on the N-terminus of CYREN-1, a region that is lacking in isoform 3. Alanine mutagenesis, followed by co-immunoprecipitation of Ku70/80 with mutated CYREN-1, identified R11, P14 and W16 as the precise interaction domain ( Figure 3c , Extended data Figure 7b ). These highly conserved residues ( Extended data Figure 7c ) are part of the Ku-binding motif (KBM), previously also described in APLF, CYREN and WRN and shown to interact with a hydrophobic pocket in the vWA domain of Ku80 29 . We incubated a synthetic UV-crosslinkable BPA-BIO-CYREN peptide with cell lysate, followed by UV crosslinking and biotin pulldown, and confirmed the direct CYREN KBM-Ku80 interaction ( Extended data Figure 7d ). Co-depletion of CYREN and TRF2 again led to chromatid-type fusions, which were suppressed by exogenous expression of wild type CYREN-1 as well as CYREN-1 R11A ( Extended data Figure 7e , Figure 3d ). In contrast, expression of the CYREN-1 P14A and CYREN-1 W16A mutants, as well as the triple mutant CYREN-1 RPW-AAA , failed to rescue the chromatid-type fusions ( Figure 3d ), indicating that the CYREN mediated inhibition of cNHEJ critically depends on the interaction of CYREN with Ku. Because CYREN activity is strictly restricted to S and G2, we examined the cell cycle regulation of CYREN. CYREN-1 and CYREN-2 mRNA levels, endogenous C-terminally tagged CYREN-1 or endogenous N-terminally tagged CYREN-1 and CYREN-2 proteins were not cell cycle regulated ( Figure 3e-f , Extended data Figure 7f ). In contrast, the interaction of CYREN with the Ku heterodimer was restricted to S and G2 of the cell cycle ( Figure 3g-h ), explaining the cell cycle dependency of CYREN based c-NHEJ inhibition. To understand whether CYREN has a preference for break sites with pre-existing overhangs, we generated breaks that either bear blunt ends or 5’ or 3’ overhangs of different lengths at an m-Clover-LaminA reporter ( Figure 4a , Extended data Figure 10 ). We found that although CYREN depletion did not affect the repair of blunt ends, HR was reduced at breaks with overhangs ( Figure 4b , Extended data Figure 8a ). The reduction reached up to 40% at breaks with long 3’ overhangs, suggesting that CYREN preferentially regulates cNHEJ at breaks with overhangs, consistent with the strong cNHEJ inhibition observed at telomeres. To analyse a potential role for CYREN in overhang processing during cNHEJ, we used the same reporter system without providing a HR donor. Deep sequencing and analysing the deletions at the repair junctions revealed no increased deletion frequencies at blunt ends, but the lack of CYREN led to increased deletions of the 5’ and 3’ overhangs, indicating that CYREN prevents the processing of overhangs ( Figure 4c , Extended data Figure 8b ). This phenotype was rescued by CYREN wt expression, but not by CYREN mutant that fails to interact with Ku70/80 ( Extended data Figure 8c-d ). The data suggest that CYREN protects the single stranded overhangs at break sites, thereby creating a local environment that favours HR, while preventing cNHEJ dependent repair. CYREN had previously been described as stimulator of end joining in vitro 12 . However, when we compared in vitro NHEJ activities of CYREN knockout with wild type clones, we did not observe differences ( Extended data Figure 9a ). Similarly, purified wild type CYREN or CYREN incapable of binding to Ku did not stimulate end joining activity ( Extended data Figure 9b ), leading us to the conclusion that the small differences reported previously were likely the consequences of oversaturating the reaction with recombinant protein. CYREN represents a novel class of pathway choice regulators that is not a functional part of the cNHEJ or HR machineries per se . Possibly the CYREN-Ku interaction diminishes binding of Ku to break sites with overhangs. Similarly, CYREN could compete for Ku binding with other KBM containing factors in vivo, thereby obstructing initiation of the NHEJ process and giving the resection machinery an advantage, consistent with the observation that HR is favoured when rapid end joining by NHEJ is inhibited 30 . While inhibition of HR at replication-induced breaks eventually leads to repair by cNHEJ even in S and G2, cNHEJ at telomeres remains inhibited, possibly because the overhangs of two deprotected telomeres are not cohesive and fusion depends on overhang processing, which does not apply to the cohesive overhangs induced by nickase. CYREN could therefore suppress the fusion of distal breaks bearing overhangs and prevent translocations in S and G2. Finally, understanding CYREN will permit an in-depth analysis of the cell cycle regulated Ku-CYREN interaction and the potential effects on toxicity of error prone repair, whether unleashing cNHEJ in cell cycle phases other than G1 will predispose organisms to cancer and whether deregulation of cNHEJ in S and G2 sensitizes cancer cells to genotoxic drugs.

Co-Immunoprecipitations For Alanine scan, CYREN1-FLAG was cloned in pcDNA3.1 construct and residues 9 to 46 were each mutated to an Alanine using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB). HEK293T cells were transfected with 10µl of empty vector, FLAG-tagged CYREN1 wt or mutants using Lipofectamine 2000. 24 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with Pierce IP lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche). Protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG agarose beads (clone M2, Sigma Aldrich) 1 hr at 4°C for, washed 3 times with TBS-T and eluted with 125 μg ml -1 3X FLAG peptide (Sigma Aldrich) in TBS-T 1 hr at 4°C. 2.5% of the cell total lysate and 25% of the immunoprecipitate were used for western blot analysis. For endogenous CYREN immunoprecipitations, cells were synchronized by double thymidine block and lysed in Pierce Lysis buffer 30 minutes after 2 Gy irradiation in S, G2 or G1 (respectively 4, 9 and 12.5 hours after Thymidine release). 500µg of protein lysates were incubated overnight with 2µg of rabbit anti-Flag or control IgG antibody followed by one hour incubation with 50µl of Dynabeads Protein G. Beads were washed five times in PBST and boiled in Laemli buffer. 2.5% of the cell total lysate and 25% of the immunoprecipitate were used for western blot analysis. Photo-crosslink pulldown Purified CYREN(2-24) free peptide and cross-linkable CYREN(2-24)- (p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (BPA at residue 16)-Biotin peptides were purchased from RS synthesis. 2 mg of HEK293T cell lysates were incubated 1 hr at 4ºC 100µM CYREN(2-24) free peptide (or equivalent volume of DMSO). 25-50µM CYREN(2-24)-BPA(16)-Biotin were added and incubation was pursued 2 hr, followed by UV crosslinking (Stratalinker 1800, 365nm) for one hour while maintaining samples on ice. Crosslinked samples were immunoprecipitated 1 hr at 4ºC with 100 μL of streptavidin agarose beads (Thermo FISHER), washed 3 times with TBS-T supplemented with 1% SDS at room temperature for three times, 15 min each. The samples were eluted with 2X SDS loading dye and boiled for 15 min at 95 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed. In Vitro End-Joining Assay Cells were wash three times in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in two volume of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/ 1 mM EDTA/ 1 mM DTT plus protease inhibitors), left 20 minutes on ice. Swollen cells were lysed by homogenization left 20 min on ice, and 0.5 volume of high salt buffer (50 mMTris-HCl, pH 7.5/ 1MKCl/ 2mMEDTA/ 1mM DTT) was added. Extract was centrifuged for 1 hour at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman 70.1 Ti fixed angle rotor 4°C, using polycarbonate thick wall tubes. Supernatant was dialyzed for 2-3 hours against E buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/ 0.1 M KOAc/ 20% (vol/vol) glycerol/ 0.5 mM EDTA/ 1 mM DTT] in a cassette with a membrane cutoff of 10000 Da. Snap freezing in liquid N2 and storage at -80° C. End-Joining reactions (20 μl) were carried out in 20 mM Tris - HCl (pH 7.5), 01 mM Mg(OAc) 2 , 60 mM KOAc, 2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, and 80 μg/ml BSA, 40 ng of cell extracts and 20 ng of 32P-labeled DNA. Incubation was for 90 minutes at 37°C. 32P-labeledDNAproducts were deproteinized and analyzed by electrophoresis through 0.6% agarose gels followed by autoradiography. Quantification of joining efficiency was carried out using ImageJ. Linear DNA containing 3’-overhangs was generated by cutting the plasmid pBLueScript with the endonuclease HindIII, 5’-overhangs were generated cutting with KpnI and blunt ends were generating using EcoRV. DSB Repair Reporter (DRR) The integrated DRR consists of a promoter and resistance cassette fused to a T2A peptide and two inverted ISce1 sites, followed by GFP. Intact or partially cut DRR lack GFP expression due to the presence of a STOP codon. Cells are transfected with ISce1 and an exogenous donor for HR. Repair by NHEJ or HR lead to GFP or mCherry expression. Protein alignment We used PRALINE protein alignment online software. http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/pralinewww/ Flow Cytometry For DNA repair reporter analysis, one million cells containing integrated reporter were nucleofected with 4µg of pDonor HR plasmid and 2.5µg of pCBASce plasmid. 48 hr after transfection, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 25mM HEPES pH 7; 1% (v/v) FBS; 2mM EDTA; 1x PBS and directly subjected to flow cytometry analysis. For Cas9-LMNA reporter, 0.4 million cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and transfected 24 hours later using Lipofectamine 3000 with 4µg of mClover-LMNA HR donor plasmid and 2.5 µg of a plasmid expressing Cas9 D10A and a pair of gRNAs. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 72 hours after transfection. For cell cycle analysis, cultured cells were treated 10 min with 30 µM BrdU, fixed in PBS:Ethanol 1:3 (v/v) and labeled with Alexa488 anti BrdU and Propidium Iodide. Flow cytometry was performed using MACSquant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi) and analyzed with FlowJo10. Deep Sequencing CYRENwt and KO clones were transfected as for flow cytometry analysis, except no HR donor was transfected. Four days after transfection, DNA was extracted using Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research) and a 300nt region around the break sites was amplified by PCR using KOD hot start polymerase (Millipore). Transfection efficiency was controlled by flow cytometry with the BFP tag on the Cas9 guide RNA plasmid. PCR products were sequenced by MiSeq by Retrogen. The paired end fastq files were first merged into single continuous reads using FLASH (PMID:21903629). Reads were then aligned to the amplified template reference sequence of the amplified template using global Smith-Waterman sequence alignment with the EMBOSS Needle program using default parameters (PMID: 10827456). Only sequences with an alignment score of at least 800 were considered Deletions were compiled from the alignments of correctly aligning sequences.

  "plain_text": "Classical non-homologous end joining 1 (cNHEJ) and homologous recombination 2 (HR) compete for the repair of double stranded breaks of DNA during the cell cycle. HR is inhibited in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but both pathways are active in S and G2 phases. Why cNHEJ does not always outcompete HR in S and G2 phases has been unclear. Here we show that CYREN is a cell cycle specific inhibitor of cNHEJ. CYREN suppression allows cNHEJ at telomeres and intrachromosomal breaks during S and G2 phases, while cells lacking CYREN accumulate chromosomal aberrations upon damage induction, specifically outside G1 phase. CYREN acts by binding to the Ku70/80 heterodimer and preferentially inhibits cNHEJ at breaks with overhangs by protecting them. We therefore propose that CYREN is a direct cell cycle inhibitor of cNHEJ, thereby promoting error free repair by HR in cell cycle phases where sister chromatids are present."
