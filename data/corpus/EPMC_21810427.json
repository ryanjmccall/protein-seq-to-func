  "abstract_text": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of 10 serine/threonine kinases divided into 3 subfamilies, classical, novel and atypical classes. Two PKC isozymes of the novel group, PKCε and PKCδ, have different and sometimes opposite effects. PKCε stimulates cell growth and differentiation while PKCδ is apoptotic. In the heart, they are among the most expressed PKC isozymes and they are opposed in the preconditioning process with a positive role of PKCε and an inhibiting role of PKCδ. The goal of this review is to analyze the structural differences of these 2 enzymes that may explain their different behaviors and properties.",
