    "abstract_text": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of 10 serine/threonine kinases divided into 3 subfamilies, classical, novel and atypical classes. Two PKC isozymes of the novel group, PKC\u03b5 and PKC\u03b4, have different and sometimes opposite effects. PKC\u03b5 stimulates cell growth and differentiation while PKC\u03b4 is apoptotic. In the heart, they are among the most expressed PKC isozymes and they are opposed in the preconditioning process with a positive role of PKC\u03b5 and an inhibiting role of PKC\u03b4. The goal of this review is to analyze the structural differences of these 2 enzymes that may explain their different behaviors and properties.",
