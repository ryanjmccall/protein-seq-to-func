  "abstract_text": "To understand how a signaling molecule's activities are regulated, we need insight into the processes controlling the dynamic balance between its synthesis and degradation. For the Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 signal, this information is woefully inadequate. For example, the only known cytosolic enzyme with the capacity to degrade Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 is the tumour-suppressor PTEN [J.J. Caffrey, T. Darden, M.R. Wenk, S.B. Shears, FEBS Lett. 499 (2001) 6 ], but the biological relevance has been questioned by others [E.A. Orchiston, D. Bennett, N.R. Leslie, R.G. Clarke, L. Winward, C.P. Downes, S.T. Safrany, J. Biol. Chem. 279 (2004) 1116 ]. The current study emphasizes the role of physiological levels of PTEN in Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 homeostasis. We employed two cell models. First, we used a human U87MG glioblastoma PTEN-null cell line that hosts an ecdysone-inducible PTEN expression system. Second, the human H1299 bronchial cell line, in which PTEN is hypomorphic due to promoter methylation, has been stably transfected with physiologically relevant levels of PTEN. In both models, a novel consequence of PTEN expression was to increase Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 pool size by 30-40% (p<0.01); this response was wortmannin-insensitive and, therefore, independent of the PtdIns 3-kinase pathway. In U87MG cells, induction of the G129R catalytically inactive PTEN mutant did not affect Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P(5) levels. PTEN induction did not alter the expression of enzymes participating in Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 synthesis. Another effect of PTEN expression in U87MG cells was to decrease InsP6 levels by 13% (p<0.02). The InsP6-phosphatase, MIPP, may be responsible for the latter effect; we show that recombinant human MIPP dephosphorylates InsP6 to D/L-Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5, levels of which increased 60% (p<0.05) following PTEN expression in U87MG cells. Overall, our data add higher inositol phosphates to the list of important cellular regulators [Y. Huang, R.P. Wernyj, D.D. Norton, P. Precht, M.C. Seminario, R.L. Wange, Oncogene, 24 (2005) 3819 ] the levels of which are modulated by expression of the highly pleiotropic PTEN protein.",
