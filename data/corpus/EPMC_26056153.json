    "abstract_text": "The human DNA polymerase gamma (Pol \u03b3) is responsible for DNA replication in mitochondria. Pol \u03b3 is particularly susceptible to inhibition by dideoxynucleoside-based inhibitors designed to fight viral infection. Here, we report crystal structures of the replicating Pol \u03b3-DNA complex bound to either substrate or zalcitabine, an inhibitor used for HIV reverse transcriptase. The structures reveal that zalcitabine binds to the Pol \u03b3 active site almost identically to the substrate dCTP, providing a structural basis for Pol \u03b3-mediated drug toxicity. When compared to the apo form, Pol \u03b3 undergoes intra- and inter-subunit conformational changes upon formation of the ternary complex with primer/template DNA and substrate. We also find that the accessory subunit Pol \u03b3B, which lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity and does not contact the primer/template DNA directly, serves as an allosteric regulator of holoenzyme activities. The structures presented here suggest a mechanism for processivity of the holoenzyme and provide a model for understanding the deleterious effects of Pol \u03b3 mutations in human disease. Crystal structures of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, Pol \u03b3, in complex with substrate or antiviral inhibitor zalcitabine provide a basis for understanding Pol \u03b3-mediated drug toxicity.",
