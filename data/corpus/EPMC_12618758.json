  "abstract_text": "The CD95 (APO-1/Fas) system plays a major role in induction of apoptosis in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. The CD95 (APO-1/Fas) ligand (CD95L) is induced in response to a variety of signals including TCR/CD3 stimulation or application of chemotherapeutic drugs. Here we report that an AP-1 site located in the 5' untranslated region of the CD95L gene is required for TCR/CD3-mediated induction of the human CD95L promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts of Jurkat T cells as well as TCR/CD3-restimulated primary human T cells demonstrated specific binding of AP-1, predominantly composed of c-Jun and FosB, to this sequence. Ectopic expression of transdominant negative Jun mutants strongly reduced CD95L promoter activity and activation-induced cell death (AICD), confirming the functional significance of FosB/c-Jun binding. Thus, our results demonstrate an important novel function for FosB dimerized with c-Jun in TCR/CD3-mediated AICD in human T cells.",
