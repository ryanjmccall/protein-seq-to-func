Transcription factors of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB/Rel family translocate into the nucleus upon degradation of the I\u03baBs. Postinduction repression of NF-\u03baB activity depends on NF-\u03baB\u2013regulated resynthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1, which dissociates NF-\u03baB from DNA and exports it to the cytosol. We found that after activation, p65/RelA is degraded by the proteasome in the nucleus and in a DNA binding\u2013dependent manner. If proteasome activity is blocked, NF-\u03baB is not promptly removed from some target genes in spite of I\u03baB\u03b1 resynthesis and sustained transcription occurs. These results indicate that proteasomal degradation of p65/RelA does not merely regulate its stability and abundance, but also actively promotes transcriptional termination. NF-\u03baB Rel family proteasome transcriptional regulation Introduction Transcriptional induction of a large number of inflammatory genes, immune response genes, and genes promoting cell survival of both normal and cancer cells is regulated by the five transcription factors (TFs) of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB/Rel family, namely p65/RelA, cRel, RelB, p50, and p52 ( 1 \u2013 3 ). Most homodimers and heterodimers generated by the NF-\u03baB/Rel proteins are found in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells in complexes with three major inhibitory proteins collectively indicated as I\u03baB, namely I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, and I\u03baB\u025b ( 4 ). p105 and p100 (the proteins from which p50 and p52 are generated through limited proteasomal processing) also contribute to cytoplasmic retention of NF-\u03baB/Rel dimers. I\u03baBs contain an NH 2 -terminal regulatory region that is phosphorylated in response to stimulation and COOH-terminal ankyrin repeats that mediate association with NF-\u03baB dimers. When extracellular signals transduced from several receptors activate the I\u03baB kinase complex, it phosphorylates the I\u03baBs at two amino-terminal serines, thus targeting them for polyubiquitination by the \u03b2TrCP proteins and subsequent proteasomal degradation ( 5 ). I\u03baB degradation allows NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus and bind target genes. In vitro, the complex between NF-\u03baB and the \u03baB site is extremely stable, with a dissociation constant below 10 \u221211 M ( 6 ) and a half-life of \u223c45 min. This stable complex can be rapidly dissociated by the addition of I\u03baB\u03b1, which reduces its half-life to 3 min ( 7 ). Several pieces of evidence indicate that I\u03baB\u03b1 is a master terminator of the NF-\u03baB response. First, it is rapidly resynthesized in an NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent manner ( 8 \u2013 10 ). Second, it can enter the nucleus as a free, NF-\u03baB\u2013unbound protein ( 11 ). Finally, it can export NF-\u03baB from the nucleus ( 11 \u2013 13 ). Therefore, according to the current model of NF-\u03baB response termination, after nuclear translocation, NF-\u03baB remains stably bound to target genes until resynthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 enters the nucleus, dissociates it from DNA, and shuttles it back to the cytoplasm, thus restoring the initial steady state. Analysis of I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 cells confirmed that resynthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1 provides a strong negative feedback and a fast down-regulation of the NF-\u03baB response ( 14 , 15 ), thus allowing the rapid termination of NF-\u03baB activity after a transient TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. I\u03baB\u03b2 can fully compensate for I\u03baB\u03b1 deficiency when knocked in the I\u03baB\u03b1 locus and placed under control of the I\u03baB\u03b1 promoter, which indicates that the irreplaceable role of I\u03baB\u03b1 in NF-\u03baB response termination simply reflects its unique temporal expression pattern ( 16 ). The main physiological role of I\u03baB\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u025b, as deduced from computer modeling applied to the analysis of gene-deficient cells, is to prevent oscillations of the NF-\u03baB response during long-lasting activations ( 15 ). Additional roles of I\u03baB\u025b in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of NF-\u03baB proteins cannot be ruled out, although I\u03baB\u025b is markedly less efficient than I\u03baB\u03b1 in this regard ( 17 ). In addition to the global down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activity due to I\u03baB\u03b1 resynthesis, gene-specific mechanisms of transcriptional shut-off exist that allow individual genes to be regulated in a selective fashion and independently of the behavior of the bulk of nuclear NF-\u03baB. These mechanisms include the recruitment to target genes of NF-\u03baB\u2013induced transcriptional repressors, such as Twist 1/2 ( 18 ), and the replacement of an active NF-\u03baB dimer with a dimer showing no transcriptional activity in the context of that specific gene ( 19 ). The experiments described here were designed with the aim of identifying additional mechanisms of NF-\u03baB response termination. We found that proteasome-dependent degradation of nuclear p65/RelA is a major mechanism of NF-\u03baB response termination in the absence of I\u03baB\u03b1. In cells containing I\u03baB\u03b1, proteasomal degradation of p65/RelA provides an essential contribution to a prompt shut-off of the response, thus indicating that proteasome and I\u03baB\u03b1 synergistically act to efficiently and promptly terminate transcription of NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent genes.

Results and Discussion Proteasome-dependent Down-Regulation of the NF-\u03baB Response in I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 Cells. To identify I\u03baB\u03b1-independent mechanisms of NF-\u03baB response termination, we analyzed how the NF-\u03baB response is terminated in the absence of I\u03baB\u03b1. WT or I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 3T3 cells were stimulated with a 15-min pulse of TNF-\u03b1, which induces the degradation of the I\u03baBs, and a single wave of nuclear translocation of p50/p65, the most abundant NF-\u03baB dimer in fibroblasts. Cells were then washed to remove TNF from the medium and terminate signaling. They were then placed in normal medium and returned to the incubator ( Fig. 1 a). In agreement with published results ( 14 , 15 ), in WT 3T3 cells NF-\u03baB activity was strongly down-regulated concurrently with completion of I\u03baB\u03b1 resynthesis, whereas in I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 3T3 cells the response was more sustained ( Fig. 1 a). However, in spite of I\u03baB\u03b1 absence, in these cells nuclear NF-\u03baB levels were also completely down-regulated in <4 h. Figure 1. Termination of the NF-\u03baB response in I\u03baB\u03b1-deficient cells. (A) Kinetics of NF-\u03baB down-regulation in WT and I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 3T3 cells. Cells were stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 as indicated and analyzed for NF-\u03baB binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a canonical \u03baB site as a probe (5\u2032-AGTTGAG GGGACTTTCC CAGGC-3\u2032). Data were quantified with a phosphorimager. Kinetics of I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and resynthesis are also shown. (B) Proteasome inhibition prevents NF-\u03baB down-regulation in I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. After TNF-\u03b1 washout, cells were incubated with \u03b2 lactone and assayed by EMSA. An anti-p65 Western blot (W.B.) on cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts is shown. (C) Endogenous p65 is ubiquitinated after NF-\u03baB activation. Extracts from I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p65 antibody and blotted with an anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody. H.C., heavy chains. (D) Reconstitution of p65 ubiquitination by cotransfection of FLAG-p65 and myc-ubiquitin expression vectors in HEK-293T cells. Blots obtained from whole cell extracts were probed with an anti-p65 polyclonal antibody and an anti-myc monoclonal antibody. (E) I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 cells were stimulated with TNF for 15 min, washed, and incubated with 10 ng/ml LMB for an additional 3.15 h. EMSAs were performed on nuclear lysates. As a positive control for LMB effects, accumulation of I\u03baB kinase complex \u03b1 in the nuclear fraction of LMB-treated cells is shown. When fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, the activation domains of p65 and of other TFs confer instability to the chimeric protein ( 20 ). Instability depends on proteasomal degradation of the fusion protein, which directly correlates with the potency of the activation domain fused to Gal4. Moreover, the domain(s) required for transcriptional activity often overlaps with those triggering degradation ( 21 ). Therefore, we tested if p65 is degraded by the proteasome and if degradation may account for the decay of NF-\u03baB activity in I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 3T3 cells were stimulated with TNF for 15 min, washed, and further incubated with vehicle or clasto-lactacystin \u03b2 lactone, a rapid and selective inhibitor of the chymotryptic and tryptic-like activities of the proteasome. In the presence of \u03b2 lactone, nearly all nuclear NF-\u03baB activity and p65 protein were preserved at >3 h after TNF washout ( Fig. 1 b). Conversely, the cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB fraction did not show any obvious change in abundance induced by proteasome inhibition. To determine if p65 is a direct target of the proteasome, we examined whether endogenous p65 is polyubiquitinated. To this aim, p65 was immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated as described above. A ladder of high molecular weight forms of p65 was selectively recognized by a monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin in \u03b2 lactone\u2013treated cells ( Fig. 1 c). To further demonstrate that p65 is polyubiquitinated, we cotransfected HEK-293T cells with expression vectors encoding p65 and myc-tagged ubiquitin. In these conditions, p65 exceeds the endogenous I\u03baBs and is constitutively nuclear. High molecular weight forms of p65 were strongly augmented by cotransfection of the ubiquitin expression vector ( Fig. 1 d), thus demonstrating that p65 undergoes polyubiquitination in vivo. Inhibition of Crm1-dependent nuclear export by leptomycin B (LMB) after a pulse of TNF only minimally interfered with complete down-regulation of NF-\u03baB nuclear levels ( Fig. 1 e), which indicates that although a minor fraction of NF-\u03baB is probably exported in an I\u03baB\u03b1-independent manner and degraded in the cytoplasm, most p65 molecules are in fact degraded in the nucleus. These results indicate that if NF-\u03baB does not rapidly reassociate with resynthesized I\u03baB\u03b1, it is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Assuming that \u223c120,000 p65 molecules enter nucleus after stimulation ( 22 ), that \u223c3.5 h are required for their complete degradation, and that the kinetics of degradation is linear, it can be roughly estimated that \u223c500\u2013600 molecules of p65 are degraded every minute. p65 Ubiquitination Requires Sequence-specific Binding to \u03baB Sites. To investigate if sequence-specific DNA binding is required for p65 polyubiquitination, we generated a p65 mutant in which two residues essential for base-specific contacts, Tyr 23 and Glu 26 (corresponding to Tyr 36 and Glu 39 in mouse p65; reference 23 ), were mutated to Ala and Asp, respectively. The mutant p65 was virtually unable to bind canonical \u03baB sites, both in homodimers and in heterodimers with p50 ( Fig. 2 a), whereas it was able to bind p50 and I\u03baB\u03b1 ( Fig. 2 b). The different amount of I\u03baB\u03b1 immunoprecipitated by the WT and the mutant p65 likely reflects its different abundance in cells overexpressing either of the two proteins. Indeed, although WT p65 increased expression of endogenous I\u03baB\u03b1, the mutant was devoid of this activity ( Fig. 2 a). The mutant p65 still retained a residual activity (\u223c15\u201320% of the WT protein) in luciferase assays (unpublished data). Polyubiquitination of the mutant p65 was much lower than that of the normal protein ( Fig. 2 c), which indicates that polyubiquitination of p65 mainly occurs upon binding to specific target sites in the chromatin. However, from these experiments it is not possible to determine if p65 degradation is restricted to those molecules actively engaged in transcriptional activation. Figure 2. p65 ubiquitination requires sequence-specific binding to \u03baB sites. (A) WT p65 and a p65 mutant bearing a double substitution in the Rel homology domain (23Y > A; 26E > D) were cloned with an NH 2 -terminal GFP tag and transfected in HEK-293 cells alone or with a p50 expression vector. Total lysates were made and assayed by EMSA using a canonical \u03baB site as a probe. The GFP tag allows easy discrimination between p65 homodimers and p65/p50 heterodimers (n.s., nonspecific). An anti-p65 immunoblot shows the expression of endogenous p65 and transfected GFP-p65 in total lysates. Expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 is also shown. (B) Association of WT and mutant GFP-p65 with p50 and I\u03baB\u03b1. 293T cells were transfected as indicated. Total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-p50 or an anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody and then blotted with an anti-p65 antibody. (C) The \u03baB site binding-deficient p65 mutant is not efficiently polyubiquitinated. HEK-293T were cotransfected with the indicated expression vectors. Whole cell extracts were assayed for the appearance of high molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of p65 by anti-p65 immunoblotting. (D) p65 induces recruitment of proteasome components to target genes. HEK-293 cells were transfected with empty vector or a FLAG-p65 expression vector. ChIP assays with an anti-FLAG antibody, an antibody against Sug1, or a control antibody were performed. Recruitment of FLAG-p65 and Sug1 to the endogenous I\u03baB\u03b1 gene promoter is shown. (E) Anti-p65 and anti-Sug1 ChIP assays on HEK-293 cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified with primers spanning the I\u03baB\u03b1 promoter or a region immediately downstream of the I\u03baB\u03b1 gene. Recruitment of Proteasome Components to NF-\u03baB Target Genes. If polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of p65 occur after recruitment to target genes, then the proteasome itself should be recruited to NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent promoters in a p65-dependent manner. To test this possibility, we transfected HEK-293 cells with a FLAG-p65 expression vector and performed a ChIP assay with an antibody recognizing the S8 component (Sug1) of the 19S proteasome complexes. p65 transfection induced a large increase in the association of Sug1 to the I\u03baB\u03b1 gene promoter, a typical NF-\u03baB target ( Fig. 2 d). Similarly, TNF-\u03b1 stimulation of HEK-293 cells induced Sug1 recruitment to the I\u03baB\u03b1 promoter, but not to a region located immediately 3\u2032 of the I\u03baB\u03b1 gene ( Fig. 2 e), suggesting that NF-\u03baB target genes may represent sites of proteasome-dependent degradation of p65. Removal of NF-\u03baB from Target Genes in I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 Cells Is Proteasome Dependent. To determine if proteasomal degradation of p65 is required to remove it from target genes, we performed ChIP assays with an anti-p65 antibody. In I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 3T3 cells, proteasome inhibition after a 15-min TNF-\u03b1 treatment caused the persistence of p65 on the promoters of several validated p65 target genes ( 24 ), such as the chemokines KC, inducible protein (IP)-10, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, as well as IL-6 ( Fig. 3 a). mRNA levels for these and several other NF-\u03baB target genes tested, with the exception of TNF-\u03b1, were stronger and more persistently up-regulated by TNF-\u03b1 in cells treated with \u03b2 lactone than in cells where proteasome activity is intact ( Fig. 3 b). Figure 3. Proteasome inhibition in I\u03baB\u03b1-deficient cells determines persistent promoter occupancy and increased NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent transcriptional activity. (A) Anti-p65 ChIP in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. \u03b2 lactone treatment after a pulse of TNF prolongs occupancy of all target genes tested and induces (B) increased and sustained transcription. (C) Proteasome inhibition increases \u03baB site\u2013directed transcription of a luciferase reporter in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. To directly determine if proteasome activity is required to shut off NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent transcription in the absence of I\u03baB\u03b1, we transfected I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 3T3 cells with a luciferase reporter controlled by three \u03baB sites. After transfection, cells were stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 for 15 min, washed, and incubated for an additional 6 h in medium with or without \u03b2 lactone. \u03baB site\u2013dependent transcription of the luciferase gene was up-regulated much stronger in cells treated with \u03b2 lactone than in control cells ( Fig. 3 c). These observations indicate that in cells lacking I\u03baB\u03b1, proteasomal degradation of p65 is required to remove it from target genes and terminate the response. Persistent promoter occupancy results in sustained NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent transcriptional activation. p65 Degradation and NF-\u03baB Response Shut Off in I\u03baB\u03b1-containing Cells. Next, we tested if proteasome activity also collaborates to NF-\u03baB response termination in cells expressing I\u03baB\u03b1. In WT 3T3 cells, proteasome inhibition after a 15-min pulse of TNF-\u03b1 prevented complete down-regulation of nuclear NF-\u03baB activity ( Fig. 4 a). This result indicates that termination of the NF-\u03baB response in normal cells reflects the combination of two separate activities: resynthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1 and degradation of NF-\u03baB. In WT 3T3 cells, \u03b2 lactone rescued \u223c25% of maximal NF-\u03baB activity (measured between 30 and 60 min after TNF-\u03b1). Figure 4. Effects of proteasome inhibition on NF-\u03baB response termination in I\u03baB\u03b1-containing cells. (A) Proteasome inhibition impairs down-regulation of nuclear NF-\u03baB activity (assayed by EMSA) in WT 3T3 cells. I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and resynthesis is also shown. (B) Anti-p65 ChIP assay and mRNA analysis (C) in TNF-stimulated WT 3T3 cells treated with \u03b2 lactone or vehicle as indicated. The effects of \u03b2 lactone treatment on IP-10 and MIP-2 occupancy by p65 and on their transcriptional activity are shown. (D) Effects of proteasome inhibition on NF-\u03baB response down-regulation and p65 occupancy of target genes (E) in NIH3T3 cells. To directly monitor if proteasome inhibition affects p65 occupancy of target gene promoters in normal cells, we performed ChIP assays in WT 3T3 cells stimulated with a pulse of TNF-\u03b1 and then treated with \u03b2 lactone. Proteasome inhibition after NF-\u03baB activation impaired or delayed the removal of p65 from the target genes MIP-2 and IP-10 ( Fig. 4 b). The most obvious differences between control and \u03b2 lactone\u2013treated cells in p65 removal from IP-10 were observed at the earlier time point ( Fig. 4 , T2), whereas at MIP-2 the effect was more sustained. Analysis of the corresponding mRNAs showed that although MCP-1 was similarly induced and down-regulated in control cells and cells treated with \u03b2 lactone, MIP-2 and IP-10 were induced in a more sustained fashion when proteasome activity was blocked ( Fig. 4 c). The lack of any detectable effect on the accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA (a p65 target itself) indicates that the effects of proteasome inhibition may in part be gene specific. Overall, proteasome inhibition exerted more dramatic effects in I\u03baB\u03b1-deficient cells than in normal cells ( Fig. 3 a), indicating a synergistic activity of proteasome and resynthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 in response termination. Indeed, in the absence of either I\u03baB\u03b1 or proteasome activity, NF-\u03baB response down-regulation was slower than normal. The observation that proteasome inhibition impairs or delays p65 removal from target genes even in the presence of a normal I\u03baB\u03b1 resynthesis is intriguing and may indirectly provide additional mechanistic insights into how NF-\u03baB is dissociated from chromatin. Several mechanisms may plausibly explain why resynthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 is unable to promptly remove NF-\u03baB from some target genes if proteasome is blocked. First, posttranslational modifications of p65, such as acetylation ( 25 ) or prolyl isomerization ( 26 ), have been shown to inhibit p65 interaction with I\u03baB\u03b1. If a promoter is loaded with p65 molecules bearing these modifications, it will likely depend on proteasomal degradation for p65 removal unless the posttranslational modification is erased. Second, when bound to some promoters in the context of large complexes of TFs, NF-\u03baB might be not accessible to I\u03baB\u03b1. In this case, proteasome may either disassemble and destroy the whole enhanceosome (including p65) or indirectly facilitate I\u03baB\u03b1 activity by removing peripherally located TFs, thus exposing DNA-bound p65. In different cell types, in response to different stimuli, and at the level of different promoters, the relative contribution of the two pathways to response termination may vary. Indeed, the behavior of NIH-3T3 and HeLa cells differed from that of WT 3T3 cells. In NIH-3T3 cells, \u03b2 lactone rescued \u223c50% of the maximal NF-\u03baB binding activity ( Fig. 4 d) and exerted a stronger and more sustained effect on p65 occupancy of MIP-2 and IP-10 promoters than that observed in WT 3T3 cells ( Fig. 4 e). In HeLa cells, \u03b2 lactone partially impaired NF-\u03baB down-regulation but only transiently, as response was anyway completely terminated at late time points (unpublished data). Conclusions. An adequate control of NF-\u03baB response termination is of paramount importance to prevent a sustained production of inflammatory mediators as well as an extended transcription of the many other genes controlled by the NF-\u03baB system. The absolute requirement for a stringent control of NF-\u03baB activity is clearly indicated by the multiple phenotypic abnormalities and the neonatal lethality observed in I\u03baB\u03b1-deficient mice ( 14 ). Here we show that p65 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is a dominant mechanism of posttranscriptional repression in the absence of I\u03baB\u03b1. More importantly, this mechanism acts in synergism with resynthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 to guarantee a timely termination of the response in normal cells. Because proteasome inhibition selectively affects the nuclear fraction of p65, it is clear that degradation of p65 is at least in great part linked to its activation. More specifically, p65 polyubiquitination requires binding to \u03baB sites as indicated by the inefficient ubiquitination of a p65 mutant that is devoid of high affinity \u03baB site binding activity. Remarkably, the proteasome-dependent pathway of NF-\u03baB response termination is conserved from Drosophila to mammals. Loss of function mutations in different components of the Drosophila SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligases cause increased levels of both full-length and processed Relish (a Drosophila NF-\u03baB homologue) and constitutive induction of the target gene diptericin ( 27 ). The interplay between ubiquitin, proteasome, and transcriptional regulation is extremely complex. A model compatible with many observations is that promoter-bound TFs recruit ubiquitin ligases, which ubiquitinate both TFs and RNApolI ( 28 ). Ubiquitination of TFs enhances their activity and promotes proteasome recruitment, which destroys the TFs and at the same time may exert nonproteolytic activities that stimulate transcription ( 29 ). As a consequence of this mechanism, TFs recruited to target promoters would trigger only a single round of transcriptional initiation and would be subsequently destroyed and eventually reloaded. In this context, the high number of p65-containing dimers (>100,000) that enter the nucleus after activation may serve as a reservoir of NF-\u03baB molecules available for the repetition of the cycle of recruitment, transcriptional activation, and degradation. The evaluation of the possible role of p65 ubiquitination in transcriptional activation will require the identification of the p65 ubiquitin ligase(s) acting at the promoter level. SOCS-1 has been recently reported to polyubiquitinate p65 and promote its degradation ( 26 ), but because SOCS-1 is mainly cytoplasmic it is unlikely to act in a transcription-coupled ubiquitination/degradation pathway. In addition to its role in response termination, degradation of chromatin-bound NF-\u03baB molecules may also promote an exchange of NF-\u03baB dimers at target genes ( 19 ), thus indirectly impacting on their transcriptional activity.

    "full_text_abstract": "Transcription factors of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB/Rel family translocate into the nucleus upon degradation of the I\u03baBs. Postinduction repression of NF-\u03baB activity depends on NF-\u03baB\u2013regulated resynthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1, which dissociates NF-\u03baB from DNA and exports it to the cytosol. We found that after activation, p65/RelA is degraded by the proteasome in the nucleus and in a DNA binding\u2013dependent manner. If proteasome activity is blocked, NF-\u03baB is not promptly removed from some target genes in spite of I\u03baB\u03b1 resynthesis and sustained transcription occurs. These results indicate that proteasomal degradation of p65/RelA does not merely regulate its stability and abundance, but also actively promotes transcriptional termination."
