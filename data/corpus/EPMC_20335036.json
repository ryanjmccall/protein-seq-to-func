  "title": "Two Australian families with inclusion-body myopathy, Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia: novel clinical and genetic findings.",

  "abstract_text": "We report the first Australian families with inclusion-body myopathy, Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). The clinical characteristics of the two pedigrees are described including a previously undescribed phenotypic feature of pyramidal tract dysfunction in one family member. A novel mutation in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene (p.Arg155Leu) was found in one family while the other family had a previously reported mutation (p.Leu198Trp). Our findings broaden the phenotypic spectrum of IBMPFD and further emphasise the resemblance to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in some cases.",
