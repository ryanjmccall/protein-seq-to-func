    "abstract_text": "The E2F family of transcription factors appears to play a critical role in the transcription of certain genes required for cell cycle progression. E2F1, the first cloned member of this family, is regulated during the cell cycle at the mRNA level by changes in transcription of the E2F1 gene and at the protein level by complex formation with proteins such as the retinoblastoma gene product (pRB), cyclin A and DP1. E2F1 can override a pRB-induced G1/S block and can behave as an oncogene in certain cells. E2F1 was cloned and was found to contain seven exons. The dinucleotides at the 5' and 3' splice sites of intron 4 do not agree with consensus splice site sequences. Fluorescence in situ hybridization localized E2F1 to chromosome 20q11. Knowledge of the organization of E2F1 may facilitate identification of additional E2F family members, as well as detection of E2F1 abnormalities in human tumors.",
