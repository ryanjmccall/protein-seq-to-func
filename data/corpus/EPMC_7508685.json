    "abstract_text": "The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) and its 39-kd receptor-associated protein (RAP) were identified by indirect immunofluorescence in human extravillous and villous trophoblast cells at different stages of pregnancy. The alpha 2MR/LRP was detected in invading trophoblast cells and in some instances these invading cells did not express RAP. In chorionic villi of first and second trimester placenta, alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP were found in cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. With advancing pregnancy alpha 2MR/LRP became primarily localized to the apical surface of the syncytiotrophoblast, while RAP was present in the cytoplasm. Villous cytotrophoblast cells lost both proteins by the third trimester. Isolated cytotrophoblast cells that undergo spontaneous differentiation into syncytiotrophoblast in culture increased expression of both alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP. With syncytium formation, alpha 2MR/LRP became localized to the plasma membrane in cup-like structures. Changes in the mRNAs for alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP paralleled the changes in relative abundance of the proteins assessed by immunofluorescence. cAMP treatment suppressed both alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP in the cultured trophoblasts, but alpha 2MR/LRP was reduced to a greater extent than RAP. We conclude that alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP are developmentally regulated in human trophoblast cells, that the temporal and spatial patterns of expression of these proteins can be dissociated, and that cAMP modulates both alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP in human trophoblast. The patterns of alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP expression in trophoblast cells are consistent with roles for the receptor in trophoblast invasion and transport of molecules across the syncytiotrophoblast.",
