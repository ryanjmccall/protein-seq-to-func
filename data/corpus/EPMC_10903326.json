  "abstract_text": "Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a unique renal disease characterized by thrombus-like substances in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries, dysbetalipoproteinemia, and elevated plasma concentrations of apoE. Recent studies identified several apoE mutations in patients with LPG, including apoE2(R145P) Sendai (apoE-Sendai). Virus-mediated transduction of apoE-Sendai in apoE-deficient hypercholesterolemic mice resulted in insufficient correction of hypercholesterolemia and a marked and temporal induction of plasma triglyceride levels. In vitro binding studies showed that apoE-Sendai has a reduced affinity for the low density lipoprotein receptor, suggesting that dysbetalipoproteinemia in LPG is caused by the apoE mutation. Furthermore, histological examination revealed marked intraglomerular depositions of apoE-containing lipoproteins in mice injected with apoE-Sendai virus. These LPG-like depositions were detected 6 days after virus injection and were sustained for at least 60 days. Our results demonstrated that apoE-Sendai is an etiological cause of LPG.",
