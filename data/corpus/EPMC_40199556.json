A histone deacetylase SIRT6 regulates the transcription of various genes involved in lipid metabolism. Fatty acid (FA) oxidation plays a pivotal role in maintaining hepatic lipid homeostasis, and its dysregulation significantly contributes to lipotoxicity and inflammation, driving the progression of steatotic liver disease. While SIRT6 is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), a central regulator of FA oxidation, the development of SIRT6 activators capable of enhancing FA oxidation and mitigating steatotic liver disease has yet to be achieved. This study evaluated the effect of MDL-800, a selective SIRT6 activator, on the expression of PPARα and genes related to FA oxidation. In AML12 mouse hepatocytes, MDL-800 treatment activated SIRT6 but unexpectedly decreased the expression of PPARα and its FA oxidation-associated target genes. Furthermore, OSS128167, a selective SIRT6 inhibitor, did not reverse the suppressive effects of MDL-800 on PPARα, suggesting that MDL-800 downregulates PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes through a mechanism independent of SIRT6 activation.

MDL-800 SIRT6 Reactive oxygen species Fatty acid oxidation PPARα Pusan National University 10.13039/501100002543 INTRODUCTION SIRT6 is a member of the sirtuin family that functions as a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase ( You and Liang, 2023 ). By regulating the transcription of numerous genes, SIRT6 orchestrates a variety of biological processes associated with longevity, including metabolism, oxidative stress response, DNA repair, autophagy, and inflammation ( Jiang et al ., 2013 ; You and Liang, 2023 ). Accordingly, SIRT6 has been identified as a protective factor against aging-related conditions, such as metabolic disease and cancer ( Tasselli et al ., 2017 ). The involvement of SIRT6 in hepatic lipid synthesis and metabolism is well-documented. The biosynthesis of fatty acids (FAs) and triglycerides from carbohydrates is regulated by several transcription factors, such as liver X receptor (LXR), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1) ( Schultz et al ., 2000 ; Cha and Repa, 2007 ; Xu et al ., 2013 ). SIRT6 deacetylates these transcription factors, suppressing their activity and thus inhibiting lipid synthesis ( Zhu et al ., 2021 ). Additionally, SIRT6 plays a role in FA β-oxidation, a process that converts FAs into acetyl CoA for energy production. FA oxidation is catalyzed by multiple enzymes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), whose transcription is activated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) ( Moreno et al ., 2010 ). SIRT6 directly interacts with and transactivates PPARα, thereby promoting the expression of FA oxidation-related genes ( Naiman et al ., 2019 ). In addition, SIRT6 represses microRNA-122, which targets genes involved in FA oxidation, such as ATP citrate lyase and CPT1 ( Elhanati et al ., 2016 ). These lines of evidence support the possibility that pharmacological activation of SIRT6 could inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and activate FA oxidation, thereby maintaining hepatic lipid homeostasis. MDL-800 is a small-molecule activator of SIRT6, which binds to an allosteric site on SIRT6 and enhances its deacetylase activity, with an EC 50 value of 10.3 μM ( Huang et al ., 2018 ). Since its discovery ( Huang et al ., 2018 ), MDL-800 has been shown to possess various biological activities. For instance, MDL-800 has demonstrated potential in inhibiting tumor growth. MDL-800 reduced the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through SIRT6-mediated cell-cycle arrest in vitro and ameliorated tumor growth in a xenograft model ( Huang et al ., 2018 ). MDL-800 also inhibited the proliferation of multiple non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in a SIRT6-dependent manner ( Shang et al ., 2021 ). Beyond cancer, MDL-800 has demonstrated benefits in non-malignant conditions. For example, MDL-800 was reported to inhibit liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride administration in mice ( Zhang et al ., 2021 ). Wu et al . demonstrated that MDL-800 attenuated heart failure in mice induced by high-fat diet feeding and streptozotocin treatment ( Wu et al ., 2022 ). Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a spectrum of disease that ranges from steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC ( Sanyal, 2019 ; Mehal, 2023 ). MASLD has emerged as the leading cause of chronic liver disease, affecting approximately 38% of the adult population ( Wong et al ., 2023 ). Metabolic dysfunction impairs FA oxidation, leading to elevated hepatic levels of lipotoxic free FAs ( Friedman et al ., 2018 ). This lipotoxicity induces hepatocyte death, exacerbating the progression of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis with increased inflammation and fibrosis ( Geng et al ., 2021 ; Chung et al ., 2022 ). Given the role of SIRT6 in regulating lipid synthesis and metabolism in the liver ( Dong, 2023 ), modulating SIRT6 activity is hypothesized to affect MASLD pathogenesis. Indeed, hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Sirt6 gene in mice enhanced steatosis by increasing FA synthesis and inhibiting FA oxidation ( Kim et al ., 2010 ). However, it has not been tested whether MDL-800, the first-in-class small-molecule SIRT6 activator ( Huang et al ., 2018 ), represses hepatic fat accumulation. In particular, the effect of MDL-800 on FA oxidation has not been reported although SIRT6 is known to activate PPARα and its downstream FA oxidation-related genes ( Naiman et al ., 2019 ). In this study, we investigated the effects of MDL-800 on the expression of PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes in hepatocytes. In contrast to the established role of SIRT6 in activating PPARα, we observed that MDL-800 inhibits PPARα and FA oxidation-associated genes in a SIRT6-independent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that MDL-800 suppresses PPARα and FA oxidation genes by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating stress kinases. SIRT6 is generally recognized for its protective role against cancer, and previous studies have shown that MDL-800 suppresses tumor growth via SIRT6-dependent mechanisms, such as cell cycle arrest ( Huang et al ., 2018 ). The current study expands the current understanding of the anti-proliferative properties of MDL-800 by demonstrating its ability to inhibit PPARα and FA oxidation through a SIRT6-independent mechanism. Given that FA oxidation provides energy essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation ( Carracedo et al ., 2013 ), the suppression of FA oxidation may contribute to reduced tumor growth. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative properties of MDL-800 reported in previous studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials MDL-800, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and dexamethasone were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). OSS128167 and SP600125 were obtained from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). The mixture of insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Fetal bovine serum was acquired from Hyclone (Logan, UT, USA). Penicillin-streptomycin was sourced from Welgene (Gyeongsan, Korea). Cell culture and transient transfection AML12 mouse hepatocytes were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Ham’s F12 medium (Welgene) containing 0.005 mg/mL insulin, 0.005 mg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenium, 40 ng/mL dexamethasone, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin–streptomycin. T-75 flasks were used for cell propagation, and the experiments were performed in 6-, 12-, and 96-well plates. The cells were grown until 80% confluency was reached and split at least twice a week. Overexpression of SIRT6 in AML12 cells was achieved by a transient transfection of the plasmid that expresses the mouse Sirt6 coding sequence or pcDNA3.1 as a negative control ( Moon et al ., 2019 ; Shi et al ., 2020 ). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolation of primary mouse hepatocytes Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6J mice using a two-step collagenase perfusion technique as previously described ( Hwang et al ., 2020b ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized, and the liver was perfused in situ via the portal vein with a calcium- and magnesium-free HEPES-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) (Welgene) to remove blood, followed by a collagenase-containing digestion buffer. The liver was excised and dissociated by gentle mechanical disruption, and the resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer. Hepatocytes were enriched by low-speed centrifugation at 50×g for 5 min and washed twice in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO 2 in DMEM (Hyclone), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Welgene). Cell lysis, subcellular fractionation, and immunoblot analysis To obtain whole-cell lysates, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Enzynomics, Seongnam, Korea) containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (GenDEPOT, Baker, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The subcellular fractionation of cells by differential centrifugation was performed, as previously described ( Hwang et al ., 2016 ). The lysate protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunoblot analyses were performed, as previously described ( Hwang et al ., 2020a ). Briefly, the protein extracts were loaded onto 6, 8, or 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein bands were visualized using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed using a ChemiDocTM MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The antibody against PPARα was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA). Antibodies against LIPIN-1, acetyl-Histone H3 (Lys9), acetyl-Histone H3 (Lys56), SIRT6, JNK, phospho-JNK, ERK, phospho-ERK, p38, and phospho-p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). The antibody against β-Actin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). The antibody against Lamin A/C was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Total RNA isolation and RT-qPCR Total RNA was purified from the cell cultures using RiboEx TM reagents (Geneall, Seoul, Korea) as described previously ( Kwon et al ., 2024 ). Briefly, one microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using a SuPrimeScript cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (GenetBio, Daejeon, Korea). cDNAs were amplified using a SYBR Green Kit (Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea) on a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad). The 2 −∆∆Ct method was used to calculate mRNA levels. The primer sequences used for PCR are listed in Table1 . Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay Cell viability was measured using a CCK-8 assay kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Cho et al ., 2023 ). Briefly, AML12 mouse hepatocytes were treated with MDL-800 for 12 h. After the treatment period, the cells were further incubated with CCK-8 reagent for 90 min, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. DCF-DA assay The production of intracellular ROS was measured using the 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) assay (Abcam, ab113851) ( Hwang et al ., 2020a ). For fluorescence microscopy, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured until 70-80% confluency. The cells were washed twice with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 10 µM DCF-DA in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. Following incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove excess probes and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (excitation/emission: 485/535 nm). For fluorescence measurement using a plate reader, cells were seeded in black 96-well plates and grown to 80% confluency. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 10 µM DCF-DA in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. Excess dye was removed by washing three times with PBS, and fluorescence was measured immediately using a microplate reader (excitation/emission: 485/535 nm). Both data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (v.7.0a; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Student’s t -test were performed to compare the values obtained from the two groups. To compare more than three groups, a one-way analysis of variance was conducted, followed by post-hoc Tukey’s tests to determine specific group differences. A p -value of <0.05 was deemed statistically significant. RESULTS MDL-800 inhibits the expression of PPARα and the downstream FA oxidation-related genes in hepatocytes Previous studies have reported that MDL-800 ( Fig. 1A ) activates SIRT6 at concentrations above 25 μM in HCC cell lines ( Huang et al ., 2018 ), whereas lower concentrations of MDL-800 (5 and 10 μM) did not induce SIRT6 activation in AML12 mouse hepatocytes ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Based on these findings, we examined the effects of MDL-800 at 25, 50, and 100 μM on the expression of FA oxidation-related genes. Treatment with MDL-800 at 50 and 100 μM significantly reduced PPARα expression in AML12 cells ( Fig. 1B ). Additionally, MDL-800 suppressed the expression of LIPIN-1, a coactivator that enhances PPARα by enhancing its interaction with PGC-1α ( Finck et al ., 2006 ). Acetylated histone H3K56 levels were reduced in MDL-800-treated cells, indicating that MDL-800 treatment activated SIRT6. As PPARα is a crucial transcription factor that controls the transcription of multiple FA oxidation-related genes, we further tested the effect of MDL-800 on the nuclear expression of PPARα. Nuclear levels of PPARα were reduced by a treatment with MDL-800 ( Fig. 1C ). Moreover, the mRNA levels of Ppara and FA oxidation-related genes, such as Cpt1a , Acox1 , and Lpin1 , were reduced by a treatment with MDL-800 in AML12 cells ( Fig. 1D ). These results indicate that MDL-800 suppresses PPARα and its downstream target genes involved in FA oxidation. MDL-800 inhibits FA oxidation-related genes in a SIRT6-independent manner We investigated whether the inhibitory effects of MDL-800 on PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes are mediated by SIRT6 activation. Immunoblot analyses revealed that MDL-800 retained its ability to suppress PPARα and LIPIN-1 in the presence of OSS128167, a selective SIRT6 inhibitor ( Fig. 2A ). Consistently, OSS128167 treatment failed to reverse the reduction in Ppara , Cpt1a , and Acox1 mRNA levels caused by MDL-800 in AML12 cells ( Fig. 2B ). These results indicate that MDL-800 inhibits PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes independently of SIRT6 activation. However, as expected, SIRT6 overexpression increased the mRNA levels of Ppara , Cpt1a , and Ppargc1a (encoding PGC-1α) in AML12 cells ( Fig. 2C ), in contrast to their downregulation by MDL-800 ( Fig. 1D ). Taken together, these results confirm that MDL-800 inhibits FA oxidation-related genes through a mechanism that is not dependent on SIRT6 activation. MDL-800 induces cellular stress in hepatocytes It has been reported that PPARα is inhibited by cellular stress involving the activation of stress kinases, such as JNK ( Vernia et al ., 2014 ). To elucidate the mechanism by which MDL-800 inhibits PPARα, we examined whether MDL-800 induces cellular stress at the identical concentrations that inhibit PPARα. MDL-800 treatment marginally caused cytotoxicity at 25 μM, and cytotoxicity was markedly enhanced at 50 and 100 μM ( Fig. 3A ). Treatment with 50 and 100 μM of MDL-800 remarkably increased the phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK in AML12 cells ( Fig. 3B ). These results indicate that MDL-800 induces cytotoxicity and activates stress kinases, which may contribute to its inhibitory effects on PPARα. MDL-800 activates stress kinases and enhances ROS levels in hepatocytes To determine whether MDL-800-induced cellular stress is associated with ROS production, we measured ROS levels in AML12 cells. DCF-DA assays were performed using two methods to detect DCF fluorescence that represents intracellular ROS levels. Microscopic analyses revealed a dose-dependent increase in ROS levels following MDL-800 treatment ( Fig. 4A , Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Consistently, quantitative analyses using a fluorescence microplate reader confirmed that MDL-800 treatment promoted ROS production in AML12 cells ( Fig. 4B ). Excessive ROS levels trigger cellular responses, including the activation of NRF2 and the upregulation of its downstream antioxidant genes ( Attucks et al ., 2014 ). In agreement with this, MDL-800 treatment increased the expression of antioxidant genes, such as Hmox1 and Nqo1 ( Fig. 4C ). Taken together, these results demonstrate that MDL-800 elevates ROS levels in hepatocytes, thereby contributing to cellular stress and PPARα inhibition. MDL-800 inhibits PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes through ROS production Given that MDL-800 increases ROS levels in hepatocytes and cellular stress inhibits PPARα, we investigated whether ROS plays a crucial role in mediating the suppression of PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes by MDL-800. Treatment with H 2 O 2 significantly reduced the mRNA levels of Ppara , Cpt1a , and Acox1 in AML12 cells, indicating the ability of ROS to suppress PPARα and its downstream FA oxidation-related genes ( Fig. 5A ). To further validate the role of ROS in MDL-800-induced inhibition of PPARα, we assessed whether this effect could be reversed by the antioxidant NAC. Pretreatment with NAC prevented the MDL-800-induced reduction in the mRNA levels of Ppara , Cpt1a , Acox1 , and Acadvl ( Fig. 5B ), indicating that ROS production mediates the inhibitory effects of MDL-800 on PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes. Moreover, treatment with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, mitigated the suppression of FA oxidation-related genes by MDL-800 ( Fig. 5C ). Taken together, these findings suggest that MDL-800 inhibits FA oxidation-related genes through ROS production and the subsequent activation of JNK signaling pathways ( Fig. 6 ). DISCUSSION SIRT6 regulates a variety of biological processes related to energy metabolism, including FA oxidation. SIRT6 activation promotes FA oxidation, which has been suggested as a pharmacological strategy to ameliorate hepatic lipid accumulation and consequent lipotoxicity that exacerbates steatotic liver disease. However, in contrast to the ability of SIRT6 to activate PPARα ( Naiman et al ., 2019 ), the current study has demonstrated that MDL-800, a selective activator of SIRT6, inhibits PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes in hepatocytes. The findings from the current study support the notion that MDL-800 represses PPARα in a SIRT6-independent manner. For instance, MDL-800 reduced the expression of PPARα even at concentrations where SIRT6 was activated. Moreover, the suppression of PPARα by MDL-800 persisted despite concomitant treatment with OSS128167, a SIRT6 inhibitor, further indicating that this regulatory effects is independent of SIRT6. In addition, this study has investigated the mechanistic aspects that may explain how MDL-800 inhibits PPARα and FA oxidation, providing evidence suggesting that ROS production and stress kinase activation contribute to SIRT6-independent inhibition of PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes by MDL-800. MDL-800 treatment increased cellular ROS levels and activated stress kinases in hepatocytes in addition to SIRT6 activation, and MDL-800-induced PPARα inhibition was reversed by a concomitant treatment with an antioxidant NAC or a selective JNK inhibitor SP600125. As SIRT6 overexpression in AML12 cells elevated the expression of PPARα and its target genes, SIRT6 activation by MDL-800 could potentially lead to PPARα activation; however, it is likely that MDL-800-induced ROS production overrides SIRT6-mediated PPARα activation, eventually inhibiting PPARα and its target genes. Although the current study demonstrates that MDL-800 and H 2 O 2 reduce Ppara mRNA levels, leading to suppressed expression of PPARα, the precise mechanism by which MDL-800 and oxidative stress decrease Ppara mRNA levels remains unclear. While the reduction in Ppara mRNA levels could suggest transcriptional inhibition by MDL-800, other potential mechanisms, such as accelerated mRNA degradation or microRNA-mediated inhibition of Ppara , should also be considered. Further research is necessary to more thoroughly elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying the regulation of Ppara mRNA by MDL-800. In contrast to our findings that MDL-800 increased cellular ROS levels, Shen et al . reported that MDL-800 treatment attenuated ROS levels in hydrogen peroxide-treated granulosa cells ( Shen et al ., 2023 ). Several key discrepancies exist between their study and ours. First, while Shen et al . (2023) used granulosa cells, our study utilized hepatocyte lines. In addition, they tested lower concentrations of MDL-800 (2.5-10 μM), whereas we employed higher concentrations (25-50 μM). Moreover, we investigated the effect of MDL-800 alone, while Shen et al . (2023) tested the effect of MDL-800 in cells challenged with hydrogen peroxide. It would be interesting to explore whether MDL-800 mitigates hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity in hepatocytes, contrasting with our finding that MDL-800 exacerbates oxidative stress in untreated hepatocytes. ROS has been shown to inhibit FA oxidation in cancer cells ( Schafer et al ., 2009 ), which allowed us to hypothesize that MDL-800-induced ROS production may inhibit FA oxidation; however, the precise mechanism by which ROS suppresses FA oxidation and the potential involvement of PPARα in this process remain unclear. Our study revealed that hydrogen peroxide treatment reduced the mRNA levels of Ppara , Cpt1a , and Acox1 . The mechanism by which ROS inactivates PPARα in hepatocytes requires further investigation and remains a significant area of interest for future research. Cancer cells require increased energy production for survival under certain conditions, such as when they lose attachment to the extracellular matrix ( Carracedo et al ., 2013 ). FAs are known to produce twice as much ATP as carbohydrates ( Carracedo et al ., 2013 ), and FA oxidation is an essential process that converts FAs into acetyl CoA, which is utilized for ATP production by Krebs cycle. The growth of cancer cells is also dependent on cytosolic NADPH levels, and FA oxidation also contributes to NADPH production as Krebs cycle produces citrate, which is involved in cytosolic production of NADPH ( Pike et al ., 2011 ). Schafer et al . demonstrated that FA oxidation supports the survival of cancer cells under metabolic stress ( Schafer et al ., 2009 ). Moreover, FA oxidation has been suggested as a mechanism by which cancer cells obtain resistance to immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( Liu et al ., 2023 ). Conversely, inhibition of FA oxidation has been suggested as a strategy to ameliorate various types of cancers. Samudio et al . reported that inhibition of FA oxidation made leukemia cells more susceptible to apoptosis induced by cancer chemotherapy ( Samudio et al ., 2010 ). Liu et al . demonstrated that abrogating FA oxidation sensitized prostate cancer cells to cellular immune cytotoxicity ( Liu et al ., 2023 ). In addition, lipotoxicity can be induced by the accumulation of FAs that are not processed through β-oxidation. The anti-tumor effects of MDL-800 have been documented in several cancer types, such as HCC ( Huang et al ., 2018 ) and non-small cell lung cancer ( Shang et al ., 2021 ). However, its potential link to FA metabolism has not been explored. Our study proposes that the anti-proliferative effects of MDL-800 reported in the literature may be, at least in part, attributable to its inhibition of FA oxidation. While the SIRT6-dependent mechanisms, such as cell-cycle arrest, have been identified as contributors to the anti-proliferative activity of MDL-800, uncovering a SIRT6-independent inhibition of FA oxidation could further enhance the potential of MDL-800 as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Beyond its implications for HCC treatment, SIRT6 activation could account for various benefits against the MASLD pathogenesis. For example, SIRT6 has been shown to suppress the expression of fibrogenic genes ( Maity et al ., 2020 ; Zhong et al ., 2020 ), and Zhang et al . reported that MDL-800 mitigates liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride in mice ( Zhang et al ., 2021 ). Further investigation is warranted to determine whether MDL-800 can alleviate MASLD-related fibrosis. However, careful consideration is necessary when developing MDL-800 for non-malignant diseases, as its established anti-proliferative effects may lead to hepatocyte cytotoxicity and exacerbate MASLD. Therefore, optimizing the dosage will be a critical challenge in tailoring MDL-800 for specific disease contexts.

  "plain_text": "A histone deacetylase SIRT6 regulates the transcription of various genes involved in lipid metabolism. Fatty acid (FA) oxidation plays a pivotal role in maintaining hepatic lipid homeostasis, and its dysregulation significantly contributes to lipotoxicity and inflammation, driving the progression of steatotic liver disease. While SIRT6 is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), a central regulator of FA oxidation, the development of SIRT6 activators capable of enhancing FA oxidation and mitigating steatotic liver disease has yet to be achieved. This study evaluated the effect of MDL-800, a selective SIRT6 activator, on the expression of PPARα and genes related to FA oxidation. In AML12 mouse hepatocytes, MDL-800 treatment activated SIRT6 but unexpectedly decreased the expression of PPARα and its FA oxidation-associated target genes. Furthermore, OSS128167, a selective SIRT6 inhibitor, did not reverse the suppressive effects of MDL-800 on PPARα, suggesting that MDL-800 downregulates PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes through a mechanism independent of SIRT6 activation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MDL-800 increased the production of reactive oxygen species and activated stress kinases. The inhibition of PPARα by MDL-800 was reversed by co-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or the JNK inhibitor SP600125. In summary, MDL-800 suppresses PPARα and FA oxidation-related genes primarily through the induction of oxidative stress in hepatocytes, independent of its role as a SIRT6 activator."
