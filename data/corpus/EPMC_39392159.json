The only known difference between these 2 isoform families is a 6‐amino acid switch from CDKPRR (in VEGF 165 a) to SLTRKD (in VEGF 165 b). We have recently shown that VEGF 165 b can induce VEGFR2‐activation but fails to induce VEGFR1 (VEGF receptor 1)‐activation. The molecular mechanisms that regulate VEGF 165 b's ability toward differential VEGFR2 versus VEGFR1 activation/inhibition are not yet clear. Methods and Results Hypoxia serum starvation was used as an in vitro peripheral artery disease model.

A synthetic anti‐angiogenic VEGF 165 b splice variant in which the KD residues were switched to RR (VEGF 165 b KD→RR ) activated both VEGFR1‐ and VEGFR2‐signaling pathways to induce ischemic‐endothelial cell angiogenic capacity in vitro and enhance perfusion recovery in a severe experimental‐peripheral artery disease model significantly higher than VEGF 165 a.

Switching the lysine‐aspartic acid residues to arginine residues in VEGF 165 b (vascular endothelial growth factor 165 b) isoform results in the formation of a novel synthetic VEGF isoform (VEGF 165 b lysine‐aspartic acid→arginine‐arginine ) that has significantly higher ischemic angiogenic capacity than VEGF 165 a. The ability of this novel recombinant VEGF isoform to induce ischemic‐endothelial cell angiogenic capacity and perfusion recovery higher than VEGF 165 a is partly mediated via P38 activation in experimental‐peripheral artery disease models. What Question Should Be Answered Next? Role of proinflammatory NF‐kB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling downstream of VEGF 165 b lysine‐aspartic acid→arginine‐arginine in regulating ischemic angiogenesis and perfusion recovery in experimental‐peripheral artery disease needs further investigation. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a significant global health concern. 1 It is becoming increasingly common in recent years as a result of the increase in obesity and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for PAD. 2 Increased life expectancy also results in increased cases of PAD as elderly people are more likely to acquire atherosclerosis eventually leading to PAD. 3 Severe PAD (chronic limb‐threatening ischemia) frequently results in limb necrosis and amputations. 4 Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels, restores blood flow to PAD muscle. Therapeutic angiogenesis is a potential treatment for PAD that could improve symptoms and perfusion in ischemic tissue. 5 VEGF‐A (vascular endothelial growth factor‐A) binding to VEGFR2 (VEGF receptor 2) results in the activation of a potent pro‐angiogenic downstream signaling that includes AKT serine/threonine kinase 1‐extracellular signal‐regulated kinase‐endothelial nitric oxide synthase (AKT‐ERK‐eNOS) pathways. Despite the ability of VEGF‐A to induce potent angiogenesis, VEGF‐A clinical trials to achieve perfusion relief in patients with PAD were not successful. 6 VEGF‐A is structurally related to VEGF‐B, PlGF (Placental Growth Factor), VEGF‐C, and VEGF‐D glycoproteins that bind to extracellular IgG‐like domains on receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. 7 VEGFR1 is considered a decoy receptor that controls VEGFR2‐induced angiogenesis by functioning as a VEGF‐A trap in developmental studies, VEGF‐A binding to VEGFR2 induces potent angiogenesis, 8 , 9 and VEGFR3 is lymphangiogenic. 10 Based on the function and binding patterns, VEGF family ligands can be subdivided into (1) VEGF‐B and PlGF that solely bind to VEGFR1, (2) VEGF‐A binds to both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 to induce potent angiogenesis, and (3) VEGF‐C and VEGF‐D bind to both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 to exert angiogenic and lymphangiogenic activities. 11 In humans, these ligands are further diversified by alternate splicing resulting in varying affinities for heparin binding. 11 Alternate splicing of PlGF results in PlGF 1–4 isoforms, 12 VEGF‐B results in VEGF‐B 187 and VEGF‐B 186, 13 and VEGF‐A results in 6 isoforms (VEGF 206 , VEGF 189 , VEGF 165 , VEGF 145 , VEGF 121 , and VEGF 111 ). 14 Additionally, proximal and distal site selection in exon‐8 of VEGF‐A 15 , 16 results in the formation of pro‐angiogenic VEGF‐A (VEGF xxx a, xxx for the number of amino acids, V 165 a, Uniport identifier: P15692‐4) and anti‐angiogenic VEGF‐A (V 165 b, considered most abundant and potent, 17 , 18 Uniport identifier [P15692‐8]) isoform families increasing the diversity and complexity of VEGF networks. The only difference between the 2 isoforms is a 6‐amino acid switch from “CDKPRR” in the C‐terminus of V 165 a to “SLTRKD” (in mouse PLTGKD) in V 165 b. 15 , 16 VEGF 165 b has been poorly characterized and available information describes it as a competitive blocker of VEGF 165 a induced VEGFR2 activation. 14 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 It is still not clear how the 6‐amino acid variation in exon‐8 of VEGF 165 b alters its properties. It was hypothesized that the positively charged arginine residues in the C‐terminus of VEGF 165 a (CDKPRR) provide an overall positive charge to VEGF 165 a isoforms that is needed to induce a conformational change for VEGFR2 autophosphorylation and activation of downstream pro‐angiogenic signaling. However, the replacement of these arginine residues with lysine (negatively charged amino acid) and aspartic acid (positively charged amino acid) in VEGF 165 b (SLTRKD) isoforms provides a net neutral charge that was predicted to be responsible for VEGF 165 b's inability to induce a conformation change that is necessary to autophosphorylate VEGFR2 and activate downstream signaling. 14 In PAD, we have previously shown that the fraction of VEGF 165 b in total VEGF‐A is ~3X higher than the pro‐angiogenic VEGF 165 a fraction. 23 Using an isoform‐specific VEGF 165 b antibody, we have shown that VEGF 165 b inhibition induces angiogenesis in ischemic vasculature to enhance perfusion recovery. However, the perfusion recovery achieved by VEGF 165 b inhibition is associated with the activation of the VEGFR1‐STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway, 23 but not with VEGFR2‐AKT‐eNOS‐NO signaling pathways in ischemic endothelial cells (ECs). 24 Furthermore, we have recently shown that VEGF 165 b activated VEGFR2‐AKT‐Erk‐eNOS signaling almost to the same extent as VEGF 165 a indicating that VEGF 165 b functions as an agonist for VEGFR2 activation, 24 whereas it functions as a blocker of VEGFR1 activation. 23 Based on these data, we hypothesized that the net neutral charge due to the presence of lysine‐aspartic acid (KD) residues in C‐terminus 14 , 15 , 16 of VEGF 165 b could be a determining factor in blocking VEGFR1 activation and downstream signaling. To test this hypothesis, we developed a modified VEGF 165 b isoform wherein the KD residues are switched to RR (arginine‐arginine [SLTR‐RR], [VEGF 165 b KD→RR ]) to determine whether these 2 amino acids are sufficient to confer VEGFR1 inhibitory and anti‐angiogenic effects displayed by VEGF 165 b isoforms in experimental‐PAD models. Furthermore, we performed phospho‐profiling arrays consisting of 5 principal signaling pathways including MAPK (mitogen‐activated protein kinase)‐signaling, AKT‐signaling, JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT‐signaling, NF‐kB (nuclear factor kappa B)‐signaling, and TGF‐β (transforming growth factor beta) signaling pathways in hypoxia serum starved (HSS) ECs and compared the downstream signaling activated by the modified VEGF 165 b isoform and VEGF 165 a. We also tested whether this KD to RR amino acid switch can endow this modified VEGF 165 b isoform with pro‐angiogenic properties similar to VEGF 165 a in experimental‐PAD models. METHODS The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Ethical Approval and Informed Consent No human subjects/participants were involved in this study. Mice All animal experimental protocols were approved by Augusta University's Institutional Animal Care Committees and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Healthy male 12‐ to 16‐week‐old Balb/cJ mice (maximum of 5 mice/per cage) were used in all the experiments. Mice were housed in pathogen‐free husbandry with free access to water and chow (Tekland, Cat No: 8064) with a 12‐hour light/dark cycle. Murine Model of Hind Limb Ischemia and Quantifying Microvascular Blood Flow A previous study by Peng et al 25 showed a significant decrease in perfusion recovery in female C57BL/6J mice compared with male mice. However, we did not observe significant differences in the perfusion recovery between male and female mice. Hence, only male mice were used in the current study. Femoral artery ligation and resection results in the development of severe PAD in Balb/cJ mice with extensive tissue loss, significantly higher necrosis incidence, and severity 26 , 27 by days 1 to 3 post‐hind limb ischemia (HLI) making it difficult to measure blood flow until day 21. Hence, we employed a less severe PAD model in Balb/cJ mice by a single distal occlusion of the femoral artery without resection as described previously. 24 , 27 , 28 , 29 This less severe PAD model decreases necrosis incidence and severity allowing laser speckle blood flow measurements (primary readout) feasible until day 21 post‐HLI. A combination of ketamine (Ketathesia, (ZooPharm, 90 mg/kg)) and xylazine (Anased, Akorn, 10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (single dose) at 10 μL/gm mouse to induce anesthesia and perform unilateral femoral artery ligation as a model of experimental‐PAD. Meloxicam (5 mg/kg) was injected once daily at 24‐hour intervals for 2 days to relieve pain and discomfort in the mice that underwent HLI surgery. Mice were euthanized with an overdose (20 μL/gm mouse) of ketamine and xylazine combination followed by cervical dislocation. Briefly, the femoral artery was ligated using a 8‐0 nylon monofilament just above the inguinal ligament. Perfusion recovery was measured by quantifying microvascular blood flow by laser speckle imaging (Perimed, Inc, Ardmore, PA) on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 post‐HLI. Perfusion in the ischemic limb was normalized to a nonischemic limb for each mouse. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 Mice in each cage were randomly allocated to control or treated groups with comparable numbers. A minimum of n=5 was used for each group in the experiments according to our previous publications. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 Mice numbers for each experimental group were indicated in the corresponding figure legend. Out of a total of 65 mice that underwent HLI, 1 mouse died during surgery and another mouse was excluded from the study due to abnormal blood flow values. Only the surgeon performing HLI was aware of the treatment groups. Perfusion in the ischemic limb was normalized to that in the nonischemic limb for each mouse. Exclusion criteria set a priori included mice with abnormal blood flow values (showing >50% recovery by day 3 post‐HLI) or necrosis severity reaching Grade IV (euthanized at the first sign of noticing according to the animal care and use guidelines). Two mice (1 died and another with abnormal blood flow values) were excluded from the study. A checklist based on Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments reporting guidelines was used to report the use of laboratory animals in the study. 30 Intramuscular Plasmid Delivery By Electroporation For nontargeting control, VEGF 165 a expressing, VEGF 165 b expressing, or VEGF 165 b KD→RR expressing plasmid transfer into mouse hind limbs, electric‐pulse‐mediated gene transfer was performed as described previously. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia 150 μg of plasmid DNA (150 μg/100 μL of saline) was injected into mouse hind limbs using a 0.5‐mL syringe with a 28‐gauge needle in 3 sites (1 site in Tibialis Anterior [TA] and 2 non‐overlapping‐sites in Gastrocnemius [GA] muscles). Seven electric pulses (100 milliseconds, 1 Hz, and 100 V) were delivered immediately to the injected muscle using a 2‐needle Array (BTX Instrument Division, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), placed on the medial and lateral sides of the muscle so that the electrical field is perpendicular to the long axis of the myofibers. Mice were allowed to recover for 7 days before use in HLI experiments. 28 , 29 Evans Blue Extravasation At day 2 post HLI, mice were injected with Evans Blue dye (100 μL of 20 mg/mL solution in saline) intraperitoneally and gastrocnemius muscles were harvested 24 hours later. Briefly, gastrocnemius muscles were weighed and freeze dried overnight. Formamide was added to the tissues at a 1:5 (weight:volume) ratio and incubated at 60 °C for 2 hours to extract Evans Blue dye followed by an additional 10 hours at room temperature. 31 , 32 , 33 The intensity of Evans Blue dye in the formamide was measured using a BioTek Synergy LX Multimode plate reader at 595 nm. Immunostaining Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C followed by room temperature (RT) for another 24 hours. Later tissues were incubated in 30% sucrose for ~24 hours (until the tissues sank to the bottom) and embedded in optimal cutting temperature for cryosectioning. Next, 5 micron thick cryosections were processed for immunostaining. Briefly, sections were washed in PBS twice followed by antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (Cat no: H3300, Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA) blocked in 5% goat serum for 1 hour followed by incubation in CD31 (Cat No: MA3105, ThermoFisher) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (Cat No: NA03, Millipore‐Sigma) or pP38 antibody (Cat No: 4511S, Cell Signaling and Technology) overnight at 4 °C. Later sections were washed (PBS) and incubated in secondary antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor‐488 (Cat No: A78963) and AlexaFluor‐555 (Cat No: A31572) purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific for 2 hours at RT. Sections were washed (PBS) and mounted using prolong gold antifade mounting media (Cat No: P36935, ThermoFisher). Immunofluorescence was visualized and images were obtained using EVOS M5000 fluorescent microscope or Zeiss Confocal microscope. The omission of primary or secondary antibodies served as negative control. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 Capillary Density Vascular density and endothelial proliferation were quantified as %CD31+ PCNA+ cells per muscle fiber area on day‐21 post‐HLI tissue sections. At least 3 random images per section from each muscle tissue immunostained with CD31/PCNA or CD31/pP38 were photographed. In each image, CD31+ cells/mm 2 , CD31+ PCNA+ cells/mm 2 or pP38+/CD31+ cells/mm 2 were counted. Differences in fold change between control versus experimental groups were obtained by normalizing the mean of the cell counts in experimental groups (VEGF 165 a or VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated groups) with the control group. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 Fold change differences (100% is denoted as 1) between different groups were plotted on Graph Pad Prism9 and examined for statistical significance. Cell Culture Primary human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were purchased from ATCC (Cat No: PCS‐100‐013) and cultured in an all‐in‐one complete endothelial growth medium (Cat No: 211–500; Cell Applications Inc. San Diego, CA). 23 , 24 HUVECs were used before passage‐6 according to our previous publications. 23 , 24 , 28 , 34 VEGF 165 a Expressing Plasmid, VEGF 165 b KD → RR Expressing Plasmid, and Recombinant VEGF 165 b KD → RR Production VEGF 165 a expressing plasmid was synthesized according to our previous publications. 29 , 35 VEGF 165 b KD→RR expressing plasmid and recombinant VEGF 165 b KD→RR protein were synthesized by Bon‐Opus Biosciences. The complete DNA sequence of VEGF 165 b KD→RR and the plasmid map is provided in Figure S1 . The DNA sequence of a signal peptide followed by hIgG1 Fc tag, enterokinase protease cleavage sites, and VEGF 165 b KD→RR target protein was synthesized and cloned into the expression vector PTT5 using EcoRI and HindIII sites at 5′ and 3′ ends respectively. The expression plasmid encoding Fc‐VEGF‐PTT5 was expressed in 50 mL Expi293 cells and the culture mediums were collected on the fifth day of transfection. The culture medium of Fc‐VEGF 165 b KD→RR fusion protein was purified by MabSelect SuRe LX and recovered with 0.1 mol/L glycine, pH 3.0, neutralized with 1 mol/L Tris, pH 8.0 buffer. Eluted fractions were pooled and the buffer was exchanged. The hIgG1 Fc tag was separated and removed by enterokinase protease digestion from VEGF 165 b KD→RR protein and the final target protein VEGF 165 b KD→RR was purified by MabSelect SuRe LX. Cell Transfection Nontargeting siRNA (Cat No: D‐001206‐13‐20) was purchased from Horizon Discovery. VEGFR1 siRNA (Assay ID: 144806) and VEGFR2 siRNA (Assay ID: 145034) were purchased from ThermoFisher. RNAiMax (Cat No: 13778150) was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific. 1–1.2 × 10 6 HUVECs were transfected with 50 or 100 nm of control, VEGFR1, or VEGFR2 siRNA using RNAiMAX for 48 hours according to the manufacturer's instructions. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 RNA Isolation, Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis RNA was isolated from cells or tissues lysed in Trizol using a ThermoFisher PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Cat No: 12183025, ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined by NanoOne, and an equal amount of RNA was used to prepare cDNA using LunaScript RT SuperMix (New England BioLabs, Cat no: M3010L) according to the manufacturer's conditions. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed by TaqMan probes (Human VEGFR1 Taqman Assay ID: Hs01052961_m1, Human VEGFR2 Taqman Assay ID: Hs00911700_m1, Human VEGF‐A Taqman Probe Assay ID: Hs00900055_m1, Mouse VEGF‐A Taqman Assay ID: Mm00437306_m1, Human Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase [HPRT] Taqman Assay ID: Hs02800695_m1, Mouse HPRT Taqman Assay ID: Mm03024075_m1) using Luna Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Cat No: M3004) and Bio‐Rad CFX96 according to standard laboratory procedures. 23 , 28 , 29 HPRT was used to normalize gene expression. 28 , 36 The ∆∆Ct method was used to calculate relative gene expression values in qPCR analysis. Hypoxia Serum Starvation Cells were incubated in a starvation medium (Cell Applications, Cat No: 209–250) and subjected to hypoxia (2% O 2 ) for 24 hours. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 Cell Treatments Confluent ECs (~1.2×10 6 ) were challenged for HSS followed by treatment with 50 ng/mL of VEG 165 a, VEGF 165 b, or VEGF 165 b KD→RR for 10 minutes in EC starvation medium to determine changes in phosphorylation by western blot analysis. For in vitro tube formation assays, ECs were challenged with HSS in the presence of VEGF 165 a (50 ng/mL), VEGF 165 b KD→RR (50 ng/mL), P38 inhibitor ((S)‐p38 MAPK Inhibitor III, Cat No: 19696, Cayman Chemicals, 100 μmol/L 37 ) or a combination of VEGF 165 b KD→RR (50 ng/mL) and P38 inhibitor (100 μmol/L). DMSO (the same amount of volume used to treat cells with P38 inhibitor) was used as vehicle control. In Vitro Tube Formation Assay Post treatments, an equal number of ECs (20 000) were plated on growth factor reduced Matrigel (GFRM) in a 96‐well plate and the center concave images (covering ~80% of the well) were taken at 3‐to 6‐hour time intervals. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image J program with Angiogenesis Analyzer was used to quantify the nodes, junctions, and meshes on GFRM according to our previous publications. 24 , 28 , 29 , 33 Fluorescein Isothiocyanate ‐Dextran Permeability Assay HUVECs were cultured on 8.0 μm transwell inserts in 24‐well culture plates. At confluence, cells were treated with VEGF 165 a or VEGF 165 b KD→RR (50 ng/mL) and challenged with HSS for 24h. Post‐treatment, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐dextran (120 kD, 1 mg/mL) was added to the cells inside the transwell insert, and 50 μL aliquots from the bottom chamber of the cell culture plate were collected at 30‐minute intervals and the fluorescence intensity of the FITC‐dextran extravasated across the HUVEC monolayer to the bottom chamber was read using BioTek Synergy LX Multimode Fluorescent plate reader using fixed gain. 33 , 38 Phosphoproteome Arrays Phosphoproteome arrays were performed in HUVECs challenged for 24 hours with HSS, followed by treatment with 50 ng/mL of VEGF 165 a or VEGF 165 b KD→RR for 10 minutes using Human Phosphorylation Pathway Profiling Array C55 consisting of JAK–STAT, MAPK, AKT, TGF‐β, and NF‐kB signaling mediators (Cat No: AAH‐PPP‐1‐8, RayBiotech). Briefly, HUVECs were cultured in 100 mm cell culture dishes and at the confluence (~8×10 6 ) were challenged with HSS. Post treatment, HUVECs from two 100 mm dishes were lysed and RIPA cell lysis buffer to yield n=1 (n=3/group). The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove cell debris and phosphoproteome arrays were performed according to the Kit Array protocol. Data analysis was performed using NIH Image‐J by subtracting the background of an empty region between the dots from the dot intensity. Briefly, the average intensity of multiple nonoverlapping circles (n≥8, almost equal to the size of developed dots) encompassing areas between the developed dots in the membrane/blot was used to subtract the background from the dot (corresponding to individual protein) intensity on the membrane. Western Blot Analysis Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Cat No: sc‐24948A, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total protein was estimated using a BCA kit. At least 10 to 15 μg of cell or tissue lysate was resolved on SDS‐PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and western blotted for pVEGFR2/VEGFR2, pAKT (phospho protein kinase B)/AKT, pERK (phospho extracellular signal‐regulated protein kinase)/ERK, peNOS (phospho eNOS/eNOS), pSTAT3 (phosphor STAT3)/STAT3, pP38/P38, VEGF‐A, GAPDH, or actin antibodies according to the standard western blotting protocol. Western blot images were captured using iBright Imaging System. 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 Antibodies pVEGFR1 (Y1333‐Cat No: SAB4504006), pVEGFR2 (Y1175, Cat No: SAB4504567), VEGFR2 (Cat No: SAB4501643), and actin (Cat No: A2103) were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; VEGFR1 (Cat No: ab32152) was purchased from Abcam, Boston, MA, USA; VEGF‐A (Cat No: SC‐7269) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA; CD31 (Cat No: MA3105) was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA; VEGFR2 (Cat No: 55B11), pAKT (Cat No: 4060), AKT (Cat No: 4691), pERK1/2 (Cat No: 4370), ERK1/2 (Cat No: 9102), pSTAT3 (Cat No: 9145), STAT3 (Cat No: 12640), pP38 (Cat No: 4511), P38 (Cat No: 8690), and GAPDH (Cat No: 5174) were purchased from Cell Signaling and Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; eNOS (Cat No: 610299) and peNOS (Cat No: 612392) were purchased from BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA. Details of the antibody concentrations/dilutions used in the study were presented in Major Reagents‐Antibodies and Concentrations Table S1 . Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism 9 was used to determine the statistical significance of the data and generate graphical representations. Data were analyzed for equal variance using the F test. Data sets that passed the F test were analyzed by the unpaired t test for 2‐group comparisons or with 1‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's posttest for the comparison of multiple groups.

Necrosis scores were analyzed by the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. P <0.05 was considered significant. Phosphoproteome arrays were analyzed by multiple t tests with Holm–Sidak posttest and an adjusted P value<0.05 was considered significant. All data are expressed as the mean±SE.

RESULTS Replacement of KD Residues With RR in Antiangiogenic VEGF 165 b Isoform Results in a Recombinant VEGF 165 b KD → RR Isoform With Higher Angiogenic Capacity Predicting that a net positive charge endowed by arginine residues on VEGF‐A isoforms is necessary for VEGFR1 activation but not VEGFR2, we compared the C‐terminus 6‐amino acid sequences of VEGF 165 a, VEGF 165 b (ligands for both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) with VEGF‐B, and placental growth factor (specific ligands for VEGFR1). This comparison showed that the ligands that can activate VEGFR1 have arginine residues as the last 2 amino acids indicating that a positive charge on VEGF isoforms is needed for VEGFR1 autophosphorylation (Figure 1A ). To test our hypothesis, we developed a VEGF isoform wherein the KD residues in VEGF 165 b are switched to RR residues (V 165 b KD→RR , Figure 1B , Figure S1 ) and compared its ability to activate VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and their downstream signaling mediators. Western blot analysis using a pan VEGF‐A antibody that cannot distinguish VEGF‐A isoforms did not show any differences in the detection sensitivity or molecular weight changes among VEGF 165 a, VEGF 165 b, or VEGF 165 b KD→RR recombinant proteins (Figure S2A ). Furthermore, qPCR analysis of HUVECs transfected with VEGF 165 a or V 165 b KD→RR expressing plasmids using VEGF‐A TaqMan probes (which detect all VEGF‐A isoforms) also confirmed the expression of VEGF 165 a and V 165 b KD→RR mRNA (at comparable levels, albeit the mRNA expression may not be equivalent to protein levels, Figure S2B ).

We have previously shown that VEGF 165 b induces the activation of VEGFR2‐AKT‐ERK‐eNOS signaling to the same extent as VEGF 165 a in ischemic HUVECs. 24 However, unlike VEGF 165 a, VEGF 165 b cannot activate VEGFR1‐STAT3 signaling in ischemic ECs. 23 , 24 To determine whether the presence of RR residues in VEGF 165 a versus KD residues in VEGF 165 b isoforms regulates VEGFR2‐AKT‐ERK1/2 signaling versus VEGFR1‐STAT3 signaling, we performed western blot analysis of HSS ECs treated with VEGF 165 a or VEGF 165 b KD→RR and compared VEGFR2 signaling activation versus VEGFR1 signaling activation in HSS ECs. Western blot analysis (full‐length western blots presented in Figure S3 ) showed that both VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b KD→RR induced a significant increase pVEGFR2/VEGFR2 (Control [Con] versus V 165 a‐2.9X, Con versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR ‐4X; P <0.05, Figure 1C ), pAKT/AKT (Con versus V 165 a‐1.8X, Con versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR ‐1.7X; P <0.05, Figure 1D ), pERK/ERK (Con versus V 165 a‐1.9X, Con versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR ‐2.4X; P <0.05, Figure 1E ), and peNOS/eNOS (Con versus V 165 a‐2X, Con versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR ‐2.4X; P <0.05, Figure 1F ) activation compared with untreated controls. However, VEGF 165 b KD→RR was able to induce pVEGFR1/VEGFR1 (Con versus V 165 a‐2.1X, Con versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR ‐2.9X; P <0.05, Figure 1G ) and pSTAT3/STAT3 (Con versus V 165 a‐3.7X, Con versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR ‐2.5X; P <0.05, Figure 1H ) activation significantly higher than untreated controls and similar to VEGF 165 a. Furthermore, consistent with our previous studies, VEGF 165 b induced pVR2/VR2 (Figure S4A ), pAKT/AKT (Figure S4B ), and pERK/ERK (Figure S4C ) activation significantly higher compared with untreated controls (to the same extent as VEGF 165 b KD→RR ) but not peNOS/eNOS (Figure S4D ), pVEGFR1/VEGFR1 (Figure S4E ), or pSTAT3/STAT3 (Figure S4F ) activation in HSS ECs. These data supported our hypothesis that the KD residues in VEGF 165 b isoforms decrease VEGFR1 autophosphorylation. We next wanted to determine whether the KD to RR switch can also endow the VEGF 165 b KD→RR isoform with pro‐angiogenic properties. Surprisingly, in vitro tube formation assay showed that VEGF 165 b KD→RR treatment significantly increased the angiogenic capacity of HSS ECs on growth factor reduced Matrigel (GFRM) compared with VEGF 165 b (Figure S4G ), VEGF 165 a, or untreated controls ( P <0.05, Figure 1I ). VEGFR1 silencing (Figure S5A ) significantly decreased the angiogenic capacity of VEGF 165 b KD→RR in HSS ECs. (Figure S5B ), indicating that the RR to KD switch contributes to the VEGFR1 inhibitory capacity of VEGF 165 b isoforms that results in blocking the ischemic‐EC angiogenic capacity. Because VEGF 165 a is well known to induce vascular permeability, we next determined whether VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces vascular permeability higher than VEGF 165 a. FITC‐dextran permeability experiments using HSS ECs cultured on 8.0 μm transwell inserts showed that both VEGF 165 a (2 hours 30 minutes: P =0.046, 3 hours: P =0.025) and VEGF 165 b KD→RR (2 hours 30 minutes: P =0.042, 3 hours: P =0.018) significantly induced HSS EC vascular permeability compared with untreated controls. No significant difference in FITC‐dextran extravasation was observed between VEGF 165 a versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs (Figure 1J ). VEGF 165 b KD → RR Enhances Perfusion Recovery in Balb/ cJ Ischemic Muscle Higher Than VEGF 165 a Because VEGF 165 b KD→RR significantly induced the HSS EC angiogenic capacity even higher than VEGF 165 a, we wanted to determine whether VEGF 165 b KD→RR can enhance perfusion recovery in a preclinical PAD model that shows poor perfusion recovery post HLI. 23 , 26 , 27 , 29 In preclinical PAD models, Balb/cJ mice cannot elicit a potent angiogenic response in ischemic muscle that is necessary to improve perfusion recovery. 26 , 27 Recent studies from our group have shown that VEGF 165 a treatment cannot induce perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ mice in the experimental‐PAD model. 35 Based on the ability of VEGF 165 b KD→RR to induce both VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 signaling activation, we hypothesized that VEGF 165 b KD→RR can achieve a therapeutic perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ mice where VEGF 165 a delivery has failed. 35 To determine the role of VEGF 165 b KD→RR in regulating perfusion recovery, Balb/cJ mice skeletal muscle was electroporated with a control, VEGF 165 a expressing, or VEGF 165 b KD→RR expressing plasmids in the experimental‐PAD model. Western blot and qPCR analysis confirmed increased expression of VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b KD→RR at both protein (Figure S6A ) and mRNA (Figure S6B ) levels in the ischemic muscle compared with control plasmid. The expression of VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b KD→RR in the ischemic muscle is comparable between the 2 groups (Figures S6A and S6B ). Consistent with our recently published data, laser speckle perfusion recovery in these mice groups showed that VEGF 165 a was not able to significantly induce perfusion recovery in the ischemic muscle compared with the control plasmid (d21: Control plasmid‐0.66±0.08, VEGF 165 a plasmid‐0.71±0.1, Figure 2A ). However, VEGF 165 b KD→RR expressing plasmid showed a significant increase in perfusion recovery in the ischemic muscle compared with the control plasmid (d21: Control plasmid‐0.66±0.08, VEGF 165 b KD→RR plasmid‐0.88±0.06, P =0.043, Figure 2A ) and numerical increase in perfusion recovery compared with VEGF 165 a (d21: VEGF 165 a plasmid‐0.71±0.1, VEGF 165 b KD→RR plasmid‐0.88±0.06, P =0.055). Next, to determine whether the enhanced perfusion recovery achieved by VEGF 165 b KD→RR also results in increased vascular permeability, we performed Evans Blue vascular permeability experiments in vivo. Evans Blue extravasation experiment showed a significant increase in the accumulation of Evans blue dye in the ischemic muscle of mice treated with the control plasmid ( P =0.001) versus nonischemic (Figure 2B ). Both VEGF 165 a ( P =0.0003) and VEGF 165 b KD→RR ( P =0.03) further increased the vascular permeability to the same extent in ischemic muscle compared with control plasmid‐treated ischemic muscle (Figure 2B ). Figure 2 VEGF 165 b KD→RR but not VEGF 165 a induces perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle, a chronic limb threatening ischemia‐peripheral artery disease model.

Consistent with changes in the laser speckle perfusion recovery, immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 and PCNA that will simultaneously provide the microvascular density and EC proliferation measurements showed that VEGF 165 a treatment numerically increased microvascular density (CD31+ ECs/mm 2 , P =0.07) and proliferating ECs (PCNA+CD31+ECs/mm 2 , P =0.08) in ischemic muscle, whereas VEGF 165 b KD→RR significantly induced microvascular density (CD31+ ECs/mm 2 , P =0.048) and proliferating ECs ( P =0.03) in the ischemic muscle compared with control plasmid (Figure 3 ) indicating that VEGF 165 b KD→RR was able to induce significantly higher microvascular density to achieve therapeutic perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle in experimental‐PAD. These data, although presenting evidence on the role of RR residues in regulating VEGF isoforms' angiogenic capacity, further demonstrated that replacing the KD to RR in the VEGF 165 b isoform resulted in the development of a novel recombinant VEGF‐A isoform (VEGF 165 b KD→RR ) with potent angiogenic activity higher than VEGF 165 a and that is capable of achieving perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle.

Phosphoproteome Arrays Reveal P38 as a Potential Downstream Effector of VEGF 165 b KD→RR Induced Proangiogenic Activity Western blot analysis of principal/classical VEGFR2 signaling mediators including AKT‐ERK‐eNOS; and VEGFR1‐STAT3 signaling did not show any significant differences in the extent of their activation between VEGF 165 a versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs. However, VEGF 165 b KD→RR was able to induce significantly higher ischemic‐EC angiogenic capacity versus VEGF 165 a in vitro; and was able to induce perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle versus VEGF 165 a in vivo suggesting the activation of additional signaling mediators downstream of VEGF 165 b KD→RR . Hence, we performed Phosphoproteome arrays consisting of key signaling mediators in MAPK, AKT, JAK–STAT, NF‐kB, and TGF‐β signaling pathways in VEGF 165 a versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs and screened for the signaling mediators that are involved in mediating proangiogenic effects of VEGF 165 b KD→RR in ischemic ECs. AKT Pathway AKT Phosphoarray showed no significant differences (adjusted P value (q)<0.05 considered significant) between HSS ECs treated with VEGF 165 b KD→RR versus VEGF 165 a (Figure 4A , Figure S7 , Table S2 ).

JAK / STAT Pathway JAK/STAT Phosphoarray showed a significant decrease (q<0.05) in the phosphorylation of JAK/STAT signaling mediators including EGFR S1070 , JAK1 T1022 , JAK2 T1007/1008 , SHP1 S591 , SHP2 T542 , SRC T419 , STAT2 T689 , STAT T705 , STAT5 T694 , STAT6 T641 , and TYK T1054 in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs versus VEGF165a (Figure 4B , Figure S7 , Table S2 ). MAPK Pathway MAPK Phosphoarray showed a significant increase in P38 T180/Y182 (marked in red box) in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs versus VEGF165a (Figure 4C , Figure S7 , Table S2 ). NF ‐ kB Pathway NF‐kB Phosphoarray that consisted predominantly of inflammatory signaling mediators showed a significant decrease in all of the members including ATM S1981 , eIF2a S51 , HDAC2 S394 , HDAC4 S632 , IkBa S32 , MSK1 S376 , NFkB S536 , TAK1 S412 , TBK1 S172 , and ZAP70 Y292 in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs versus VEGF165a (Figure 4D , Figure S7 , Table S2 ). TGF ‐β Pathway TFG‐β Phosphoarray showed a significant increase in SMAD1 S463/465 in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs versus VEGF165a (Figure 4E , Figure S7 , Table S2 ). Among the proteins in the pathway arrays that are significantly decreased or increased in VEGF 165 b KD→RR versus VEGF 165 a treated HSS ECs, P38 T180/Y182 showed the highest fold change in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated HSS ECs versus VEGF 165 a. Hence, we next wanted to determine whether the proangiogenic effects of VEGF 165 b KD→RR are partly mediated by P38 activation in ischemic ECs. Western blot analysis confirmed that VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces significantly higher pP38/P38 activation compared with VEGF 165 a in HSS ECs ( P <0.05, Figure 4F , Figure S8 ) validating our phosphoproteome array data. These data indicated that P38 is a possible downstream regulator of VEGF 165 b KD→RR pro‐angiogenic activity in HSS ECs. VEGF 165 b KD→RR Induces Both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 Activation to Achieve Perfusion Recovery in Experimental‐ PAD We next wanted to determine whether the enhanced perfusion recovery observed in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated Balb/cJ ischemic muscle is due to its ability to activate both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 signaling in experimental‐PAD. Western blot analysis of Balb/cJ non‐ischemic muscle, ischemic muscle treated with a control plasmid, VEGF 165 a plasmid, or with VEGF 165 b KD→RR plasmid at day 3 post‐HLI showed that ischemia‐induced VEGFR1 levels compared with non‐ischemic muscle. However, this increase in VEGFR1 levels is not accompanied by an increase in the pVEGFR1 activation in ischemic muscle versus non‐ischemic. VEGF 165 a induced a modest increase in pVEGFR1/VEGFR1 activation in the ischemic muscle that did not reach statistical significance compared with the control ischemic muscle. However, VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated ischemic muscle showed a significant increase in pVEGFR1/VEGFR1 activation compared with control ischemic muscle (Figure 5A , Figure S9 ). Figure 5 VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces the activation of STAT3 and P38 higher than VEGF 165 a in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle dependent on both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation. Western blot analysis of ( A ) pVEGFR1/VEGFR1, ( B ) pVEGFR2/VEGFR2, ( C ) pSTAT3/STAT3, ( D ) pP38/P38 in Balb/cJ Non‐Isc or Isc treated with control plasmid (n=5), VEGF 165 a expressing plasmid (n=5) or V 165 b KD→RR expressing plasmid (n=5).

Con indicates control; Isc, ischemic muscle; KD, lysine‐aspartic acid; Non‐Isc, nonischemic muscle; P38, mitogen‐activated protein kinase‐14; Pld, plasmid; pP38, phospho mitogen‐activated protein kinase‐14; pSTAT3, phospho signal transducers and activators of transcription‐3; RR, arginine‐arginine; STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription‐3; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; and VEGFR1/2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/2. We next examined whether VEGF 165 b KD→RR induced VEGFR1 activation is followed by the downstream STAT3 activation. Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease in STAT3 activation in ischemic muscle versus non‐ischemic. Although VEGF 165 a did not induce a significant increase in pSTAT3/STAT3 activation in ischemic muscle, VEGF 165 b KD→RR significantly induced STAT3 activation in ischemic muscle compared with control ischemic muscle (Figure 5B , Figure S9 ). Subsequently, western blot analysis to determine the extent of VEGFR2 activation in VEGF 165 a versus VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated ischemic muscle samples showed that, unlike VEGFR1 activation, ischemia‐induced a significant increase in VEGFR2 activation compared with non‐ischemic. However, although VEGF 165 a was not able to further increase the VEGFR2 activation in ischemic muscle, VEGF 165 b KD→RR was able to significantly induce pVEGFR2/VEGFR2 activation compared with control ischemic muscle (Figure 5C , Figure S9 ). Phosphoproteome arrays showed that the VEGF 165 b KD→RR induced the highest fold change in P38 T180/Y182 compared with VEGF 165 a. Hence, we wanted to determine how P38 activation plays a role in regulating the perfusion recovery achieved by VEGF 165 b KD→RR in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle. Similar to VEGFR2 activation in ischemic versus non‐ischemic muscle, western blot analysis showed a significant increase in pP38/P38 activation in ischemic muscle versus non‐ischemic. Although VEGF 165 a was not able to further induce pP38/P38 activation, VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated ischemic muscle showed a significant increase in pP38/P38 activation compared with control ischemic muscle (Figure 5D , Figure S9 ). Because VEGF 165 b KD→RR induced both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation in ischemic ECs, we wanted to determine whether VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 is the major receptor tyrosine kinase that activates STAT3 and P38 in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated ischemic ECs. After confirming VEGFR1 (Figure S5A ) and VEGFR2 silencing (Figure S10A ), ECs were challenged with HSS followed by treatment with or without VEGF 165 b KD→RR . VEGF 165 b KD→RR significantly induced pSTAT3/STAT3 activation in ischemic ECs. However, silencing VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 resulted in the loss of VEGF 165 b KD→RR ability to induce pSTAT3/STAT3 activation in ischemic ECs indicating that both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 kinase activities regulate STAT3 activation in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated in ischemic ECs (Figure 5E , Figure S10B ). Consistently, western blot analysis showed that VEGF 165 b KD→RR treatment significantly induced pP38/P38 activation in HSS ECs transfected with control siRNA (Figure 5F , Figure S10B ). However, silencing either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 resulted in the loss of VEGF 165 b KD→RR ability to induce p38/P38 activation indicating that the kinase activities of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 regulate the P38 activation in VEGF 165 b KD→RR treated in ischemic ECs. These data indicated that the ability of VEGF 165 b KD→RR to achieve the activation of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 signaling pathways in the ischemic muscle contributed to the perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle. P38 Regulates the Downstream Proangiogenic Capacity of VEGF 165 b KD→RR in Ischemic ECs Although we have shown that STAT3 activation increases the angiogenic capacity of ischemic ECs, the role of P38 activation in regulating ischemic‐EC angiogenic capacity in PAD is not clear. Hence, we next confirmed whether VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces EC specific pP38/P38 activation in ischemic muscle by performing double immunofluorescence analysis of pP38 and CD31 in ischemic muscle treated with control plasmid, ischemic muscle treated with VEGF 165 a plasmid or VEGF 165 b KD→RR plasmid. Interestingly, quantification of pP38 and CD31 showed that VEGF 165 a treatment significantly induced the number of ECs positive for activated pP38 (CD31+pP38+) compared with control ischemic muscle. However, VEGF 165 b KD→RR induced significantly higher CD31+pP38+ ECs compared with VEGF 165 a treated ischemic muscle (Figure 6A ) indicating that VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces the pro‐angiogenic capacity of ischemic ECs by increasing P38 activation in experimental‐PAD. Figure 6 VEGF 165 b KD→RR increases higher numbers of pP38+ ECs in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle compared with VEGF 165 a.

Next, to confirm whether P38 regulates VEGF 165 b KD•RR induced pro‐angiogenic effects in ischemic ECs, we treated HSS ECs with P38 inhibitor in the presence or absence of VEGF 165 b KD→RR . In vitro tube formation assay showed that although VEGF 165 b KD→RR significantly induced the number of nodes, junctions, and meshes on GFRM compared with control, P38 inhibition significantly decreased the number of nodes, junctions, and meshes compared with control. VEGF 165 b KD→RR treatment did not induce the numbers of nodes, junctions, or meshes in the presence of P38 inhibitor in ischemic ECs indicating that P38 is essential for VEGF 165 b KD→RR to induce the pro‐angiogenic capacity of ischemic ECs (Figure 6B ). DISCUSSION VEGF‐A is one of the highly sought‐after therapeutics for PAD. 5 Despite VEGF‐A's ability to induce potent angiogenesis by activating VEGFR2 in murine models, clinical trials were not successful. 6 Studies from our group and others showing that ischemia induces the production of an anti‐angiogenic VEGF‐A splice variant in ischemic muscle offered an explanation that underlies the clinical failure of VEGF‐A. 23 , 39 Alternate splicing in VEGF‐A is not uncommon. In fact, alternate splicing in VEGF‐A results in multiple VEGF‐A splice variants ranging from VEGF‐A 206 to VEGF‐A 121 that retain or lack the heparin‐binding sites conferring their affinities to be retained by the extracellular matrix or secreted into the circulation. 14 , 40 Despite the occurrence of alternative splice sites in exons‐6, −7 and −8, only the splice variants that occur due to the distal splice selection in exon‐8 demonstrate anti‐angiogenic properties. 16 Previous studies by Waltenberger et al 41 and Sawano et al 42 showed that the binding affinity of V 165 a to VEGFR1 is ~1 to 16 pmol/L, whereas for VEGFR2 it is ~410 to 760 pmol/L. Both pro‐angiogenic VEGF 165 a and anti‐angiogenic VEGF 165 b isoforms have the same binding sites for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. In our efforts to understand the molecular mechanism by which VEGF 165 b inhibits ischemic angiogenesis, we showed that VEGF 165 b induces VEGFR2 signaling in ischemic ECs almost to the same extent as VEGF 165 a but fails to activate VEGFR1 in ischemic ECs. 23 , 24 Furthermore, by expressing VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 in HEK293 cells that lack VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 (to limit the crosstalk between VEGFR1 and VEGFR2), we showed that VEGF 165 b is an antagonistic ligand for VEGFR1 but is an agonist for VEGFR2. 23 These data indicated that despite the same binding sites for VEGFR1 (in exon‐3) and VEGFR2 (in exon‐4) VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b 44 may differently regulate VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation. To address the reason behind VEGF 165 b's ability to activate VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1, we first looked at the ligands that can activate only VEGFR1 but have limited VEGFR2 activation capacity. VEGF‐B and PlGF are VEGFR1‐specific ligands, whereas VEGF 165 a is a pan‐ligand for both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. 43 A comparison of the 6 amino acid sequences between these VEGF‐B, PlGF, and VEGF‐A isoforms shows that a commonality among the ligands that can activate VEGFR1 is the presence of RR residues in the 8th exon C‐terminus that are absent in the VEGF 165 b isoform. Based on this observation, we questioned whether the strength of the positive charge conferred by RR residues is necessary for VEGFR1 activation but is dispensable for VEGFR2 activation. 14 According to our hypothesis, and consistent with our recent report that showed that VEGF 165 b induces VEGFR2 signaling to the same extent as VEGF 165 a, we observed that the replacement of KD residues to RR in VEGF 165 b was sufficient to activate VEGFR2‐AKT‐ERK signaling to the same extent as VEGF 165 a. However, although VEGF 165 b failed to induce VEGFR1‐STAT3 signaling in ischemic ECs, 24 VEGF 165 b KD→RR was able to activate VEGFR1‐STAT3 signaling. The data showed that the replacement of RR to KD residues regulates the VEGFR1 inhibitory property of VEGF 165 b isoforms in ischemic ECs. A previous study by Kawamura et al 20 shows that VEGF 165 b binding induces only weak and transient VEGFR2 activation due to the rapid closure of ATP binding sites and inadequate VEGFR2 internal rotation. Hence, the anti‐angiogenic function of VEGF 165 b has been attributed to its capacity to decrease VEGFR2 activation. Consistent with the VEGFR2 inhibitory function of VEGF 165 b, Kikuchi et al 39 have shown peripheral blood monocytes from patients with PAD express higher levels of VEGF 165 b compared with controls to inhibit ischemic muscle revascularization and VEGF 165 b inhibition by intramuscular delivery of a VEGF 165 b specific monoclonal antibody improved perfusion recovery in PAD models. The conclusion derived in Kikuchi et al 39 along with other VEGF 165 b studies reaffirmed the hypothesis that VEGF 165 b inhibits the canonical R2‐PI3K‐AKT‐ERK‐eNOS signaling to inhibit angiogenesis. Using a similar strategy of VEGF 165 b inhibition followed by Kikuchi et al 39 we also showed the therapeutic benefit of VEGF 165 b inhibition in promoting perfusion recovery in preclinical PAD model. 23 However, in an experimental‐PAD model using Balb/c mice that recapitulates the pathology of chronic limb‐threatening ischemia 4 , 6 with high necrosis incidence, severe loss of muscle, and impaired angiogenic capacity, VEGF 165 b inhibition did not induce VEGFR2 signaling activation but induced VEGFR1 signaling activation. 23 By isolating ECs from ischemic muscle and in vitro EC cultures, we showed that VEGF 165 b inhibition induces pVEGFR1 Y1333‐ pSTAT3 signaling in ECs 23 to enhance perfusion recovery. Consistent with these data, a previous study by Nishi et al 44 demonstrated that VEGFR1 inhibition induces excessive AKT and P53 activation to decrease neovascularization and perfusion recovery in experimental‐PAD. More important, Clayton et al demonstrate that VEGFR1 +/− HLI mice have significantly impaired perfusion compared with VEGFR2 +/− or wild‐type HLI mice indicating that VEGFR1 plays critical roles in modulating HLI functional outcomes. 45 Furthermore, Amano et al 46 also showed that VEGFR1‐kinase deficient mice have significantly lower perfusion compared with wild‐type mice and demonstrate that failure in the recruitment of CXCR4 + VEGFR1 + cells from the bone marrow of VEGFR1‐tytosine kinase deficient mice is one of the contributing factors in impaired perfusion recovery. Although the western blot analysis confirmed that RR residues play an important role in regulating the VEGFR1 versus VEGFR2 activation capacity of VEGF‐A isoforms, we unexpectedly noticed that VEGF 165 b KD→RR was able to induce ischemic angiogenesis higher than VEGF 165 a in vitro. Theoretically, the replacement of KD to RR should endow VEGF 165 b KD→RR with angiogenic capacity equivalent to VEGF 165 a, because there was no statistical difference in the extent of VEGFR2‐AKT‐ERK‐eNOS signaling or VEGFR1‐STAT3 signaling induced by VEGF 165 b KD→RR versus VEGF 165 a. Hence, to identify the molecular signaling events that could have contributed to the superior pro‐angiogenic capacity of VEGF 165 b KD→RR over VEGF 165 a, we performed phosphoproteome arrays that consisted of 5 key receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. VEGFR2 signaling is extremely complex with multiple intersecting pathways and signaling mediators. The phosphoproteome arrays that encompassed the 5 signaling pathways are only a snippet of the much more complex/larger signaling networks regulated by VEGFR2 (and VEGFR1). However, within the phosphoproteome arrays that were analyzed in this study, P38 T180/Y182 showed the highest fold‐change in ischemic ECs treated with VEGF 165 b KD→RR versus VEGF 165 a. Although we identified P38 as a potential downstream angiogenic regulator of VEGF 165 b KD→RR , other signaling mediators could very well play a role in regulating the downstream angiogenic effects of VEGF 165 b KD→RR . For example, VEGF 165 b KD→RR treatment decreased several pro‐inflammatory NF‐kB signaling mediators in ischemic ECs suggesting that one of the mechanisms by which VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces ischemic‐EC angiogenic capacity is via decreasing the pro‐inflammatory environment in ischemic vasculature. 35 Both P38 and STAT3 are well known to be activated by VEGF‐A: VEGFR2 signaling. 47 , 48 , 49 However, although limited information is available on VEGFR1 regulating STAT3, 23 previous reports have shown that PlGF can also induce P38, AKT, and STAT3 phosphorylation in hypoxic vascular smooth muscle cells through VEGFR1 activation. 50 , 51 Furthermore, Tchaikovski et al 52 showed that both VEGF‐A and PlGF induce P38 activation in human peripheral blood monocytes indicating that P38 is a common downstream signaling mediator of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation by VEGF 165 b KD→RR . Accordingly, silencing either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 failed to induce P38 activation by VEGF 165 b KD→RR in ischemic‐ECs. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of P38 blocked the pro‐angiogenic capacity of VEGF 165 b KD→RR indicating that P38 contributes to the downstream angiogenic effects of VEGF 165 b KD→RR in ischemic ECs. Furthermore, P38 is known to be integral to the angiogenesis process by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, a necessary step to form new blood vessels. Recent reports by Sahun‐Espanol et al 53 have shown that P38 activator anisomycin induces vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation to promote arteriogenesis and perfusion recovery in the experimental‐PAD model. The therapeutic significance of VEGF 165 b KD→RR is reflected in our in vitro capillary tube formation experiments and in vivo perfusion recovery experiments where the treatment/delivery of VEGF 165 b KD→RR induced perfusion recovery in Balb/cJ ischemic muscle by inducing the angiogenic capacity of ischemic ECs significantly higher than VEGF 165 a. However, the mechanisms by which VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces ischemic angiogenesis higher than VEGF 165 a still need further investigation. We have previously shown that VEGF 165 b inhibition (using an isoform‐specific monoclonal antibody) enhances perfusion recovery. However, this enhanced perfusion recovery is associated with increased VEGFR1 activation and decreased VEGFR2 activation. Unlike VEGF 165 b inhibition, delivery of VEGF 165 b KD→RR induced the activation of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, which significantly induced P38 activation. This higher P38 activation as a resultant of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation by VEGF 165 b KD→RR contributed to the enhanced perfusion recovery compared with VEGF 165 a (which can induce VEGFR2 activation but not VEGFR1 activation in the presence of VEGF 165 b) in PAD. A schematic to explain the mechanism that regulates P38 activity in response to VEGF 165 b KD→RR is presented in Figure 7 . Furthermore, we predict that replacement of KD with RR residues resulted in SLT R RR sequence in VEGF 165 b KD→RR (with a total of 3 arginine residues in the C‐terminus) versus CDK P RR (with a total of 2 arginine residues in the C‐terminus, proline has neutral charge) 33 , 54 indicating that a higher positive charge in VEGF 165 b KD→RR. This could explain the higher angiogenic capacity of VEGF 165 b KD→RR over VEGF 165 a. Figure 7 Schematic of the proposed mechanism and signaling by which VEGF 165 b KD→RR induces ischemic angiogenesis and perfusion recovery in PAD. VEGF 165 a cannot activate VEGFR1 signaling in the presence of VEGF 165 b. However, the KD to RR switch (in VEGF 165 b isoform) results in endowing VEGF 165 b KD→RR isoform its ability to bind and induce both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation. Activation of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 results in increased P38 activation that promotes ischemic endothelial angiogenic capacity in PAD. KD, lysine‐aspartic acid; PAD, peripheral artery disease; pAKT, phospho protein kinase B; peNOS, phopho endothelial nitrous oxide synthase; pERK, phospho extracellular signal‐regulated protein kinase; pP38, phospho mitogen‐activated protein kinase‐14; pSTAT3, phospho signal transducers and activators of transcription‐3; RR, arginine‐arginine; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; and VEGFR1/2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/2. CONCLUSIONS Currently no medical therapies can induce angiogenesis and provide perfusion relief to patients with PAD. In our studies aimed at understanding the mechanism by which VEGF 165 b induces VEGFR2 activation but blocks VEGFR1 activation, we have discovered that switching the KD residues to RR in VEGF 165 b isoform results in a novel potent VEGF‐A isoform that can induce ischemic‐EC angiogenic capacity and promote perfusion recovery higher than VEGF 165 a. A previous report by Babiak et al 55 before the discovery of VEGF 165 b demonstrated that a coordinated activation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 is important to promote better recovery than activating either receptor alone. Accordingly, the ability of VEGF 165 b KD→RR to induce both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation in ischemic ECs and achieve a therapeutic perfusion recovery presents VEGF 165 b KD→RR as a potential therapy for PAD.

  "plain_text": "Background Alternative splicing in the eighth exon C‐terminus of VEGF‐A (vascular endothelial growth factor‐A) results in the formation of proangiogenic VEGF 165 a and antiangiogenic VEGF 165 b isoforms. The only known difference between these 2 isoform families is a 6‐amino acid switch from CDKPRR (in VEGF 165 a) to SLTRKD (in VEGF 165 b). We have recently shown that VEGF 165 b can induce VEGFR2‐activation but fails to induce VEGFR1 (VEGF receptor 1)‐activation. The molecular mechanisms that regulate VEGF 165 b's ability toward differential VEGFR2 versus VEGFR1 activation/inhibition are not yet clear. Methods and Results Hypoxia serum starvation was used as an in vitro peripheral artery disease model. Unilateral single ligation of the femoral artery was used as a preclinical peripheral artery disease model. VEGFR1 activating ligands have 2 arginine (RR) residues in their eighth exon C‐terminus, that were replaced by lysine‐aspartic acid (KD) in VEGF 165 b. A synthetic anti‐angiogenic VEGF 165 b splice variant in which the KD residues were switched to RR (VEGF 165 b KD→RR ) activated both VEGFR1‐ and VEGFR2‐signaling pathways to induce ischemic‐endothelial cell angiogenic capacity in vitro and enhance perfusion recovery in a severe experimental‐peripheral artery disease model significantly higher than VEGF 165 a. Phosphoproteome arrays showed that the therapeutic efficacy of VEGF 165 b KD→RR over VEGF 165 a is due to its ability to induce P38‐activation in ischemic endothelial cells. Conclusions Our data shows that the KD residues regulate VEGF 165 b's VEGFR1 inhibitory property but not VEGFR2. Switching these KD residues to RR resulted in the formation of a synthetic/recombinant VEGF 165 b KD→RR isoform that has the ability to activate both VEGFR1‐ and VEGFR2‐signaling and induce ischemic‐endothelial cell angiogenic and proliferative capacity that matched the angiogenic requirement necessary to achieve perfusion recovery in a severe experimental‐peripheral artery disease model."
