    "abstract_text": "Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregate to form amyloid fibrils that deposit in tissues and are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type II diabetes (T2D), respectively. Individuals with T2D have an increased risk of developing AD, and conversely, AD patients have an increased risk of developing T2D. Evidence suggests that this link between AD and T2D might originate from a structural similarity between aggregates of A\u03b2 and hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method microelectron diffraction, we determined the atomic structures of 11-residue segments from both A\u03b2 and hIAPP, termed A\u03b2(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G, with 64% sequence similarity. We observed a high degree of structural similarity between their backbone atoms (0.96-\u00c5 root mean square deviation). Moreover, fibrils of these segments induced amyloid formation through self- and cross-seeding. Furthermore, inhibitors designed for one segment showed cross-efficacy for full-length A\u03b2 and hIAPP and reduced cytotoxicity of both proteins, although by apparently blocking different cytotoxic mechanisms. The similarity of the atomic structures of A\u03b2(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G offers a molecular model for cross-seeding between A\u03b2 and hIAPP.",
