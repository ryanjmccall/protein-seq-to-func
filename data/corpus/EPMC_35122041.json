  "abstract_text": "Metabolic reprogramming is a core hallmark of cancer but it remains poorly defined in hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC). Here we show that hepatic aldolase B (Aldob) suppresses HCC by directly binding and inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). A stage-dependent decrease of Aldob and increase of G6PD in human tumors are correlated with poor prognosis for patients with HCC. Global or liver-specific Aldob knockout promotes tumorigenesis in mice through enhancing G6PD activity and pentose phosphate pathway metabolism, whereas pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of G6PD suppresses HCC. Consistently, restoration of Aldob in Aldob knockout mice attenuates tumorigenesis. We further demonstrate that Aldob potentiates p53-mediated inhibition of G6PD in an Aldob-G6PD-p53 complex. This scaffolding effect is independent of Aldob enzymatic activity. Together, our study reveals a new mode of metabolic reprogramming in HCC due to the loss of Aldob, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.",
