    "abstract_text": "Cholesterol esterification and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation are the crucial events in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. The objective of this study was to analyse cholesterol esterification and the expression of MDR1 (multidrug resistance), ACAT (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase) and caveolin-1 genes in atherosclerotic and healthy vascular walls, in SMCs obtained from atherosclerotic lesions and saphenous veins. Results demonstrated higher levels of cholesterol esters, ACAT and MDR1 mRNAs and lower levels of caveolin-1 mRNA in atherosclerotic segments compared to adjacent serial sections of the same artery and the corresponding non-atherosclerotic arteries from cadaveric donors. SMCs isolated from atherosclerotic plaques manifested an increased capacity to esterify cholesterol and to grow at a faster rate than SMCs isolated from saphenous veins. In addition, when SMCs from atherosclerotic plaques were cultured in the presence of progesterone, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol esterification, significant growth suppression was observed. An increase in ACAT and MDR1 expression and a concomitant decrease in caveolin-1 expression were also observed in SMCs isolated from atherosclerotic arteries as early as 12 h after serum stimulation. An opposite pattern was found when SMCs were treated with progesterone. These findings support the idea that cholesterol esterification plays a role both in early atherogenesis and in clinical progression of advanced lesions and raise the possibility that the cholesterol ester pathway might directly modulate the proliferation of SMCs.",
