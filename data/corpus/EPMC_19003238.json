  "abstract_text": "Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of linear chromosomes that were originally defined functionally based on observations first by Muller (1938) and subsequently by McClintock (1941) that naturally occurring chromosome ends do not behave as double-stranded DNA breaks, in spite of the fact that they are the physical end of a linear, duplex DNA molecule. Double-stranded DNA breaks are highly unstable entities, being susceptible to nucleolytic attack and giving rise to chromosome rearrangements through end-to-end fusions and recombination events. In contrast, telomeres confer stability upon chromosome termini, as evidenced by the fact that chromosomes are extraordinarily stable through multiple cell divisions and even across evolutionary time. This protective function of telomeres is due to the formation of a nucleoprotein complex that sequesters the end of the DNA molecule, rendering it inaccessible to nucleases and recombinases as well as preventing the telomere from activating the DNA damage checkpoint pathways. The capacity of a functional end-protective complex to form is dependent upon maintenance of sufficient telomeric DNA. We have learned a great deal about telomere structure and how this specialized nucleoprotein complex confers stability on chromosome ends since the original observations that defined telomeres were made. This review summarizes our current understanding of mammalian telomere replication, structure and function.",
