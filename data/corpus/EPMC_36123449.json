    "abstract_text": "Ternatin-family cyclic peptides inhibit protein synthesis by targeting the eukaryotic elongation factor-1\u03b1. A potentially related cytotoxic natural product ('A3') was isolated from Aspergillus, but only 4 of its 11 stereocentres could be assigned. Here, we synthesized SR-A3 and SS-A3-two out of 128 possible A3 epimers-and discovered that synthetic SR-A3 is indistinguishable from naturally derived A3. Relative to SS-A3, SR-A3 exhibits an enhanced residence time and rebinding kinetics, as revealed by single-molecule fluorescence imaging of elongation reactions catalysed by eukaryotic elongation factor-1\u03b1 in vitro. An increased residence time-stereospecifically conferred by the unique \u03b2-hydroxyl in SR-A3-was also observed in cells. Consistent with its prolonged duration of action, thrice-weekly dosing with SR-A3 led to a reduced tumour burden and increased survival in an aggressive Myc-driven mouse lymphoma model. Our results demonstrate the potential of SR-A3 as a cancer therapeutic and exemplify an evolutionary mechanism for enhancing cyclic peptide binding kinetics via stereospecific side-chain hydroxylation.",
