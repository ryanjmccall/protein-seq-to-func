    "abstract_text": "Cytokines have critical functions in regulating immune responses. A large number of these factors bind related receptors termed the Type I and Type II families of cytokine receptors. These receptors activate Janus kinases (Jaks) and Stat family of transcription factors. The essential and specific function of Jaks and Stats is particularly well illustrated by human and mouse mutations. The possibility that these molecules could be targeted to produce novel immunosuppressive compounds is considered in this review.",
