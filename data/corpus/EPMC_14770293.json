    "abstract_text": "The steroid hormone estrogen and signaling from its receptors are increasingly recognized as critical mediators of a variety of organ-specific biological processes. Recent advances in the identification and functional characterization of novel estrogen receptor interacting proteins clearly show the complexity of hormonal signaling regulation, but may also contribute to our understanding of the roles of estrogen signaling in normal physiology and the pathobiology of human disease.",
