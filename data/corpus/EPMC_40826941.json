Introduction Nitric oxide (NO) is a small, gaseous signaling molecule playing important roles in various physiological and pathological processes in the body and is produced by different isoforms of NO synthases (NOS). 1 2 It is a free radical involved in vasodilation, neurotransmission, cell signaling, immune response and many other processes. The inducible NOS (iNOS) enzyme is the only one among the known three isoforms of NOS producing large amounts of NO as part of the immune response to inflammatory stimuli (such as infections or immune activation) and oxidative stress. Numerous cell types in the organism, including neuroglial cells and other macrophages, have the ability to produce NO in response to the influence of cytokines, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and other agents triggering the stress. iNOS produces an abundance of NO, which cytostatically affects the parasitic target cells such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. 2 3 The other isoforms of NOS (endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS)) are calcium-calmodulin controlled isoenzymes, which constitutively expressed in both central and peripheral neurons as well as some other cell types. Among their roles are vasodilatation, blood pressure control, smooth muscle relaxation, and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). 4 Both nNOS and eNOS are calcium-dependent and mostly expressed in neurons and epithelial cells, respectively. On the other hand, a range of cells, such as microglial and other immune cells, can produce calcium-independent iNOS upon activation by cytokines or other stimuli. Unlike iNOS, eNOS and nNOS produce NO in small amounts for normal physiological functions. 5 The enzyme iNOS catalyzes the production of NO from L-arginine, using oxygen (O 2 ) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) as co-factors. The reaction produces NO and L-citrulline as byproducts: L-Arginine + O 2 + NADPH + H + \u2192 L-Citrulline + NO + NADP + NO is synthesized through a five-electron oxidation process targeting the terminal guanidine group of L-arginine. This reaction, catalyzed by NOS, necessitates the presence of flavins and tetrahydrobiopterin as essential cofactors. Additionally, as already mentioned, NO production is dependent on O 2 and NADPH. Within the NOS enzyme, the reductase domain facilitates the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to the heme domain, where L-arginine undergoes oxidation through a two-step mechanism. Initially, NOS flavins accept an electron from NADPH and relay it to the heme iron, reducing NOSFe 3+ to NOSFe 2+ . In this phase, L-arginine undergoes hydroxylation, forming an enzyme-bound intermediate, N\u03c7-hydroxyl-L-arginine. Subsequently, the heme iron binds O 2 , enabling the enzyme to utilize NADPH in oxidizing N\u03c7-hydroxyl-L-arginine into citrulline and NO. 2 Once produced, iNOS-derived NO diffuses freely across cell membranes due to its small, gaseous nature. Within cells, NO exerts its effects primarily through interaction with soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which modulates various signaling pathways, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and immune responses. Additionally, NO can react with superoxide (O 2 \u2013 ) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2013 ), a reactive nitrogen species that contributes to oxidative and nitrosative stress, impacting cellular homeostasis. NO also influences mitochondrial function by inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in the electron transport chain, which can affect adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and trigger apoptosis under pathological conditions. 6 NO can be toxic to all cells and, at high concentrations, non-specifically reacts with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, accelerating inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Thus, iNOS-derived NO plays a dual role in cellular physiology, mediating both protective and detrimental effects depending on its concentration and cellular context. This ability of NO is described in detail in the below-coming sub-parts of the manuscript. The review aims to show the mechanisms by which plant-derived phenolic compounds regulate NO production in microglia and to explore their potential therapeutic applications. The present study focuses on understanding how plant phenolics modulate iNOS activity and NO levels in microglia, identifying potential pathways involved in their regulatory effects. By elucidating these mechanisms, the research seeks to determine whether specific phenolic compounds can serve as neuroprotective agents, mitigating neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. The findings may have significant implications for developing plant-based interventions for neurodegenerative disorders, where dysregulated NO production and chronic neuroinflammation are key pathological features. Data Retrieval To ensure the inclusion of high-quality, peer-reviewed research, searches were performed in reputable scientific databases: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. A systematic keyword search was designed using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms. The following search terms were used: \u201cNitric oxide\u201d OR \u201cNO signaling,\u201d \u201cNitric oxide synthase\u201d OR \u201cNOS isoforms\u201d OR \u201ciNOS\u201d OR \u201ceNOS\u201d OR \u201cnNOS,\u201d \u201cNO and inflammation\u201d OR \u201ciNOS and immune response,\u201d \u201cNO metabolism\u201d or \u201cNO biosynthesis,\u201d \u201cNitric oxide and oxidative stress\u201d OR \u201cPeroxynitrite formation,\u201d \u201cNO and mitochondrial function.\u201d Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) were applied to refine search results. The applied filters were: mainly publication date (last 10 years (2014\u20132024) for recent advancements), language (English only), document type (original research articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses), publication source (journals indexed in Scopus Q1/Q2 or Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar). Highly cited papers (\u2265 50 citations) were prioritized. Some preprints and conference abstracts were checked for emerging trends. Physiological and Pathological Roles of Nitric Oxide As previously mentioned, iNOS is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level and is not typically expressed in most human tissues. It is primarily expressed in macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells and its function is influenced by the regulation of arginine transport or its utilization in other biochemical pathways. The active iNOS enzyme functions as a homodimer, similar to the constitutive forms of this enzyme. 7 The induction of iNOS expression varies significantly due to the diversity of signal transduction pathways and transcription factors involved, exhibiting both cell-type and species specificity. 8 For example, in some rodent cells, iNOS expression is triggered by exposure to Gram-negative bacterial LPS and cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and other metabolites. 3 In addition, NO, depending on the cell type, along with protein kinase A, protein kinase C, p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway, and other specific kinases and phosphatases, plays a role (through various mechanisms) in both the activation and suppression of iNOS ( Figure 1 ). 9 Figure 1 Regulation of iNOS expression by inflammatory stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and oxidative stress induce the expression of iNOS. The resulting increase in iNOS expression leads to elevated NO production. NO levels can, in turn, regulate upstream signaling pathways, either through activation or suppression feedback loops. This regulatory network involves protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and MAPK/ERK signaling cascades, which contribute to the modulation of inflammatory responses in microglial cells. ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IFN-\u03b2: interferon-\u03b2; IL: interleukin; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NO: nitric oxide; TNF-\u03b1: tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) serves as a pivotal regulator of iNOS expression, responding to both activators and inhibitors. Various stimuli, including LPS, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and oxidative stress, have been shown to induce iNOS expression by activating NF-\u03baB. Moreover, the inhibition of iNOS expression by some agents such as glucocorticoids, transforming growth factors, antioxidants, and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitors is directly associated with the suppression of the activation of NF-\u03baB. 10 This inhibition can occur through several mechanisms, including direct sequestration of NF-\u03baB via protein\u2013protein interactions, suppression of its transactivation activity, prevention of its nuclear translocation, or increased expression of inhibitor of kappaB kinase (I\u03baB) isoforms, which serve as specific NF-\u03baB inhibitors. Upon stimulation by exogenous and endogenous factors, I\u03baB typically dissociates and undergoes degradation following phosphorylation, allowing the NF-\u03baB complex to translocate into the nucleus and bind to cis-regulatory regions of the iNOS promoter. This inhibition can result from direct capture of NF-\u03baB by protein\u2013protein interactions, inhibition of NF-\u03baB transactivation activity, inhibition of nuclear translocation, or from the enhancement of the expression of I\u03baB isoforms, which are the specific inhibitors of NF-\u03baB. Following the activation of cells by exogenous and endogenous agents, I\u03baB generally dissociates and degrades after phosphorylation, and the DNA-binding complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the iNOS promoter cis-regulatory regions. 11 Strong NF-\u03baB activators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 rapidly induce the degradation of I\u03baB isoforms, particularly the I\u03baB\u03b1. The phosphorylation provides specificity to this signaling pathway, with a critical regulatory phase involving the activation of the I\u03baB kinase. I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 interacts with MAPK kinase kinase and NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase, with MAPK kinase kinase activation, in its turn, occurring via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway. This activation subsequently triggers a cascade involving MAPKs, such as p42/p44 MAPK/ERK processes extensively studied for their role in regulating iNOS expression. 12 As mentioned earlier, the regulation of the iNOS is induced by three main factors: infections, influence of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3) and, eventually, oxidative stress. Once expressed, iNOS produces large and sustained amounts of NO, which can act as both a defense mechanism as well as a potential actor in tissue damage. 2 The NO has been shown to possess antiviral, antiparasital, immunomodulatory, antitumoral, anticancer and microbicidal properties as mentioned earlier. Macrophages and other immune cells use NO against vast types of infections. 13 14 However, the overexpression of iNOS gene can have negative effects and appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of human metabolic deviations. The main mechanisms that control iNOS at the expression level are transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. 2 3 With some cytokines, bacterial LPS, and other metabolites are able to stimulate iNOS production in a variety of cell types, including microglia: the distinct cells or species may have distinct pathways that lead to the stimulation of iNOS expression. In most cells, iNOS induction appears to need the activation of the transcription factors (NF-\u03baB and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1\u03b1), which in turn activates the iNOS promoter. However, the post-transcriptional mechanisms also play a crucial role in controlling the production and activation of iNOS. In addition, the phosphorylation, palmitoylation, nitrosylation, myristoylation, and changes in subcellular localization are some of the post-translational metabolic processes that control nNOS and eNOS activity. Numerous immunomodulators are able to prevent the induction of iNOS. 7 13 15 For iNOS expression control various agents can be considered, among which the plant-origin phenolic substances are able to play a role due to their strong reducing ability. Polyphenols as Modulators of Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Activity and Inflammatory Processes Different exogenous stimuli are able to control the production and activity of iNOS. Polyphenols, the group of plant secondary metabolites, are among the exogenous factors altering the expression or activity of the iNOS. This group of substances express a high biological activity and play a significant role in regulating cellular metabolism. 2 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 This ability is indirectly indicating the possible role of these plant secondary metabolites in the regulation of iNOS. Research on how various phenolic substances affect the generation of NO has grown significantly during the past years. However, it is wandering to understand how the phenolic substances, the products of plant secondary metabolism, influence NO generation and iNOS activity in immune cells of mammals in case of the constant issue of bioavailability of these metabolites as well as the complicated metabolic pathways in organisms. Anyway, it could be wondering to turn to the traditional/folk medicine, to rise ancient manuscripts and analyze the information embedded in a literature 20 concerning the influence of natural metabolites on the resistance to different diseases. This could bring to the realization the main sources of the biologically active metabolites, predict their influence and acting targets in the human immune system. In our previous articles, 3 23 24 we analyzed some recent literature and in combination with our own research data concluded that plant-origin phenolic substances are able to mitigate the oxidative stress in some cells and even organisms and regulate their metabolism. Moreover, these metabolites not only quench free radicals but also are able to regulate the expression of some genes responsible for the synthesis of the main antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase) as well as of some inflammatory markers such as ILs, and iNOS. We showed that these substances influence the cells by the multidirectional mechanisms by regulating the activity of multiple enzymes, gene expression, neutralizing the reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and contributing gene silencing (epigenetic regulation). We concluded that plant-origin phenolic substances are also able to influence on cell membranes by changing the proton/potassium fluxes, ATPase activity, and influencing some membrane transporters such as ATP synthase-binding cassette transport proteins. 2 19 20 25 26 27 Plant phenolic compounds can indirectly regulate NO production by modulating cellular metabolism and improving mitochondrial function. These metabolites inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling regulating iNOS expression. By promoting a metabolic shift from glycolysis toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, phenolics reduce the pro-inflammatory metabolic profile of activated microglia. This shift is supported by enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency, often through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-\u03b1 and Sirtuin 1 \u2014 two key regulators of cellular metabolism, mitochondrial function, and aging. This improves ATP production and redox balance while suppressing ROS and downstream inflammatory responses. Consequently, this metabolic reprogramming leads to lower iNOS expression and decreased NO production, contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds as well as the maintenance of redox homeostasis in cells. Some literature suggests that the application of resveratrol is able to lead to a decrease in the expressions of iNOS and the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit, as well as a reduction in the release of proinflammatory factors. However, when either Sirtuin 1 or suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (a critical negative regulator of cytokine signaling and immune responses) were silenced using small interfering RNA, these resveratrol-induced effects were significantly diminished. 28 29 Microglia play a crucial role in maintaining CNS homeostasis as they are the resident immune cells of the CNS, responsible for immune surveillance, neuroprotection, and inflammatory responses throughout both brain development and maturity. During brain development, they contribute to neurogenesis, programmed cell death, synapse elimination, and the formation of neural circuits. 24 30 By creating new synapses, microglia help to maintain the integrity of neural circuits in postnatal life. Following a CNS injury, microglia undergo morphological changes and downregulate genes involved in homeostatic processes. It is stated that controlling microglia activity during disease pathology may be a tactic used to create new treatments meant to prevent brain degeneration in conditions like multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other deviations connected with the inflammation processes in nervous system. 31 In this review, we will discuss the possible known mechanisms of the regulation of NO production in microglia under the influence of some polyphenols. Plant-Derived Phenolic Compounds as Regulators of Nitric Oxide Production in Microglia NO plays a dual role in microglia as it was mentioned earlier. They act as both neuroprotective and neurotoxic molecules, depending on their concentration and the context of activation. 32 Microglia, as many other NO producing cells, express iNOS in response to inflammatory stimuli such as pathogens (bacteria, viruses), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), damage-associated molecular patterns from injured neurons and oxidative stress. 33 Peripheral macrophages support the self-maintaining and self-renewing microglia population only during pathology. 34 Early research typically assumed that microglia were branching with several thin protrusions and in a resting state under physiologically normal circumstances. However, according to new research, the branched microglia never truly stop patrolling the brain. They use their motor branch as a \u201csentinel\u201d to look into and check their immediate surroundings in order to identify any abnormalities in the homeostasis of the brain. When a problem is detected, microglia quickly transform into large, amoeba-like cells and migrate toward the site of injury or infection. They then engulf pathogens, dead cells, and debris through phagocytosis, release inflammatory signals, and help coordinate the immune response in the CNS. 35 In addition to producing a variety of signaling molecules\u2014such as cytokines, neurotransmitters, and extracellular matrix proteins\u2014to regulate neuronal and synaptic activity and their functional plasticity, activated microglia may also become significant producers of ROS when they participate in the phagosomal breakdown of internalized targets. Toxic molecules, including ROS, will be released from the microglia if these internalization targets are excessively large and improperly processed inside the phagosome. 33 36 As the primary immune effector cells of the CNS, microglia remain active, continuously monitoring the brain microenvironment by extending and retracting their branches. They regulate neural circuits through specific interactions with neuronal synapses, contribute to synaptic pruning, and efficiently remove apoptotic cells to preserve CNS homeostasis. Moreover, microglia play a crucial role in most known CNS diseases. 33 In activated microglial cells, iNOS produces large amounts of NO, which plays critical roles in neuroimmune interactions: it has neuroprotective activity, and participate in neurotransmission modulation by regulating neuronal communication, synaptic plasticity and \u201clearning\u201d processes. NO expresses also antioxidant and vasodilator effects: at physiological levels, it helps to maintain cerebral blood flow and protects neurons from mild oxidative stress. It has also expressed antimicrobial properties against a vast number of pathogens, as already mentioned. 33 37 However, chronic microglial activation leads to excessive NO production, contributing to nitrosative and oxidative stresses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal death. These can lead to the triggering the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. NO reacts with glutamate pathways, leading to excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, increasing intracellular calcium, and promoting neuronal damage. 38 Regulating NO levels in microglia is crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis and preventing neurodegeneration. There are several factors influencing iNOS activity and NO production levels such as some medicinal preparations reducing the NO production in neuroinflammatory conditions, 39 and several antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine, vitamin E, flavonoids and other metabolites) neutralizing NO-induced oxidative stress. 2 40 Plant-derived phenolic compounds have also been shown to reduce NO release in microglial cells, primarily by inhibiting iNOS expression and modulating inflammatory pathways. These compounds exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects in microglia. 2 41 Mechanisms of Phenolic Compounds on Modulating Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase in Microglia Many phenolic compounds directly suppress iNOS expression, reducing excessive NO production. For instance, it is stated that andrographolide, a bioactive compound present in the leaves of Andrographis paniculata , inhibits NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated by endotoxins, LPS and IFN-\u03b3 by the influence on iNOS mRNA, and enzyme activity. 42 In our recent investigations, we reported the influence of plant phenolic metabolites on iNOS mRNA in BV2 microglial cell lines, both wild type and the acetyl-coenzyme A type 1 deficient mutant. 3 The cells were stimulated by bacterial LPS. In this case, in addition to the inhibition of iNOS mRNA we observed also the reduction of NO synthesis under the influence of the phenolic fraction of Ribes nigrum leaf extract. 3 The similar effect of plant phenolic compounds on the iNOS expression has been shown also by many other authors. 7 43 44 There are also other mechanisms of influence of plant-origin phenolic metabolites on the NO producing levels in microglial cells. One of the mechanisms is suppressing the NF-\u03baB pathway, which is a key regulator of inflammation in microglia and preventing iNOS induction. In general, NF-\u03baB activation by ROS promotes gene expression and supports cell survival, while its activation rarely results in necrosis. Increased ROS levels also trigger the activation of MAPK pathways and pro-inflammatory gene expression. 43 44 Phenolic compounds are able to modulate the MAPKs (including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), ERK, and p38) which regulate inflammatory responses in organisms. 45 46 These metabolites downregulate the mentioned pathways, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and NO production. In addition, phenolic compounds are able to reduce oxidative stress by the neutralization of free radicals (ROS, and RNS) that promote NO overproduction and peroxynitrite formation ( Figure 2 ). 2 Figure 2 Effects of phenolic compounds on key immunomodulating pathways in microglia. iNOS: Inducible nitric oxide synthase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-\u03baB: nuclear factor-\u03baB; NRF2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; PI3K/Akt: phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B. Some phenolic substances activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor that enhances antioxidant defenses, reducing NO-induced oxidative stress. Phenolic compounds enhance the NRF2 antioxidant signaling pathway via its electrophilic center, which serves as a target for nucleophiles such as the sulfhydryl group on KEAP1. This interaction activates NRF2, which, in turn, regulates the expression of key antioxidants by binding to specific sites within the human antioxidant response element promoter region. This includes critical rate-limiting enzymes like glutamylcysteine synthetase and acetyl-coenzyme A type 1, which protect cells from oxidative damage ( Figure 3 ). 14 Figure 3 The main pathways suppressing the NO synthesis in microglia under the influence of natural phenolic compounds. Plant-derived phenolic compounds modulate multiple signaling pathways involved in neuroinflammation. These compounds mitigate oxidative stress and suppress the NF-\u03baB pathway, resulting in the inhibition of iNOS expression and activity. Additionally, phenolics regulate the JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways, modulate MAPKs including JNK, ERK, p38, and p53, and activate NRF2/ERK1/2/NOX2 signaling. Through these mechanisms, they influence the levels of ANGII and collectively lead to the suppression of NO synthesis in activated microglial cells, expressing anti-inflammatory and protective effects. ANGII: Angiotensin II; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; JAK: Janus kinase; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-\u03baB: nuclear factor-\u03baB; NO: nitric oxide; NOX2: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2; NRF2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; PI3K/Akt: phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription. It is documented that resveratrol, the best-known plant-derived stilbenoid phenolic, affects the ERK1/2-ribosomal S6 kinase 1-nNOS signaling pathway, expressing its antioxidant property. Some of the plant-based phenolic compounds are able to mitigate the angiotensin II levels by activating the NRF2/ERK1/2/NADPH oxidase 2 pathway, while ANGII itself can alleviate AngII-induced oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity through ERK1/2 activation and NRF2 nuclear translocation ( Figure 3 ). 47 Phenolic compounds such as resveratrol, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, and baicalein exhibit potent inhibitory effects on NO synthesis in microglia by targeting iNOS expression in microglia. There could be also other mechanisms at play ( Table 1 ). The actions of phenolic metabolites are mediated through suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulating ROS production, and enhancing antioxidant defense mechanisms.

Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound from Curcuma longa, suppresses iNOS expression by interfering with NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways while also promoting NRF2 activation in microglia, enhancing cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. 2 48 Table 1 gathers the information on the iNOS inhibition of plant origin phenolic substances. 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 The presented phenolic compounds act on different stages of iNOS regulation and NO synthesis, contributing to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Their ability to modulate NO production is especially relevant in conditions such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disorders. Flavonoids, such as quercetin and epigallocatechin gallate, further contribute to NO regulation by modulating the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways. These compounds effectively attenuate microglial activation, thereby reducing NO-induced neuronal damage. Additionally, lignans such as magnolol and honokiol from Magnolia officinalis inhibit NO production by suppressing Toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammatory cascades. 63 64 65 Beyond their direct effects on microglial NO production, phenolic compounds also modulate immune homeostasis by balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling. Their ability to restore mitochondrial function, enhance glutathione synthesis, and regulate autophagy pathways further underscores their therapeutic potential in neuroinflammation. These substances express also strong antioxidant properties. Moreover, dietary intake and bioavailability of these compounds significantly influence their efficacy in the CNS, necessitating further research into nanoparticle-based delivery systems to enhance their therapeutic impact. Overall, plant-derived phenolic compounds represent promising candidates for modulating microglial activation and NO production, offering potential therapeutic avenues for treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying their neuroprotective effects will facilitate the development of novel plant-derived interventions for CNS pathologies. Conclusion and Future Directions Plant-derived phenolic compounds have demonstrated significant potential in regulating NO production in microglia and mitigating neuroinflammatory responses associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Through the modulation of key signaling pathways such as NF-\u03baB, MAPKs, NRF2, and PI3K/Akt, these bioactive compounds inhibit iNOS expression, suppress oxidative stress, and promote neuroprotection. Additionally, their ability to restore immune homeostasis, regulate mitochondrial function, and modulate autophagy further supports their therapeutic role in CNS pathologies. Despite promising laboratory data and preclinical evidence, several challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical applications. One of the key challenges is the bioavailability and metabolic stability of plant phenolics. Many phenolic compounds, including curcumin and resveratrol, exhibit poor water solubility, rapid metabolism, and low systemic absorption, limiting their therapeutic efficacy. However, the positive effects of these metabolites on the immune system and CNS have been time-tested, reflecting their effective centuries-old use in traditional medicine. Future research should focus on the development of advanced delivery systems, such as nanoformulations, liposomal encapsulation, and polymeric nanoparticles, to enhance their bioavailability and CNS penetration. Another crucial area for future investigation is the potential synergistic effects of plant-derived phenolic substances when used in combination with existing anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective agents. Phenolic substances can potentiate the effects of synthetic drugs by targeting complementary or overlapping pathways, leading to enhanced inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppression of NO and ROS production. For instance, resveratrol has been shown to enhance the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids in suppressing neuroinflammation, potentially allowing for dose reduction and minimizing side effects. 66 However, this synergy also demands comprehensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies to assess drug interactions, bioavailability modulation, and systemic effects. Understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these compounds in combination therapies could lead to more effective treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, further studies are needed to elucidate the long-term safety and potential side effects of chronic administration of phenolic metabolites, particularly concerning immune modulation and systemic homeostasis. Although phenolic compounds are generally considered safe and are abundant in the human diet, long-term administration at therapeutic doses raises important concerns such as immune suppression or overstimulation, hormonal interference, especially in compounds with phytoestrogenic activity (e.g., genistein), 24 67 68 hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity in high-dose or prolonged use scenarios. Among the potential side effects of combining phenolic compounds with pharmaceutical agents introduces the possibility of pharmacokinetic interference (e.g., modulation of cytochromes P450 enzymes), 69 increased bleeding risk when used with anticoagulants (noted with flavonoids, and curcumin), 70 71 reduced efficacy or toxicity through competition for metabolic pathways. 72 Another characteristic of phenolic compounds is their pleiotropic or multi-targeted nature. Unlike single-target drugs, phenolics often modulate multiple cellular pathways, including antioxidant defenses (NRF2 activation), inflammatory signaling (NF-\u03baB inhibition), mitochondrial integrity (enhanced biogenesis and membrane stabilization), epigenetic regulation, and microglial polarization. Moreover, future research should explore the role of these substances in modulating the gut-brain axis, as emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota composition influences neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Investigating the interplay between dietary phenolics, gut microbiota, and neuroimmune responses could provide novel insights into their mechanisms of action and broaden their therapeutic applications. These broad-spectrum actions suggest that phenolic compounds may not only reduce neuroinflammation but also contribute to cognitive resilience, synaptic plasticity, and overall neural network stability. Incorporating phenolic substances into dietary interventions and functional foods presents another exciting avenue for preventing and managing neurodegenerative conditions. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of phenolic-enriched diets in reducing neuroinflammatory markers, such as NO, and improving cognitive function are warranted to validate their therapeutic potential in human populations. Overall, while plant-derived phenolic compounds hold immense promise in regulating NO production and alleviating microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, further research is needed to optimize their delivery, understand their mechanistic interactions, and establish their clinical relevance. Addressing these challenges will pave the way for the development of novel, plant-based therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

    "full_text_abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases with microglial activation and excessive nitric oxide production contributing significantly to disease progression. Plant-derived phenolic compounds have emerged as promising neuroprotective agents due to their ability to modulate the key signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B. These bioactive molecules effectively suppress inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, reduce oxidative and nitrosative stress, and restore immune homeostasis. Additionally, these natural phenolic compounds are able to regulate mitochondrial function and autophagy, further supporting their therapeutic potential in central nervous system disorders. The presented review aimed to explain the key known mechanisms of action of plant-origin phenolics, in order to evaluate their potential in developing treatments and preventing central nervous system diseases."
