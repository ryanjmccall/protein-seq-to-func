    "abstract_text": "Two distinct c-mil-related cDNA clones have been isolated from a chicken embryo cDNA library. Results presented here show that the single chicken c-mil gene is coding for two c-mil mRNA species, different by at least 60 base pairs and generated by an alternative splicing mechanism. These mRNA molecules can be translated into two distinct proteins of 73 and 71 kilodaltons.",
