  "abstract_text": "Mono-glucosylation of (H/K/N)Ras by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) blocks critical survival signaling pathways, resulting in apoptotic cell death. One yet unsolved problem in studies on TcsL is the lack of a method allowing the specific detection of (H/K/N)Ras glucosylation. In this study, we identify the Ras(Mab 27H5) antibody as a glucosylation-sensitive antibody capable for the immunoblot detection of (H/K/N)Ras glucosylation in TcsL-treated cells. Alternative Ras antibodies including the K-Ras(Mab F234) antibody or the v-H-Ras(Mab Y13-159) antibody recognize Ras proteins regardless of glucosylation. (H/K)Ras are further shown to be more efficaciously glucosylated by TcsL than Rac1 in rat basophilic leukemia cells as well as in a cell-free system.",
