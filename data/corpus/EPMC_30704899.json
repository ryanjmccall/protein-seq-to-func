    "abstract_text": "mTORC1 and GSK3 play critical roles in early stages of (macro)autophagy, but how they regulate late steps of autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we show that mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 signaling converge to modulate autophagosome maturation through Pacer, an autophagy regulator that was identified in our recent study. Hepatocyte-specific Pacer knockout in mice results in impaired autophagy flux, glycogen and lipid accumulation, and liver fibrosis. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates Pacer at serine157 to disrupt the association of Pacer with Stx17 and the HOPS complex and thus abolishes Pacer-mediated autophagosome maturation. Importantly, dephosphorylation of Pacer under nutrient-deprived conditions promotes TIP60-mediated Pacer acetylation, which facilitates HOPS complex recruitment and is required for autophagosome maturation and lipid droplet clearance. This work not only identifies Pacer as a regulator in hepatic autophagy and liver homeostasis in\u00a0vivo but also reveals a signal integration mechanism involved in late stages of autophagy and lipid metabolism.",
