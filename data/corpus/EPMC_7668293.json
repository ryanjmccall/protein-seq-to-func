  "abstract_text": "A YAC contig was constructed of Xq13.1 in order to sublocalize the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) syndrome locus, DYT3. The contig spans a region of approximately 1.8 Mb and includes loci DXS453/DXS348/IL2R gamma/GJB1/CCG1/DXS559. For the construction of the contig, nine sequence-tagged sites and four short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) were isolated. The STRPs, designated as 4704#6 (DXS7113), 4704#7 (DXS7114), 67601 (DXS7117), and B4Pst (DXS7119) were assigned to a region flanked by DXS348 proximally and by DXS559 distally. Their order was DXS348/4704 #6/4704 #7/67601/B4Pst/DXS559. They were applied to the analysis of allelic association and of haplotypes in 47 not-obviously-related XDP patients and in 105 Filipino male controls. The same haplotype was found at loci 67601 (DXS7117) and B4Pst (DXS7119) in 42 of 47 patients. This percentage of common haplotypes decreased at the adjacent loci. The findings, together with the previous demonstration of DXS559 being the distal flanking marker of DYT3, assign the disease locus to a small region in Xq13.1 defined by loci 67601 (DXS7117) and B4Pst (DXS7119). The location of DYT3 was born out by the application of a newly developed likelihood method for the analysis of linkage disequilibrium.",
