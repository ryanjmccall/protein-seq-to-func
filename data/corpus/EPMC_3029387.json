  "abstract_text": "The solution structures of two human growth hormone releasing factor analogues, 27Leu45Gly-hGHRF(1-45)OH and 27Nle-hGHRF(1-29)NH2, are investigated by means of circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, it is shown that both peptides adopt ordered structures at low concentrations of trifluoroethanol (approximately 30%). Quantitative analysis of the circular dichroism spectra indicates that the same number of residues, approximately 23 to 25, are in a helical state in both peptides. Using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods all proton resonances of the 27Nle-hGHRF(1-29)NH2 fragment are assigned and its secondary structure is determined from a qualitative interpretation of the nuclear Overhauser enhancement data. Two distinctive regions of alpha-helix are present extending from residues 6 to 13 and 16 to 29.",
