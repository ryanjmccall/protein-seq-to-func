    "abstract_text": "PML is a component of a multiprotein complex, termed nuclear bodies, and the PML protein was originally discovered in patients suffering from acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). APL is associated with a reciprocal chromosomal translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17, which results in a fusion protein comprising PML and the retinoic acid receptor alpha. The PML genomic locus is approximately 35 kb and is subdivided into nine exons. A large number of alternative spliced transcripts are synthesized from the PML gene, resulting in a variety of PML proteins ranging in molecular weight from 48-97 kDa. In this review we summarize the data on the known PML isoforms and splice variants and present a new unifying nomenclature. Although, the function/s of the PML variants are unclear, all PML isoforms contain an identical N-terminal region, suggesting that these sequences are indispensable for function, but differ in their C-terminal sequences. The N-terminal region harbours a RING-finger, two B-boxes and a predicted alpha-helical Coiled-Coil domain, that together form the RBCC/TRIM motif found in a large family of proteins. In PML this motif is essential for PML nuclear body formation in vivo and PML-homo and hetero interactions conferring growth suppressor, apoptotic and anti-viral activities. In APL oligomerization mediated by the RBCC/TRIM motif is essential for the transformation potential of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein.",
