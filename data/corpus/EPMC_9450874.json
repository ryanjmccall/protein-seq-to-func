    "abstract_text": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, telangiectasia, sinopulmonary infections, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, and combined immunodeficiency. Recently, the AT gene (ATM) was cloned and shown to be mutated in AT patients. In this report, mutation analysis of ATM was performed in a 24-year-old AT patient without immunodeficiency. ATM amplified with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was screened with a ribonuclease (RNase) cleavage assay and auto-sequenced. This patient, a compound heterozygote, showed two mutations in ATM: one missense mutation leading to a Leu2656Pro substitution and the other to the truncation at codon 3047 (Arg-->ter). The latter mutation is within the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-like domain and the former is outside but close to the domain. The particular phenotype in our patient, no immunodeficiency, suggests incomplete functional loss of ATM protein. The clinical spectrum of AT caused by ATM mutations may be broader than previously thought. Further analysis of patients with similar phenotypes will make the relation between ATM genotype and phenotype clear.",
