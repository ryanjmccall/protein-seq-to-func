  "abstract_text": "We cloned the human xeroderma pigmentosum group A gene (XPA) and characterized the XPA promoter (pXPA) by transient cat expression. The pXPA is extraordinarily weak in human fibroblasts (1% of RSV-LTR) and appears to function without any of the usual promoter elements. Regions containing positive and negative control elements were localized.",
