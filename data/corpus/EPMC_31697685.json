A\u2013B) Qualitative detection of the steady-state levels of intracellular ROS by fluorescence microscopy. Wild-type (WT), KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 (KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 ) and KRIT1-transduced (Lv-KRIT1 9/6) MEFs grown under standard conditions were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy 20 min after the addition of the cell-permeable redox-sensitive fluorogenic probe DCFH-DA (A) or DHE (B). The images were taken with a fixed short exposure time and a high fluorescence intensity threshold value to avoid saturation, and are representative of several independent experiments. Notice that KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 cells (panels b) showed significantly more intense fluorescent signals than WT cells (panels a), indicating that they contained higher levels of ROS. Conversely, ROS levels in KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 cells were reduced to near WT levels upon KRIT1 re-expression by lentiviral infection (panels c). Scale bar represents 50 \u03bcm. C\u2013H. Quantitative determination of the steady-state levels of intracellular ROS by FACS analysis. Wild-type (WT), KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 (K \u2212/\u2212 ) and three distinct KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 cell populations re-expressing KRIT1 at low, medium and high levels, respectively [Lv-KRIT1 2/7 (K2/7), 10/6 (K10/6) and 9/6 (K9/6)], were grown under standard conditions and analyzed by FACS 20 min after the addition of the DCFH-DA (C\u2013F) or DHE (G,H) probes. Representative flow cytometry profiles (C,E,G) and quantitative histograms of the mean fluorescence intensity (M.F.I.) values (D,F,H) of n\u22655 independent FACS experiments are shown. M.F.I. values were normalized to spontaneous fluorescence of control cells untreated with the fluorogenic probes (Ctr) and expressed as percentage of KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 (K \u2212/\u2212 ) cells (\u00b1 SD). *P<0.001 versus KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. Notice that KRIT1 \u2212/\u2212 cells displayed the highest content of intracellular ROS, whereas the re-expression of KRIT1 caused a significant, expression level-dependent decrease in intracellular ROS levels.
