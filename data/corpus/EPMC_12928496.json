  "abstract_text": "X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is an X-linked recessive adult onset movement disorder characterized by both dystonia and parkinsonism. We report delineation of the disease gene within a 300-kb interval of Xq13.1 by allelic association. Sequencing of this region in a patient revealed five disease-specific single-nucleotide changes (here referred to as DSC) and a 48-bp deletion unique to XDP. One of the DSCs is located within an exon of a not previously described multiple transcript system that is composed of at least 16 exons. There is a minimum of three different transcription start sites that encode four different transcripts. Two of these transcripts include distal portions of the TAF1 gene (TATA-box binding protein-associated factor 1) and are alternatively spliced. Three exons overlap with ING2 (a putative tumor suppressor) and with a homologue of CIS4 (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein 4), both of which are encoded by the opposite strand. Although all DSCs are located within this multiple transcript system, only DSC3 lies within an exon. This exon is used by all alternative transcripts making a pathogenic role of DSC3 in XDP likely. The multiple transcript system is therefore referred to as DYT3 (disease locus in XDP).",
