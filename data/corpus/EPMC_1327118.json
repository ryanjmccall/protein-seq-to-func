  "abstract_text": "The sequence-specific 1H NMR assignments of the 89-residue recombinant kringle domain from human urokinase are presented. These were achieved primarily by utilizing TOCSY and NOESY spectra in conjunction with COSY spectra recorded at 500 MHz and 600 MHz. Regular secondary structure elements have been derived from a qualitative interpretation of nuclear Overhauser enhancement, JNH alpha coupling constant, and amide proton exchange data. Two helices have been identified. One helix, involving Ser40-Gly46, corresponds to that reported for t-PA kringle 2 (Byeon et al., 1991), but does not exist in other kringles with known structures. The second helix, in the region Asn26-Gln33, is thus far unique to the urokinase kringle. Three antiparallel beta-sheets and three tight turns have also been identified, which correspond exactly to those identified in t-PA kringle 2 both in solution and in the crystalline state (de Vos et al., 1992). Despite the very different ligand binding properties of the urokinase kringle, NOE data indicate that the tertiary fold of the molecule conforms closely to that found for other kringles.",
