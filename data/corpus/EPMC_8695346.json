    "abstract_text": "The characteristic tumours of MEN 2 are medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and phaeochromocytoma. Somatic RET mutations have been found in only 23-40% of sporadic MTC and 10% of sporadic phaeochromocytomas. Thus, we sought other genes which may play a role in the pathogenesis of these tumours. We carried out direct sequence analysis of human c-mos and human ENRB in a series of sporadic MTC and phaeochromocytomas to determine if somatic mutations in these two genes could account for some of the sporadic MEN 2-related tumours in which no RET mutations are detected. No somatic mutations were found.",
