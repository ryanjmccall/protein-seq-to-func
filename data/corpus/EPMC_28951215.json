    "abstract_text": "UHRF2 (Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays important roles in DNA methylation, histone modifications and cell cycle regulation by interacting with multiple epigenetic or cell-cycle related proteins. Previous studied have identified PCNA (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen) as an interacting partner of UHRF2 by using the antibody microarray. However, the molecular mechanism and the function of UHRF2-PCNA interaction remains unclear. Here, we report the complex structure of PCNA and the peptide (<sup>784</sup>NEILQTLLDLFFPGYSK<sup>800</sup>) derived from UHRF2 that contains a PIP box. Structural analysis combined with mutagenesis experiments provide the molecular basis for the recognition of UHRF2 by PCNA via PIP-box.",
