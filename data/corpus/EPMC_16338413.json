    "abstract_text": "The human ERCC1/XPF complex is a structure-specific endonuclease with defined polarity that participates in multiple DNA repair pathways. We report the heterodimeric structure of the C-terminal domains of both proteins responsible for ERCC1/XPF complex formation. Both domains exhibit the double helix-hairpin-helix motif (HhH)2, and they are related by a pseudo-2-fold symmetry axis. In the XPF domain, the hairpin of the second motif is replaced by a short turn. The ERCC1 domain folds properly only in the presence of the XPF domain, which implies a role for XPF as a scaffold for the folding of ERCC1. The intersubunit interactions are largely hydrophobic in nature. NMR titration data show that only the ERCC1 domain of the ERCC1/XPF complex is involved in DNA binding. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model for the targeting of XPF nuclease via ERCC1-mediated interactions in the context of nucleotide excision repair.",
