    "abstract_text": "Interactions of the trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors with neurotrophins result in growth and maturational changes in neuronal cells. The continued progression, maturation, or regression of neuroblastoma, an embryonal, sympathetic nervous system-derived tumor of infants and children, might be governed by neurotrophic influences. Immunocytochemistry was utilized to evaluate TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC protein expression at the cellular level in the developing human fetal sympathetic nervous system and in a selection of neuroblastoma tumor specimens. TrkA and TrkC expression was identified in sympathetic ganglia and within the adrenal medulla, with intense TrkB expression restricted to paraganglia, of the normal developing human sympathetic nervous system. In neuroblastoma, pp140trkA expression correlated positively with favorable tumor stage (P = 0.0027) and favorable outcome (P = 0.026). No statistically significant correlation of TrkC expression with outcome was evident; however, both TrkA and TrkC expression was most apparent in tumor cells of increased differentiation. TrkB expression was primarily localized to cells within the fibrovascular tumor stroma. A model of neurotrophin receptor expression and neurotrophin reactivity with differentiation is proposed. The existence and spatial distribution of neurotrophin receptors in neuroblastoma lend supportive evidence that neurotrophic influences may be involved in tumor persistence or regression.",
