PHS is a global problem in agricultural production that causes losses in crop yield and quality [ 5 \u2013 7 ]. In China, about 83% of the total wheat area is affected by PHS [ 8 ]. With climate change and more frequent extreme weather events, PHS is also becoming increasingly frequent during harvest. In 2023, the southern wheat regions of Huanghuai (e.g., Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui) experienced 5\u20136 days of continuous rainfall before harvest, causing serious PHS damage. Because wheat varieties with stronger seed dormancy generally have higher PHS resistance [ 9 \u2013 11 ], breeding them would mitigate PHS damage, especially in regions with frequent rainfall during harvest. Seed dormancy and PHS resistance are collectively regulated by multiple genes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods have revealed numerous loci for seed dormancy and PHS resistance on all wheat chromosomes [ 12 \u2013 16 ]. Because of the complexity of the wheat genome, few genes have been cloned using homologous and map-based cloning methods [ TaVp-1 genes, homologs of maize Viviparous-1 ( Vp-1 ) and Arabidopsis ABI3 ( ABA insensitive-3 ) [ 17 \u2013 20 ]; TaSdr-A1 and TaSdr-B1 , orthologs of rice seed dormancy 4 ( Sdr4 ) [ 21 , 22 ]; TaMFT ( TaPHS1 ), a homolog of Arabidopsis MOTHER OF FLOWERING TIME ( MFT ) [ 23 , 24 ]; TaMKK3-A , a barley mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 ( MKK3 ) homolog [ 25 ]; TaQsd1 , wheat homologs of barley Qsd1 encoding an alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) [ 26 , 27 ]; MYB10-D1 ( PHS-3D ), encoding an R2R3-MYB transcription factor Myb10 [ 7 ]; TaPI4K-2A , encoding a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) family protein [ 28 ]; and TaMYB7-A1 , encoding an R2R3 MYB-family transcription factor [ 29 ]]. In addition, TaJAZ1 [ 30 ], TaSRO1 [ 31 ], and TaGATA1 [ 32 ], have been isolated from wheat by other methods. These genes are potentially valuable for improving PHS resistance of wheat varieties. However, the complex genetic basis of wheat PHS resistance is largely not fully understood. Cloning additional genes that control seed dormancy will contribute to breeding varieties with high PHS resistance through the gene-pyramiding approach. In a previous study [ 9 ], identified a causal gene, Seed Dormancy 6 ( SD6 ), underlying a major QTL for seed dormancy in a strong-dormancy rice cultivar (Kasalath). This gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, also known as OsbHLH108. Six SNPs were found in the intron and coding regions of SD6 between Kasalath and Nipponbare parents. Under field conditions, SD6 significantly improved seed dormancy levels of elite rice varieties, and had no adverse effects on other important agronomic traits, making it a powerful breeding target for improving PHS resistance in rice. However, in common wheat, sequence variations of wheat homologous genes of SD6 , their roles in seed dormancy, and their frequency distributions are unknown. In this study, we aimed to: (i) clone wheat homologous genes of SD6 and analyze their sequence variations; (ii) develop molecular markers and validate their associations with seed dormancy; (iii) investigate frequency distributions of strong- and weak-dormancy alleles of TaSD6 ; and (iv) evaluate pyramiding effects of TaSD6 with known dormancy-related genes on seed dormancy. Our results provide useful gene resources and molecular markers for breeding wheat varieties with high PHS resistance. Materials and methods Plant materials Two wheat cultivars, Zhongyou 9507 (ZY9507, weak-dormancy and PHS-susceptible) with germination index (GI) of 0.84, and Suiningtuotuo (SNTT, strong dormancy and PHS-resistant) with GI of 0.07, were selected to clone wheat homologous genes of SD6 ( TaSD6-7A , TaSD6-7B , and TaSD6-7D ). A total of 160 wheat varieties with different dormancy levels were used to validate association of TaSD6 with seed dormancy (Table S2 ). These wheat varieties were planted at experimental stations in HF (Hefei, Anhui, 117\u00b0213\u2032E, 31\u00b0919\u2032N), HB (Huaibei, Anhui, 116\u00b0757\u2032E, 33\u00b0760\u2032N), SZ (Suzhou, Anhui, 117\u00b0253\u2032E, 33\u00b0676\u2032N), GH (Guohe, Anhui, 117\u00b020\u2032E, 31\u00b040\u2032N) and LK (Longkang, Anhui, 117\u00b005\u2032E, 33\u00b010\u2032N) during the 2021\u20132022 and 2022\u20132023 cropping seasons. They were harvested when grains reached physiological maturity (Table S10 ). In this study, the same block design was used in different regions, and the sowing density and field management measures were consistent. The germination test was carried out 5 days after harvest to control effects of environmental differences on phenotypes. The weak-dormancy and PHS-susceptible wheat variety Jing 411 (J411, GI = 0.89) carries the weak-dormancy allele of TaSD6-7A ( TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C ). Ethyl Methane sulphonate (EMS) mutants of TaSD6-7A ( tasd6-7a , 7A_85270376_E), TaSD6-7B ( tasd6-7b , 7B_27904500_E), and TaSD6-7D ( tasd6-7d , 7D_79898440_E) in the J411 background were used to validate their roles in seed dormancy. To minimize interference from genetic background mutation, tasd6-7a , tasd6-7b , and tasd6-7d were backcrossed with J411 three times, followed by self-crossing to obtain BC 3 F 2 progeny. Wheat EMS mutants were planted at the Dayangdian Experimental Station, Hefei, China (31\u00b058\u2032N, 117\u00b0240\u2032E). EMS mutants were provided by Boready Biotechnology Ltd. ( http://www.molbreeding.com ). Transgenic rice lines and wild-type Nipponbare were grown in well-managed greenhouses (10 h light (28 \u00b0C)/14 h dark (25 \u00b0C); 70% relative humidity; light intensity 200 \u00b5mol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ). Transgenic Arabidopsis seeds were grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing hygromycin, and transplanted at the 4-leaf stage into square pots filled with nutrient soil and vermiculite (1:3), then grown in a greenhouse (16 h light/8 h dark). Subsequently, homozygous lines were selected for further study. Seed dormancy and PHS resistance assays Wheat seeds were harvested at physiological maturity, dried at room temperature, and then tested for germination percentage (GP) and GI at a seed moisture content of ~ 12% [ 7 ]. Approximately 40\u201350 healthy seeds were placed evenly in a circular Petri dish padded with two layers of filter paper and ~ 8 mL of distilled water, and incubated at 20 \u00b0C with a 14/10 h light/dark cycle. Germination was defined as a visible rupture of the pericarp and testa [ 33 ]. GP and GI values were used to evaluate seed dormancy levels [ 34 ]: GI = (3\u00d7n1 + 2\u00d7n2 + 1\u00d7n3)/(3\u00d7N), where N is the total number of seeds per plate, and n1, n2, and n3 are numbers of germinated seeds on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively; GP is the number of germinated seeds on day 3 of the germination test/total number of seeds. For rice, seeds were harvested 35 d after flowering, soaked in 0.1% sodium hypochlorite for 15 min, washed thrice with distilled water, and placed in a Petri dish with two layers of filter paper to which 5 mL of distilled water had been added for the germination test. Germination phenotypes were recorded at different stages in an incubator at 28 \u00b0C during the day and 25 \u00b0C at night in a 16/8 h light/dark cycle [ 35 ]; germination was defined as when radicle reached half of the seed length [ 9 ]. For Arabidopsis , seeds were harvested at 28 d after flowering, then used for germination test. Seeds were placed in transparent square Petri dishes with two layers of filter paper moistened with distilled water, and grown in an incubator with a 16 h light (23 \u00b0C)/8 h dark (20 \u00b0C) cycle and 60% relative humidity. Germination criteria for Arabidopsis seeds were based on radicle protrusion [ 36 ]. To test rice panicle and wheat spike germination, at least five freshly harvested rice panicles and wheat spikes were soaked in 0.1% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min, then rinsed with distilled water for 6 h. Treated panicles and spikes were placed vertically in a thermostatic incubator at 25 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C, respectively, and sprayed with distilled water every 8 h, then photographed after 7 d [ 9 ]. TaSD6 and homologous gene cloning and molecular marker development Genome sequences of TaSD6 and two homologs were downloaded from IWGSC RefSeq v1.0. Specific amplification primers were designed using Premier v.5.0 ( www.premierbiosoft.com ) (Table S1 ). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with a 25 \u00b5L reaction system of DNA, Phanta Max Super-Fidelity polymerase (Nanjing, Novizen), primer, and water mixture for PCR amplification. PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, and products of target fragments were extracted for sequencing (Shanghai, Sangyo Biotech). Sequencing results were analyzed and aligned using DNAMAN version 6; promoter cis-elements were analyzed using PlantCARE ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ ). Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS) markers (Premier v.5.0) and Derived Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (dCAPS) markers ( http://helix.wustl.edu/dcaps/dcaps.html ) were developed based on sequence variations in TaSD6-7A promoter and coding regions. Specific primers were designed to amplify target fragments (Table S1 ), which were then digested with restriction endonucleases at specific temperatures for 10 h, and detected by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmid construction and transformation Specific primers were used to clone the coding region of TaSD6-7A in ZY9507 and SNTT. The coding regions of the TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C alleles were cloned into the pCAMBIA1305 vector containing the CaMV35S promoter. The recombinant plasmid was transfected into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 and introduced into wild type (WT) Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia, Col-0) using the floral dip method [ 36 ]. The seeds of T 0 transgenic plants were selected on 1/2 MS medium (pH 5.8) containing 50 mg/L hygromycin. Similarly, transgenic rice plants were obtained by transferring expression vectors of TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C into the root cancer Aspergillus strain EHV105, which was transformed into rice healing tissues through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [ 37 ]. Positive plants were selected for further analysis. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted using the TaKaRa MiniBEST Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Beijing, China); cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a reverse transcription kit. Specific primers are detailed in Table S1 . Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR qPCR Mix kit (Nanjing, Novozymes) CFX96 Light Reaction Module with AtActin7 and OsActin1 as internal reference specific primers [ 9 , 38 ]. Three biological replicates were performed for each experiment; relative gene expression levels were calculated using the 2 \u2212\u2206\u2206CT method [ 39 ]. Statistical analysis Phenotypic data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0 and Prism 8.0, with three biological replicates for each test. U- and t-tests were performed to identify significant differences (* P < 0.05 and ** P < 0.01). Results Cloning and sequence analysis of TaSD6 and homologous genes Twelve pairs of primers were designed to clone wheat homologous genes of SD6 [ TaSD6-7A (2975 bp), TaSD6-7B (3127 bp), and TaSD6-7D (3411 bp)] in SNTT (strong dormancy and PHS resistance) and ZY9507 (weak dormancy and PHS susceptibility) (Table S1 ). These three homologous genes all contain six exons, encoding 331, 339, and 338 amino acids, respectively. For TaSD6-7A , there were 15 mutations (12 SNP and three insertion/deletion mutations) in the promoter and one missense mutation in the fourth exon (Fig. 1 A). Several cis-elements (motifs) were identified in the promoter of TaSD6-7A , including ABREs (ABRE3a and ABRE4), AREs, chs-CMA2a, STREs, TATA-boxes, and CAAT-boxes, with G-boxes and MYB/MYC motifs. Notably, the TT/AA mutation at \u2212 1806 bp resulted in a change of the CAAT-box/TATA-box element, the C/T mutation at \u2212 1045 bp led to an increase in the G-box element, and the C/T mutation at + 1307 bp caused a change in Val/Ala (Fig. S1 ). No sequence variation was observed in TaSD6-7B and TaSD6-7D (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 Sequence variations of TaSD6 and homologous genes and their associations with seed dormancy. A Sequence analysis of three wheat homologous genes of SD6 in varieties Suiningtuotuo (SNTT, strong dormancy) and Zhongyou 9507 (ZY9507, weak dormancy), B and C Detection of CAPS marker: B TaSD6-7 A-1806 for TaSD6-7A in ZY9507 and SNTT by 2.0% agarose gel, with \u201cM\u201d representing the DNA marker (ZY9507 carries the allele TaSD6-7 A-1806-TT and SNTT carries TaSD6-7 A-1806-AA ); and C TaSD6-7 A-1045 for TaSD6-7A in ZY9507 and SNTT by 2.0% agarose gel (ZY9507 carries the allele TaSD6-7 A-1045-C and SNTT carries TaSD6-7 A-1045-T ), D Detection of dCAPS marker TaSD6-7 A + 1307 for TaSD6-7A in ZY9507 and SNTT by 2.0% agarose gel (ZY9507 carries the allele TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C and SNTT carries TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T ), E\u2013G Significant differences in GI values between wheat varieties with two allelic variations of: E TaSD6-7 A-1806 ( TaSD6-7 A-1806-TT and TaSD6-7 A-1806-AA ); F TaSD6-7 A-1045 ( TaSD6-7 A-1045-C and TaSD6-7 A-1045-T ); and G TaSD6-7 A + 1307 ( TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T ). Note: 22GI5-HB, 22GI5-SZ, 22GI5-HF, 23GI5-GH, 23GI5-HB, 23GI5-HF, and 23GI5-LK represent GI values measured on day 5 following harvest in 2022 for Huaibei (HB), Suzhou (SZ), and Hefei (HF), and in 2023 for Guohe (GH), HB, HF, and Longkang (LK), GI-Mean Representative average GI. A Student\u2019s t-test was used to evaluate statistical significance (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01) Associations of TaSD6-7A alleles with seed dormancy To investigate associations of sequence variations of TaSD6-7A with seed dormancy, based on the TT/AA (\u2212 1806 bp), C/T (\u2212 1045 bp), and C/T (+ 1307 bp) mutations in promoter and coding regions of TaSD6-7A , we developed two CAPS (TaSD6-7 A-1806 and TaSD6-7 A-1045) and one dCAPS (TaSD6-7 A + 1307) markers (Fig. 1 B\u2013D). Using these markers, we then genotyped 160 wheat varieties with different dormancy levels. Two allelic variations for each marker were identified, designated TaSD6-7 A-1806-TT and TaSD6-7 A-1806-AA for TaSD6-7 A-1806, TaSD6-7 A-1045-C and TaSD6-7 A-1045-T for TaSD6-7 A-1045, and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T for TaSD6-7 A + 1307 (Table S10 ). U-test results revealed highly significant differences in GI values between varieties with these allelic variations for each marker across seven environments ( P < 0.01). Wheat varieties carrying TaSD6-7 A-1806-AA , TaSD6-7 A-1045-T , and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T had significantly lower GI values (representing high dormancy levels) than those carrying TaSD6-7 A-1806-TT , TaSD6-7 A-1045-C , and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C ( P < 0.01) (Fig. 1 E\u2013G). These results indicate that sequence variations of TaSD6-7A are associated with phenotypic differences of seed dormancy. Roles of TaSD6-7A alleles in seed dormancy of rice and Arabidopsis Rice and Arabidopsis are typical model plants that are used usually for exploration of gene functions. Homologous genes controlling seed dormancy in different plant species (e.g., rice, Arabidopsis , wheat, barley, maize) often have conserved functions [e.g., AtABI3 / TaVp-1 / ZmVp-1 [ 17 ], AtDOG1 / TaDOG1L1 / HvDOG1L1 [ 40 ], OsSdr4 / TaSdr [ 22 ], and TaQsd1 / HvQsd1 ( HvAlaAT1 ) [ 26 ]]. To investigate the roles of TaSD6-7A alleles (+ 1307 bp, C/T) in rice seed dormancy, we overexpressed TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T in Nipponbare, and obtained 18 and 21 positive plants, respectively (Fig. S2A and B). Six positive overexpression lines (T 3 ) with high expression levels of TaSD6-7A , including three lines 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-C-#2/11/21 and three lines 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-T-#8/16/20 , were selected for germination tests (Fig. 2 D; Table S3 ). Seed GP values for 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-C-#2/11/21 were significantly higher than that of Nipponbare, while GP values for 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-T-#8/16/20 were significantly lower than that of Nipponbare (Fig. 2 A and B; Table S3 ). Moreover, germination behaviors of 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-T-#8/16/20 panicles were delayed compared with 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-C-#2/11/21 panicles (Fig. 2 C). There was no significant difference in grain length or width in overexpression lines carrying TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T compared with Nipponbare(Fig. S3 ). To explore the roles of TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T in Arabidopsis seed dormancy, we constructed two allele fusion expression vectors ( 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-C and 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-T ), and then heterogeneously overexpressed them in Col-0 to obtain 20 and 21 positive plants, respectively (Fig. S2C and D). Six positive overexpression lines (T 3 ) with high expression levels of TaSD6-7A , including the three lines 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-C-L1/4/5 and the three lines 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-T-L1/2/4 , were selected for germination tests (Fig. 3 C; Table S3 ). Seed GP values of 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-C-L1/4/5 were significantly higher than that of Col-0, and GP values of 35 S: TaSD6-7 A-T-L1/2/4 were significantly lower (Fig. 3 A and B; Table S3 ). These results indicate that TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T increases Arabidopsis seed dormancy levels, and TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C decreases them.

A Student\u2019s t-test was used to determine statistical significance (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01) Functional validation of TaSD6 and homologous genes in wheat EMS mutants To validate roles of TaSD6 and homologous genes in wheat seed dormancy, we obtained three wheat EMS mutants in the wheat cultivar J411 background (designated tasd6-7a , tasd6-7b , and tasd6-7d ). These EMS mutants have SNP (C/T) mutations at amino acids 233, 239, and 192 in the functional MYC-type, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domains of TaSD6-7A , TaSD6-7B , and TaSD6-7D , respectively (Fig. 4 A), resulting in early termination of translation. Seed GP values for tasd6-7a , tasd6-7b , and tasd6-7d were significantly lower than that of J411 (Fig. 4 B and C; Table S4). Additionally, germination behaviors of tasd6-7a , tasd6-7b , and tasd6-7d spikes were delayed compared with those of J411 (Fig. 4 D). These results indicate that the loss-of-function of TaSD6 and homologous genes promotes wheat seed dormancy. In addition, we found that plant heights of tasd6-7a , tasd6-7b , and tasd6-7d were lower than that of J411, tasd6-7d had longer spikes than J411 (Fig. 4 and S4 C), but no significant difference was observed in grain length or width between them (Fig. 4 E, G, H and S4 A-B).

Note: tasd6-7a , tasd6-7b , and tasd6-7d represent EMS mutants of TaSD6-7A , TaSD6-7B , and TaSD6-7D in the wheat cultivar J411 background, respectively. A Student\u2019s t-test was used to evaluate statistical significance (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01) Haplotype analysis and frequency distribution of TaSD6-7A To identify natural variations of TaSD6-7A in diverse wheat germplasms, we selected 100 representative varieties from the above 160 wheat varieties (Sect. \u201c Plant materials \u201d) to clone promoters (2000 bp) and exons. Sequence analysis revealed 20 mutations in promoter and coding regions of TaSD6-7A (Fig. 5 A). U-test results revealed that 17 of 20 mutations were significantly associated with seed dormancy across seven environments ( P < 0.01), and the remaining three mutations at \u2212 453 bp (ins/del), \u2212 286 bp (G/C), and \u2212 43 bp (A/T) were not associated with seed dormancy (Table S5 ). Haplotype analysis of TaSD6-7A was performed based on genotypic and phenotypic data of these 100 varieties. Of the four haplotypes ( HapI , HapII , HapIII , and HapIV ), HapI had the highest frequency (68%), with 68 varieties, then HapII (20%) with 20, HapIII (11%) with 11, and HapIV (1%) with one (Fig. 5 A and B). Significant differences in average GI values were observed between wheat varieties carrying each haplotype across environments. GI values of varieties carrying HapII were significantly lower than those carrying HapI , HapIII , and HapIV . Of these 100 varieties, 20 carried HapII , including three improved varieties (15%) and 17 landraces (85%) (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that the frequency of HapII associated with strong dormancy is significantly higher in landraces than in improved varieties.

A Student\u2019s t-test was used to evaluate the statistical significance (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01) Pyramiding effect of TaSD6-7A and known dormancy-related genes on seed dormancy To explore the potential value of TaSD6-7A in molecular breeding of wheat PHS resistance, we evaluated the pyramiding effect of TaSD6-7A and known dormancy-related genes on seed dormancy. We first detected six markers for six known dormancy genes ( MKK3-4 A for TaMKK3-4 A , Myb10-D1 for TaMYB10-D1 , VP1-b2 for TaVP1-3B , MFT-222 for TaMFT-3 A , Qsd1-5B for TaQsd1-5B , and PI4K-2 A-indel for TaPI4K-2 A ) in the above 160 wheat varieties (Fig. S5 ; Table S6-7 and S9 ). For each gene, we denoted the allele for strong dormancy R , and that for weak dormancy S (Table S9 ). We focused on changes in GI values of wheat varieties carrying different numbers of R alleles for TaSD6-7A and six known dormancy genes (0R, 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R, and 7R) (Table S8 ). Combining genotypic and phenotypic data, we found an increase in the number of R alleles to be associated with a gradual decrease in GI values. The mean GI of varieties with 7R was lowest (0.20), followed by 6R (0.22), 5R (0.30), 4R (0.43), 3R (0.54), 2R (0.60), 1R (0.61), and 0R (0.63) (Fig. 6 ). These results indicate that pyramiding R alleles can improve wheat seed dormancy levels. Fig. 6 Pyramiding effects of TaSD6-7A and known dormancy-related genes on seed dormancy. Note: 0R, 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R, and 7R represents the combination types with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 R alleles for the seven dormancy genes (including TaSD6-7A , TaMKK3-4 A , TaMYB10-D1 , TaVP1-3B , TaMFT-3 A , TaQsd1-5B , and TaPI4K-2 A ). The number in parentheses represents the number of varieties carrying the 0R, 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R, and 7R combination types. R indicates the PHS resistance allele Discussion Wheat and rice are grasses in which many genes are functionally conservative in regulating important agronomic traits [ 41 \u2013 44 ]. Xu et al. [ 9 ] reported the bHLH transcription factor gene SD6 to negatively regulate rice seed dormancy and PHS resistance, and this gene has considerable potential to improve PHS resistance in rice. Wheat is a heterohexaploid crop with many genetic variations in its three subgenomes [ 45 , 46 ]. However, sequence variations of TaSD6 and homologous genes in wheat, their roles in seed dormancy, and their frequency distributions remain unclear. In the present study, we reported that TaSD6-7A has many sequence variations in promoter and coding regions, while TaSD6-7B and TaSD6-7D have no sequence variation. For TaSD6-7A , the TT/AA variation at \u2212 1806 bp and the C/T variation at \u2212 1045 bp result in changes in cis-elements, and the C/T mutation at + 1307 bp causes changes in amino acid sequences (Fig. S1 ). To explore whether these three mutations influence seed dormancy, we developed three markers and validated their associations with seed dormancy using 160 wheat varieties with different dormancy levels (Fig. 1 E\u2013G; Table S2 ). We then confirmed the positive role of TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T and the negative role of TaSD6-7 A + 1307-C alleles in seed dormancy using transgenic rice and Arabidopsis lines and wheat EMS mutants. Our present findings provide new gene resources and markers for genetic improvement of PHS resistance in wheat and rice. Because TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T transgenic rice lines have strong dormancy levels and show no adverse effects on agronomic traits such as grain length and width, we suggest that this allele has breeding potential for improving PHS resistance in wheat and rice (Fig. 2 A and S3). More experimental data are required from transgenic wheat materials in the field to evaluate this hypothesis. Additionally, wheat EMS mutants of TaSD6-7A , TaSD6-7B , and TaSD6-7D have higher dormancy levels than wild-type J411, and their plant heights were lower, and their grain lengths and widths did not change significantly (Fig. 4 B-C and S4 A-B). Interestingly, TaSD6-7D wheat EMS mutant had a longer spike length than J411 (Fig. 4 F and S4 C). These observations imply that the loss-of-function of TaSD6-7A , TaSD6-7B , and TaSD6-7D improves wheat resistance to PHS, and increases grain yield and lodging resistance. Wheat is prone to PHS and lodging because of rainfall and strong wind. Because water remains on spikes, lodging will aggravate PHS disaster. Therefore, in rainy and windy areas, wheat varieties with PHS and lodging resistance are preferable. Taken together, we suggest that these three EMS mutants could be used as excellent genetic resources for breeding wheat varieties. Considering the abundance of sequence variation in TaSD6-7A , we also investigated natural variation by resequencing 100 wheat varieties. Of the 20 identified variants, 17 correlated significantly with seed dormancy in different environments, which contributes to the development of molecular markers for PHS resistance breeding (Fig. 5 A and S5 ). Four haplotypes were identified, among which HapII was significantly associated with stronger dormancy, but it mainly occurred in landraces and less in modern varieties (Fig. 5 B and C). We speculate that HapII has the potential to improve PHS resistance of modern varieties. PHS resistance is a complex quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes, and pyramiding different dormancy genes can improve wheat resistance to it. Lin et al. [ 47 ] used marker-assisted backcrossing to introgress PHS resistance genes TaPHS1 and TaMKK3-A into the sprouting-susceptible white wheat line NW97S186. A germination test of progeny revealed that pyramiding these genes increased PHS resistance. Wang et al. [ 29 ] reported that wheat accessions with more PHS-resistant alleles for TaMYB7-A1 , TaAIRP2-A1 , and TaMYB10-D genes tended to have lower seed germination rates (higher dormancy levels). We also investigated pyramiding effects of TaSD6-7A and six known dormancy genes on seed dormancy, and reported varieties with more dormancy alleles to have stronger seed dormancy. The combination types 7R (average GI = 0.20), 6R (average GI = 0.24), and 5R (average GI = 0.30) with low GI and high dormancy levels represent excellent germplasm resources for improving wheat resistance to PHS through gene pyramiding. Conclusion We cloned TaSD6 and homologous genes in common wheat, developed three molecular markers, and validated the role of TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T allele in enhancing seed dormancy. We further identified the HapII haplotype to be associated with high dormancy, and investigated the pyramiding effects of TaSD6-7A and known dormancy-related genes. Our findings provide new genetic resources and molecular markers for improving wheat PHS resistance. Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

    "full_text_abstract": "Background The bHLH transcription factor SD6 regulates rice seed dormancy. However, sequence variants of wheat SD6 homologs and their roles in seed dormancy remain unknown. Results Here, we cloned three wheat homologous genes of SD6 (named TaSD6-7A , TaSD6-7B , and TaSD6-7D ), and found that TaSD6-7A had abundant sequence variations, while TaSD6-7B and TaSD6-7D had no variation. Based on sequence variations in the promoter and coding regions of TaSD6-7A , we developed three molecular markers and verified their associations with seed dormancy in 160 wheat varieties. We further confirmed that the TaSD6-7 A + 1307-T allele positively regulated seed dormancy, but had no adverse effects on other important agronomic traits. Resequencing and phenotypic data indicated that the favorable haplotype TaSD6-7A HapII associated with high dormancy level was more common in landraces than in modern varieties. Additionally, we demonstrated the pyramid effects of TaSD6-7A with known dormancy-related genes in enhancing seed dormancy. Conclusion Overall, this study provides novel genetic resources and molecular markers for improving PHS resistance of modern wheat varieties.
