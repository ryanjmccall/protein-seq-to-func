    "abstract_text": "We report on a patient with the skeletal findings of Jackson-Weiss syndrome, who manifests only mild craniofacial anomalies. Molecular analysis of her fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) identified a heterozygous P252R missense mutation, previously only reported with FGFR1-Pfeiffer syndrome like manifestations. Mutations in the immunoglobulin-like, II-III (IgII-III) linker region of FGFR1 and FGFR3 molecules may present as a skeletal dysplasia affecting the appendicular skeleton including, brachydactyly, short broad middle phalanges, phalangeal epiphyseal coning and broad halluces. This communication is a further example of the phenomenon of an activated FGFR molecule resulting in overlapping manifestations in FGFR syndromes.",
