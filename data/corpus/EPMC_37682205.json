Introduction Aplastic Anemia (AA) defines cytopenias with hypoplastic bone marrow without abnormal infiltration and fibrosis in the bone marrow. [ 1 ] More than 100 years have passed since Ehrlich described the first AA case in a pregnant woman in 1888, and clinicians have now acquired more extensive knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of AA. [ 2 , 3 ] Drugs, chemicals, and radiation might cause direct damage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), viral infections, and clonal and genetic disorders cause autoimmune destruction by changing the immunological structure of HSCs. [ 1 ] Although cytotoxic T lymphocytes are the most effective elements of autoimmune aplasia in AA, Regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, IFN-gamma, cytokines, especially IL-17, and autoantibodies also play roles in the immune destruction of HSCs in AA. [ 4 ] As a result of this autoimmune destruction, cytopenia develops in 1 or more series in the peripheral blood. Cytopenia in 1 or more series that accompanies hypocellular bone marrow and satisfies the conditions for hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, platelet < 50,000/\u03bcL, and absolute neutrophil count < 1.500/\u03bcL are needed for diagnosis. Although most cases (70\u201380%) are idiopathic, it is important to take medication, occupational exposure, and family history carefully. [ 5 , 6 ] The incidence is 2 to 3 per million per year in Europe, but higher in East Asia. [ 7 ] There is a bimodal distribution peaking at 10 to 25 years of age and above 60 years of age, and there is no difference between male and female gender. [ 8 ] The 1-year mortality of untreated severe AA is > 70%. [ 9 ] Various therapeutic modalities, including corticosteroids, androgens, and splenectomy, were used for the treatment of patients with AA in ancient times. [ 10 , 11 ] The options in the treatment of AA have increased with the developments in recent years. AA treatment modalities vary according to the severity of the disease, the patient\u2019s age/performance, and donor presence, and involve supportive treatment (erythrocyte and platelet transfusion, iron chelation therapy, infection prophylaxis), immunosuppression, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) consists of equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) combined with cyclosporine A (ATG + cyclosporine A). Eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, has been shown to improve the hematologic response in AA. Therefore it was approved by the US food and drug administration for AA patients who were refractory to IST in 2014 and it received food and drug administration approval in combination with IST in the first-line setting in 2018. [ 12 ] The European Medicines Agency approved Eltrombopag in AA in 2015. This approval was intended for patients with severe AA who are resistant to IST and not amenabl to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT is the first-line treatment modality for patients < 40 years of age diagnosed with severe AA with an HLA-matched sibling donor. HSCT can be performed as the first-line treatment in the presence of an HLA-matched sibling donor in severe AA cases between the ages of 41 to 60 but IST can also be preferred. Unrelated donor HSCT/cord blood transplantation or haploidentical transplantation is also applied in patients who do not have an HLA-matched sibling donor but have severe/very severe AA, especially in patients < 20 years of age, or in patients who are unresponsive within 120 days even though IST was applied in the first step and who are suitable for stem cell transplantation. [ 6 , 13 ] Alemtuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody against CD52 expressed in lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cells in refractory AA patients who are not suitable for HSCT, might be used as a single agent or in combination with Cyclosporine A. [ 14 ] Patients who are treated with IST are regularly followed up for treatment-related toxicity and especially clonal progression (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndromes, transformation to acute leukemia). The main problems that might occur in AA patients who undergo HSCT are graft failure and graft-versus-host disease, and one of the long-term problems is the development of new malignancies. Malignancy rates that reached 3% after HSCT is reported in the literature. [ 15 ] Although AA might develop in pregnant women, a patient with AA might become pregnant. ATG cannot be used during pregnancy, but cyclosporine can be used in therapeutic doses because Cyclosporine has not been shown to have a negative impact on the baby. [ 16 ] As a result of the increased scientific literature in recent years, bibliometric analyzes have become a widely used quantitative research method for evaluating the relevant literature on a particular subject. [ 17 , 18 ] By providing comprehensive analyzes and structured information on a topic or a study area, bibliometrics helps to identify important points for future studies. [ 19 , 20 ] No bibliometric study has yet been conducted in the literature on AA. The present study aimed to provide an overview of AA for the period 1980 to 2022 by using bibliometric approaches and statistical methods. The researchers aimed to examine the distribution of scientific output on aplastic anemia across different research components (countries, institutions, journals, authors), summarize the intellectual nature of the subject, reveal global productivity, and identify recent study trends. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Search strategy The researchers used the Web of Science (WoS) (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA) database to obtain AA articles published from 1980 to 2022. The following search strategy was adopted in the study. (Title = (\u201cAplastic anemia*\u201d OR \u201cAplastic anemia*\u201d) AND Document Type = (Article) AND Publication time: 1980\u20132022). With the search strategy used, the researchers found all publications with Aplastic Anemia/Anaemia and Aplastic Anemias/Anaemias in their titles (the search was performed on April 1, 2023). Only original articles were included in the bibliometric analyses. 2.2. Statistical analysis Bibliometric analyzes were made with the VOSviewer (Version 1.6.19, Leiden University) package program. [ 21 ] Statistical analyzes were made with the SPSS (Version: 22.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) package program. The exponential Smoothing estimator was used in Microsoft Office Excel program to predict past and future publication trends in AA. A seasonal correction was made in the prediction model. The world map that showed the article density of the countries on AA was drawn by using the website ( https://app.datawrapper.de ). The conformity of the data to the normal distribution was evaluated with the Q-Q Plot, Histograms, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. The Spearman Correlation Coefficient was used for the correlation studies between the number of articles and economic data of the countries obtained from the World Bank [ 22 ] and WoS. The statistical significance level was taken as P < .05. 3. Results As a result of the literature review, the researchers found 6776 publications on AA that were published between 1980 and 2022. Among these studies, the researchers excluded 15 studies published in Veterinary Sciences, and among the remaining 6761 publications, 3221 (47.6%) were Articles, 2345 (34.7%) were Meeting Abstracts, 577 (8.5%) were Letters, 220 (3.2%) were Review Articles, 136 (2%) were Proceeding Papers, and the rest were in other publication types (Editorial materials, notes, book chapters, etc.). Bibliometric analyzes were performed with only 3221 articles. Almost all articles (95.2% (n = 3067)) were scanned in science citation index expanded, and 4.2% (n = 134) in emerging sources citation index indices. The few remaining articles were indexed in the social sciences citation index and 94.2% (n = 3035) of these articles were in English and the remaining 5.8% (n = 186) were in other languages [Russian (n = 61), German (55), Spanish (31), French (19), Japanese (8), Italian (4), Korean (3), Norwegian (1), Portuguese (1), Serbian (1), Slovenian (1), and Turkish (1)]. 3.1. Active research areas on aplastic anemia The primary study areas with 30 or more articles published on AA were Hematology (Number of articles = 1802), Oncology (463), Medicine General Internal (435), Immunology (395), Transplantation (327), Pediatrics (270), Medicine Research Experimental (209), Biophysics (140), Surgery (82), Cell Biology (73), Pharmacology Pharmacy (60), Pathology (50), Genetics Heredity (40), Gastroenterology Hepatology (34), Infectious Diseases (33), Medical Laboratory Technology (32), Biochemistry Molecular Biology (31), Biotechnology Applied Microbiology (30), and Cell Tissue Engineering (30), respectively. 3.2. Research trend of aplastic anemia from past to future The number of previously published articles on AA was modeled with the Exponential Smoothing Estimator, taking into account seasonal correction, and the number of articles that could be published in the next 5 years was estimated. The line graph that showed past and future broadcast trends along with estimations is given in Figure 1 . According to the model, it was estimated that 150 (Confidence Interval %: 121\u2013179) articles and 156 (CI %: 115\u2013196) studies will be published on AA in 2023 (Fig. 1 ). Figure 1. A line graph showing the change in published articles about aplastic anemia by year, along with a forecast for the next five years. 3.3. Prolific countries on aplastic anemia The bar graph showing the first 20 countries that contributed the most to the literature on AA and the world map showing the color intensity according to the number of articles are given in Figure 2 . The top 20 countries in terms of contribution to the scientific literature on AA were the USA (800, 24.8%), China (514, 15.9%), Japan (442, 13.7%), United Kingdom (252, 7.8%), Italy (184, 5.7%), Germany (164, 5%), France (160, 4.9%), India (138, 4.2%), Switzerland (135, 4.1%), South Korea (117, 3.6%), Canada (76, 2.3%), Netherlands (70, 2.1%), Brazil (65, 2%), Turkey (63, 1.9%), Spain (62, 1.9%), Russia (60, 1.8%), Austria (54, 1.6%), Sweden (53, 1.6%), Taiwan (43, 1.3%), and Mexico (35, 1%). Figure 2. A bar graph showing the top 20 contributing countries to the aplastic anemia literature and a world density map showing the productivity of all countries. International cooperation analysis was made among 82 countries that published articles on AA and scores showing the strength of cooperation were calculated. The top 15 countries with the highest collaboration according to these scores were; England in the United Kingdom (Total collaboration score = 423), France (395), Italy (379), Germany (376), Switzerland (357), the USA (319), Netherlands (227), Sweden (187), Spain (173), Saudi Arabia (158), Russia (100), Canada (99), Austria (98), Japan (87), and Belgium (86). A highly significant correlation was detected between the number of articles on AA and the gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP per capita values, which are indicators of the economic development of the countries ( R = 0.729, P < .001; R = 0.710, P < .001, respectively). 3.4.

Co-citation analysis regarding aplastic anemia There were 34,586 publications cited in the \u201cReferences\u201d sections of all 3221 articles that were published on AA. Among these, the 10 most influential studies with more than 190 co-citations belonged to Young et al [ 3 ] (2006, Number of co-citations: number of co-citations [NC]: 334), Camitta et al [ 10 ] (1979, NC: 305), Camitta et al [ 11 ] (1976, NC: 302), Marsh et al [ 5 ] (2009, NC: 250), Frickhofen et al [ 23 ] (1991, NC: 247), Bacigalupo et al [ 24 ] (1988, NC: 231), Champlin et al [ 25 ] (1983, NC: 203), Killick et al [ 6 ] (2016, NC: 199), Rosenfeld et al [ 26 ] (2003, NC: 197), and Socie et al [ 27 ] (1993, NC: 191). 4. Discussion When the distribution of the articles on AA between the years 1980 and 2022 was examined, 2 different publication trends were observed (1980\u20132013 and 2014\u20132022). An average of 65 articles (min-max: 46\u201385) were published per year between 1980 and 2013. An increasing trend in the number of articles started and an average of 114 articles (min-max: 80\u2013149) were published from 2014 to 2022 with the year 2014. According to the estimation findings for 2023 and the following years, the researchers predicted that research on AA will follow a weak upward trend. Although 14 of the top 20 countries that stood out in AA global productivity were developed countries (USA, Japan, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland, South Korea, Canada, Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Sweden, and Taiwan), 6 were developing countries with large economies (China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and Mexico). The high statistically significant correlation between the number of articles on AA and the GDP and GDP per capita values of the countries showed that the economic size of the countries also had an impact on the productivity of the articles on AA. The findings of the present study showed parallelism with the results of other studies on this subject in the literature. [ 17 , 18 ] The presence of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of AA and the high cost of this treatment can be considered among the reasons for the relationship found in the study. It was determined that the European countries (especially England in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Austria, and Belgium), USA, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada, and Japan were the pioneers in international cooperation in this respect. The journals that stood out in terms of contributing to the global literature on AA were found to be the British Journal of Haematology, Blood, Bone Marrow Transplantation, International Journal of Hematology, Annals of Hematology, Experimental Hematology, American Journal of Hematology, Acta Haematologica, European Journal of Haematology, Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Haematologica, Journal of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Acta Haematologica Japonica, and Hematology. The researchers can recommend that authors who want to have their studies published on this subject consider these journals first. When the average number of citations per article published by the journals was compared, the most influential journals were found to be Bone (average number of citations per article = 368), New England Journal of Medicine (290), Current Opinion in Hematology (197), Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (196), Biometrics (142), Journal of Clinical Oncology (141), Neurology-Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation (126), JAMA-Journal of The American Medical Association (105), Annals of Internal Medicine (101), Investigative Radiology (100), Journal of Virology (97), American Journal of Ophthalmology (95), Blood (95), and Thrombosis and Haemostasis (92). The researchers can recommend these journals to researchers who want their articles to see more impact. Among the articles, Yamaguchi et al [ 28 ] (2005) published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine with the title \u201cMutations in TERT, the gene for telomerase reverse transcriptase, in aplastic anemia,\u201d which was the study with the highest impact according to the total number of citations. The second most influential study was conducted by Storb et al [ 29 ] (1983) in the New England Journal of Medicine with the title \u201cGraft-versus-host disease and survival in patients with aplastic-anemia treated by marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings-beneficial impact of a protective environment.\u201d The third most influential study was conducted by Socie et al [ 27 ] (1993) with the title \u201cMalignant tumors occurring after treatment of aplastic anemia\u201d published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The 4th and fifth most influential studies were those of Frickhofen et al [ 23 ] (1991) and Yoshizato et al [ 30 ] (2015) published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The fact that 8 of the top 10 studies that had the most impact in terms of the total number of citations among all articles were published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that this journal stands out in terms of its level of impact on AA. Among all articles, the study that had the most impact (average per year = 46.3) according to the average number of citations per year was found to be Killick et al [ 6 ] (2016) published by the British Journal of Haematology. The second most influential study was that of Yoshizato et al [ 30 ] (2015) with the title \u201cSomatic mutations and clonal hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia.\u201d The third most influential study was Townsley et al [ 31 ] study (2017) titled \u201cEltrombopag Added to Standard Immunosuppression for Aplastic Anemia.\u201d The 4th most influential study was Dixon et al [ 32 ] study (2020) titled \u201cCOVID-19-related acute necrotizing encephalopathy with brain stem involvement in a patient with aplastic anemia.\u201d The fifth most influential study was Bacigalupo [ 13 ] (2017) article with the title \u201cHow I treat acquired aplastic anemia\u201d. According to the number of co-citations that were made by all articles, the prominent studies that had a high-impact were found to be those conducted by Young et al [ 3 ] (2006), Camitta et al [ 10 ] (1979), Camitta et al [ 11 ] (1976), Marsh et al [ 5 ] (2009), Frickhofen et al [ 23 ] (1991), Bacigalupo et al [ 24 ] (1988), Champlin et al [ 25 ] (1983), Killick et al [ 6 ] (2016), Rosenfeld et al [ 26 ] (2003), and Socie et al [ 27 ] (1993). The researchers recommend other researchers interested in this subject read these studies first. According to the findings of the cluster analysis, there were 9 main focuses of AA research; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, aplastic anemia treatments, immunosuppressive therapy (ATG, cyclosporine, and Eltrombopag), viruses (parvovirus B19, epstein-barr virus, COVID-19, hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia), clonal evolution (G-CSF, monosomy 7, Fanconi anemia, apoptosis), stem cells (mesenchymal stem cells, t cells, HSC, telomere), cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha), epidemiology/incidence and other bone marrow failure conditions (myelodysplastic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). According to the keyword analysis findings, trend topics that were studied more in the last decade (used in at least 8 different articles in recent years) were hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy, bone failure, eltrombopag, acquired aplastic anemia, survival, pediatrics, mesenchymal stem cells, COVID-19, hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, haploidentical donor, matched sibling donor, matched unrelated donor, conditioning regimen, haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, t cells, clonal evolution, and deferasirox. The trend topics in the last 3 years were eltrombopag, COVID-19, Treg, Th17, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide. The most cited keywords from past to present were found to be immunosuppression, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, anti-thymocyte globulin, incidence, graft failure, graft rejection, fludarabine, alemtuzumab, haploidentical, unrelated donor, relapse, alternative donor, dyskeratosis congenita, telomere, HLA, myelodysplastic syndromes, allogeneic transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and bone marrow transplantation. There has been no bibliometric study on AA in the literature so far. One of the superior aspects of the present study is that it is the first bibliometric study conducted on AA. The researchers preferred only the WoS Database in the literature review in the present study, which may be a limitation of the study. In many bibliometric studies conducted in the literature, in response to the WoS preference, the reasons were cited as the inability to perform citation and co-citation analyses in the PubMed Database, and the indexing of some journals with low impact levels in the Scopus Database. [ 17 , 18 ] It was preferred that the present study be based on the WoS Database because it included articles from journals with higher impact index indexed in science citation index expanded. [ 19 , 20 ] 5. Conclusion The present study showed the general trend of AA in scientific research. It was determined that trend research on AA in the last decade involved allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy, eltrombopag, mesenchymal stem cells, COVID-19, hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, haploidentical donor, matched unrelated donor, conditioning regimen, t cells, clonal evolution, and deferasirox. It was also found that the trend topics in the last 3 years were eltrombopag, COVID-19, Treg, Th17, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide. The global broadcast uptrend was found to be weak. This may be because of the lack of discovery of a novel therapeutic agent other than eltrombopag, which was approved in 2014 and the lack of fundamental changes in the IST and HSCT preparatory regimens over the years. It was also determined that the research leadership belonged to the USA, China, Japan, European countries (United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland), India, and South Korea, which have large economies, in the development of the AA literature. Although there are widespread international collaborations globally, the researchers think that studies on AA must also be encouraged in underdeveloped countries. This bibliometric analysis may offer researchers new ideas for future studies to be conducted on AA. Author contributions Conceptualization: Tuba Bulduk. Data curation: Tuba Bulduk.

    "full_text_abstract": "There is no bibliometric study in the literature on Aplastic Anemia (AA). In the present study, the purpose was to summarize the intellectual structure of the subject, uncover the global productivity in this respect, and identify the latest research trends by performing a bibliometric analysis of the articles published on AA. For this purpose, outputs for different research components of scientific outputs (i.e., countries, institutions, journals, and authors) were analyzed. A total of 3221 articles on Aplastic Anemia published between 1980 and 2022 were analyzed by using various statistical methods and bibliometric approaches. The Spearman Correlation Coefficient was used for correlation analysis and bibliometric network visualization maps were used to identify trending topics, citation analysis, and international collaborations. The top 3 contributing countries to the literature were the USA in this respect (800, 24.8%), China (514, 15.9%), and Japan (442, 13.7%). The top 3 most active institutions were the National Institutes of Health USA (n = 177), National Heart Lung Blood Institute (n = 153), and Udice French Research Universities (n = 136). The top 3 most productive journals were the British Journal of Haematology (n = 239), Blood (n = 181), and Bone Marrow Transplantation (n = 137). The most prolific author was Neal Stuart Young (n = 130). Specific keywords that were most frequently used in articles were severe aplastic anemia, immunosuppressive therapy, pediatrics/children, anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, myelodysplastic syndromes, Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, pancytopenia, eltrombopag, fludarabine, Graft-Versus-Host Disease, survival, apoptosis, cytokines , and cyclophosphamide . It was determined that the trend topics in recent years were eltrombopag, COVID-19, Treg, Th17, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, haploidentical donor/transplantation, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide. In the formation of the AA literature, it was determined that the research leadership belonged to the USA, China, Japan, European countries (United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland), India, and South Korea, which have large economies."
