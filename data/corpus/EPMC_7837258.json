  "abstract_text": "A newborn infant is reported who had aganglionic megacolon, renal hypoplasia, severe growth retardation, generalised hypotonia, and various dysmorphic features. Chromosome analysis of lymphocytes and fibroblasts showed a ring chromosome 10 with breakpoints at p13-15 and q26. AluI digestion showed that the ring chromosome was monocentric. FISH with an alpha satellite probe specific for chromosome 10 showed one signal only in about 20% of interphase nuclei. It is suggested that aganglionic megacolon could result from dynamic somatic mosaicism owing to loss of the ring chromosome.",
