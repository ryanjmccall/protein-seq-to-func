    "abstract_text": "The amino acid sequences of human interleukin-6 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor are approximately 30% homologous in the N-terminal region. The relative positions of four half-cystines in human interleukin-6 (IL-6) match four of the five in human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Labeling experiments of recombinant interleukin-6 with tritiated iodoacetate confirmed that the molecule forms two intramolecular disulfide bonds and contains no detectable level of free sulfhydryls. By isolation and characterization of tryptic and subtilytic peptides obtained from different proteolytic digestions, the disulfide bonds of the IL-6 molecule were assigned to Cys44-Cys50 and Cys73-Cys83. The two disulfide bridges form two small loops which are separated by 22 amino acids. These structures are similar to those of recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor.",
