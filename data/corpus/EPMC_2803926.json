    "abstract_text": "We have investigated the possibility that structural alterations of the 'nuclear' oncogene family (c-myc, N-myc, L-myc, fos, myb and p53) leading to aberrant expression might, as in several other tumour types, play a role in the multi-stage development of tumorigenesis in the human thyroid follicular cell. Direct analysis of expression by slot and Northern blot RNA hybridisation showed that normal thyroid expresses surprisingly high levels of fos, and to a lesser extent c-myc, c-myc expression was markedly increased in all tumours, both benign and malignant, but no increase was seen in any other nuclear oncogene. fos expression was reduced specifically in one type of malignant tumour-follicular carcinoma-in inverse correlation with differentiation. Southern blot analysis showed no evidence of rearrangement or amplification of c-myc, or of any other 'nuclear' oncogene in any thyroid tumour. We conclude that there is no evidence that a primary abnormality of these genes plays a role in thyroid follicular cell tumorigenesis and suggest that the observed changes in expression can be adequately explained as secondary consequences of the tumour phenotype.",
