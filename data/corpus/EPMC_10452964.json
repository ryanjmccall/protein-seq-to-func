    "abstract_text": "The increased glycation of plasma apolipoproteins represents a possible major factor for lipid disturbances and accelerated atherogenesis in diabetic patients. The glycation of apolipoprotein E (apoE), a key lipid-transport protein in plasma, was studied both in vivo and in vitro. ApoE was shown to be glycated in plasma very low density lipoproteins of both normal subjects and hyperglycemic, diabetic patients. However, diabetic patients with hyperglycemia showed a 2-3-fold increased level of apoE glycation. ApoE from diabetic plasma showed decreased binding to heparin compared to normal plasma apoE. The rate of Amadori product formation in apoE in vitro was similar to that for albumin and apolipoproteins A-I and A-II. The glycation of apoE in vitro significantly decreased its ability to bind to heparin, a critical process in the sequestration and uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins by cells. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, a transition metal chelator, had no effect on the loss of apoE heparin-binding activity, suggesting that glycation rather than glycoxidation is responsible for this effect. In contrast, glycation had no effect on the interaction of apoE with amyloid beta-peptide. ApoE glycation was demonstrated to be isoform-specific. ApoE(2) showed a higher glycation rate and the following order was observed: apoE(2)>apoE(4)>apoE(3). The major glycated site of apoE was found to be Lys-75. These findings suggest that apoE is glycated in an isoform-specific manner and that the glycation, in turn, significantly decreases apoE heparin-binding activity. We propose that apoE glycation impairs lipoprotein-cell interactions, which are mediated via heparan sulfate proteoglycans and may result in the enhancement of lipid abnormalities in hyperglycemic, diabetic patients.",
