  "title": "Monoclonal antibodies neutralizing mammalian DNA topoisomerase I activity.",
  "year": 1988,
  "source_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/2461859",
  "source": "MED",
  "abstract_text": "We have isolated three different monoclonal antibodies specific for mammalian type-I DNA topoisomerase. The antibodies react with three closely adjacent epitopes located in a central section of the enzyme (between amino acid residues 344 and 483). Two of the antibodies inhibit an early step of the nicking/closing pathway. We provide evidence showing that the antibodies do not block the association of the enzyme with DNA. The antibodies are useful for immunocytochemical investigation and for further exploration of the biochemical function of mammalian type-I DNA topoisomerase.",
