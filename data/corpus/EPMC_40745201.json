AD remains one of the greatest medical challenges, with a global prevalence of around 30 million individuals and projections of a potential increase to 100 million by 2050 if efficacious prevention and treatment methods are undiscovered 2 . Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that progresses over time, manifesting primarily through impairments in memory and cognition 3 , 4 . Pathologically, AD is characterized by extracellular senile plaques (SPs), intracellular nerve fiber tangles, cholinergic neuron impairment, and synaptic changes in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and other brain regions. AD is a multifactorial disease involving apoptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and energy metabolism dysregulation 5 . Advanced age is the primary risk factor for developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, with the incidence of dementia increasing significantly after the age of 65. Genetic risk factors for AD include variations in apolipoprotein E, TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7. Additionally, AD can be inherited through APP and PSEN1/2 mutations.Despite significant investments and dedicated efforts in developing pharmaceutical interventions aimed at slowing down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), clinical trials have primarily yielded unsatisfactory outcomes 6 – 8 . The investigation of the distinct metabolites found in edible and medicinal fungi has garnered significant attention, mostly due to their minimal adverse effects and the promise they have for enhancing patient recovery rates 9 . While mushroom fruiting bodies are commonly consumed as food, edible and medicinal fungi metabolites are more suitable as potent and effective pharmaceutical compounds 10 , 11 . For instance, edible and medicinal fungal polysaccharides exhibit various beneficial properties such as anti-tumor, antioxidation, free radical scavenging, immunomodulatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic, anti-diabetic, and analgesic effects 12 – 16 . Pholiota adiposa is a popularly cultivated fungus in China renowned for its edibility and medicinal qualities. This fungus is abundant in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, amino acids, polysaccharides, lectins, and vital minerals 17 – 19 . It possesses several beneficial effects, including antioxidant activity, immune activity regulation 20 , hypoglycemic effects 21 , and anti-tumor activity 22 . Furthermore, in vivo studies have shown that the ethanol extract exhibits anti-tumor effects through the promotion of apoptosis and the inhibition of angiogenesis 23 . Pholiota adiposa, like other edible fungi, can elicit adverse reactions in a minority of individuals, manifesting as indigestion 24 and allergic symptoms 25 . Overconsumption may lead to poisoning symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, headache, and elevated heart rate 26 . Moreover, certain compounds in Pholiota adiposa could interact with particular medications, particularly noteworthy for individuals using immunosuppressants or anticoagulants 18 . Machine learning employs algorithms to generate predictions from input data, providing objectivity and precision compared to manual calculations. Network pharmacology, drawing from systems biology and pharmacology, explores the complex network relationships among “drug-gene-target-disease” using technologies such as genomics and network analysis. By incorporating a multidimensional approach to understanding the molecular underpinnings of diseases and predicting drug pharmacological mechanisms, it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs, their mechanisms of action, and potential adverse reactions. Investigating the anti-Alzheimer’s disease (AD) effect of Pholiota adiposa presents challenges due to its adherence to traditional pharmacological principles based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, applying network pharmacology offers a viable approach to investigating the pharmacological mechanism using big data and computer technology 27 . In a previous study, we employed network pharmacology to identify the resistance target of cordycepin against AD 28 . Network characteristics were analyzed by examining the nodes and pathways within the biological network. This clarifies the mechanism of drug action and presents an effective method for developing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).Network pharmacology is widely used in TCM research, encompassing active ingredient and potential target screening, unveiling intricate drug prescription mechanisms for treating diseases, and exploring the medicinal properties of diverse medications. The integration of TCM databases and computer software has advanced the research standards in this field and substantially contributed to TCM internationalization. Herein, we employed network pharmacology to investigate potential targets for counteracting AD (Fig. 1 ). Subsequently, we analyzed protein interactions, gene ontology (GO) functions, and pathway enrichment between Kyoto target and target groups. We also examined the correlation between potential targets and genes associated with the disease and aging and employed LASSO regression and random forest (RF) to construct models for target screening.We verified the core target using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. This thorough examination aimed to elucidate the complete molecular mechanism underlying the anti-Alzheimer’s disease (AD) effect, we assessed the clinical significance of core targets using the GEO database. Fig. 1 Network pharmacology workflow of Pholiota adiposa in the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease. Methods Screening of the active component target In the endeavor to identify the active compound in Pholiota adiposa , we employed ‘ Pholiota adiposa ’ from the NPASS database and sought its ‘smile value’ in Super-Pred, SEA, and Swiss Target Prediction. This approach facilitated the visualization of the compound’s structure and the anticipation of its molecular targets, amalgamating insights from these databases. Selection of anti-AD targets in Paliota adiposa The term “Alzheimer’s disease (AD)” was queried in the CTD, OMIM, and GeneCards databases to discover genes associated with the disease. A dataset was compiled by condensing and weighting the gathered data tables. The active constituents of Pholiota adiposa were matched with targets relevant to AD for the identification of crucial targets. Venny 2.1 was employed to determine the common targets and illustrate the outcomes using a Venn diagram. GO and KEEG enrichment analysis GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted on genes linked to ‘compound-disease targets’ through the DAVID tool provided by the National Cancer Institute and the bioinformatics platform. The analyses focused on the top 20 most significant enrichments, with a significance threshold set at p ≤ 0.05. The construct of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network The compound targets and genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were incorporated into the STRING database, with a focus on ‘Homo sapiens’ and a minimum confidence score of 0.7. Subsequently, Cytoscape was utilized to analyze the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, employing the NetworkAnalyzer and NCODE plugins to compute topological parameters and centrality measures. Core genes were pinpointed by selecting nodes with values exceeding the median from the PPI network analysis. Correlation analysis of core target and AD key genes To investigate the connections between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) key genes and the primary targets of Pholiota adiposa, a correlation analysis was conducted using the AlzData database. The targets from compound-target and disease-target databases were integrated into AlzData to investigate the relationships between core genes and Aβ or Tau proteins, utilizing the curated CFG databases. Furthermore, these genes were compared with the Aging Atlas to pinpoint those strongly linked to aging and Aβ or Tau proteins, subsequently identified as key genes. Clinical significance of core targets The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at NCBI was queried using the term ‘AD’ to identify gene expression data specific to Alzheimer’s disease in humans. The search was narrowed to Homo sapiens, and the GSE33000 dataset was selected for analysis. This dataset included 157 control cases and 310 Alzheimer’s disease cases from the postmortem prefrontal cortex (BA9). Differential gene expression analysis was conducted between the AD and control groups, focusing on genes with a log2 fold change (|log2FC|) greater than 0.2 and a p-value less than 0.05. The limma package in R was used for this analysis, and the ggplot2 package was employed to create a volcano plot visualizing the results. Additionally, the Human eFP Browser 29 was used to analyze the expression patterns of key targets in the nervous system and generate corresponding gene maps. Identification of key genes using machine learning methods Through network pharmacology analysis, we pinpointed key genes and stratified the GSE33000 dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Prediction models were constructed employing Lasso regression and random forest (RF) techniques to identify crucial genes. Internal validation of each model was conducted using the test subset. Evaluation criteria encompassed the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for individual genes, with an AUC range of 0.5–0.7 indicating low accuracy, 0.7–0.9 suggesting moderate accuracy, and above 0.9 indicating high accuracy. Molecular docking Molecular docking was employed to forecast the binding mode and affinity between the active components of Pholiota adiposa and their target proteins. The protein’s PDB structure was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, while the 2D configuration of the active components was retrieved from PubChem. Preceding the docking process, both ligands and receptors underwent energy minimization, removal of non-essential molecules, and addition of hydrogen atoms. Autodock Vina software 30 facilitated the docking procedure, unveiling the optimal conformation and minimal binding energy for the interactions between ligands and receptors. The resultant structural visuals were rendered using PyMOL 31 . Molecular dynamics simulation Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using GROMACS 2022.3 software 32 , 33 . Small molecules were preprocessed with AmberTools 22, utilizing the GAFF force field. Gaussian 16 W facilitated the molecular hydrogenation and calculation of RESP potentials, which were subsequently integrated into the molecular dynamics topology file. The simulation was conducted at a constant temperature of 300 K and pressure of 1 bar, employing the AMBER99sb-ildn force field and the TIP3P water model. To maintain charge neutrality, Na + ions were introduced. The system underwent minimization via the steepest descent method, followed by NVT and NPT equilibration stages, each comprising 100,000 MD steps with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps over 100 ps. Subsequently, a production simulation of 5,000,000 MD steps at a 2-femtosecond increment was performed, totaling 100 nanoseconds. Post-simulation analysis encompassed calculations of RMSD, RMSF, and rotation radius, along with free energy analysis using the MMPBSA method. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) Inhibition assay To investigate the potential therapeutic effects of Pholiota adiposa on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an in vitro experiment was conducted involving an acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay. The dried fruiting bodies of Pholiota adiposa were crushed, and extracted with a 50% methanol solution at a ratio of 1:10. The resulting extract was freeze-dried to obtain a dry extract, which was then dissolved in water to create solutions with concentrations of 1 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 7.5 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL. The experiment followed the Ellman method, utilizing reagents such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCh), and 5,5’-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB). The procedure began by adding 120 µL of PBS buffer with a pH of 8.0 to a 96-well plate, followed by 20 µL of the 1 mg/mL test sample solution, and 15 µL of AChE solution. After thorough mixing, the plate was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, 10 µL each of DTNB and ATCI were added, mixed well, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The activity of AChE was determined by measuring the absorbance of the sample at a wavelength of 405 nm. The experiment included a blank control group using PBS buffer instead of the sample, a positive control group with tacrine, and treatment groups with various concentrations of Pholiota adiposa extracts. The results of the treatment groups were then compared and analyzed against the negative control and the positive control (tacrine) to calculate the inhibition rate and the half-inhibition concentration (IC50). Results Intersection of active ingredients and AD targets Pholiota adiposa had 13 components (Table 1 ), and the active ingredients were searched through the NPASS database. The smile value could not be queried for four components (Beta-Caryophyllene, Demethylcryptojaponol, Rosmanol and Isorosmanol) in the database. A total of 136 targets were obtained by inputting nine chemical components into the Super-pred, SEA, and Swiss Target Prediction online database. The Alzheimer’s disease targets were collected from the Comparative Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and The Human Gene Database (GeneCards), resulting in 2,848 potential targets (Inference-Score > 30) after eliminating duplicates.A total of 112 therapeutic targets were obtained by mapping compound and disease-related targets using the Venny diagram (Fig. 2 A–C).

Pholiota adipose-related target network diagram (B). Pholiota adiposa-anti-Alzheimer’s disease target PPI (C). GO enrichment analysis The 112 common genes were analyzed using DAVID for GO enrichment and pathway analysis (Fig. 2 B, C), with a P-value threshold of < 0.001. The GO analysis categorized the genes into 194 terms: 152 related to Biological Process, 12 to Cellular Component, and 30 to Molecular Function. Notably, the genes were significantly associated with cocaine response, inhibition of protein phosphorylation, and modulation of RNA polymerase II activity, suggesting a role in synaptic function and AD defense mechanisms. KEGG pathways enrichment analysis Figure 3 highlights the top 20 KEGG pathways significantly associated with the 112 common targets, including ‘central carbon metabolism in cancer,’ ‘prostate cancer,’ ‘HIF-1 signaling pathway,’ and ‘PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.’ These pathways indicate that Pholiota adiposa may stabilize neuronal cells by regulating synaptic membrane synthesis and inhibit protein phosphorylation to reduce neuronal inflammation. Additionally, it could influence AD-related protein deposition through central carbon metabolism, suggesting multifaceted anti-AD potential.

Screening of the target and core component interaction network for Pholiota adiposa- AD key targets The protein interactions among the candidate’s target genes were analyzed using the online STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ ). To establish a high-confidence correlation, the node data was screened using a threshold of 0.700. The processed gene symbol data was then visually displayed on the network using Cytoscape 3.9.1 software (Fig. 4 A). According to the analysis of topological parameters, the network was constructed with the degree, betweenness, and closeness of the criterion. Subsequently, we calculated the median value for degree, betweenness, and closeness of all nodes and identified nodes with values greater than or equal to the median as core components and core targets. The interaction information between the first 14 genes was analyzed using the STRING database, resulting in the identification of the core target, STAT3, along with other genes: STAT3, PRKCA, NF-κB1, CDK1, TERT, CFTR, PIK3R1, HIF1A, ITGB1, ITGB3, HSP90AA1, MTOR, ESR1, PRKAA1 and RXRA (Fig. 4 B). Additionally, the core ingredients carnosol, carnosic acid, and clovane diol were identified (Fig. 4 C–D). Fig. 4 Screening active ingredients of Pholiota adiposa for anti-Alzheimer’s disease. Core Target Network Diagram (A)；Association Between Core Targets and Core Components (B); Topological Analysis of Core Components (C); Screening Results of Core Components (D) Screening core targets using the entire network A correlation analysis by AlzData revealed significant positive correlations between STAT3 and NF-κB1 with β-amyloid (Aβ), and a significant positive correlation between STAT3 and tau protein. However, CFTR demonstrated a significant negative correlation with Tau (Table 2 ). Aging is a significant contributor to and hastens cognitive decline, making it the the principal risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Through the AgingAtlas database analysis, we obtained five age-related indicators (Table 1 ). The findings revealed that STAT3, PRKCA, NF-κB1, CDK1, and TERT displayed a higher CFG ranking than the median and exhibited age-related associations. Based on these observations, We hypothesize thatthese five targets are central to preventing and treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through the use of Pholiota adiposa (Table 3 ).

Figure 5 D, E display the mRNA expressions of STAT3 and NF-κB1, PRKCA, and TERT, which were significantly increased in AD patients. The eFP analysis examined mRNA expression levels of key genes in the healthy nervous system and uncovered diverse levels of gene expression. Figure 5 F demonstrate the broad expression of STAT3 and NF-κB1 in the normal human nervous system. In contaercirast, the hippocampus, subthalamic nucleus, and nodose nucleus show the highest expression levels of PRKCA. Nevertheless, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) shows high expression in the substantia nigra, VTA, and parietal lobe within the nervous system.

Identification of key genes using machine learning methods To identify key genes associated with anti-Alzheimer’s disease, we utilized machine learning to establish an optimal model and determine gene ranking. The training set comprised 80% of the data in GSE33000, with the remaining 20% allocated to the verification set. Employing random forest and LASSO regression algorithms, we identified core genes related to aging through LASSO regression (Fig. 6 A, B and E) and random forest analysis (Fig. 6 C, D). Subsequently, we performed a combined analysis of these core genes, revealing two intersecting genes—STAT3 and NFKB1 (refer to Fig. 6 F). Fig. 6 A LASSO coefficient spectrum of candidate genes; B: Cross-validation for selecting the optimal tuning parameter log2 λ in LASSO regression analysis; C: Random Forest Error Rate Curve; D: Ranking of core genes identified by the random forest algorithm; E: Key genes identified by LASSO algorithm; F: Venn diagrams of intersecting genes. Each classification algorithm exhibits a distinct impact on various training datasets, aiming to mitigate overfitting. We employ standard metrics like accuracy, recall rate, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC value for evaluation. AUC, denoting the area under the ROC curve, signifies higher classification accuracy with increasing values. To assess the diagnostic significance of these genes, we utilized the pROC package for analyzing expression data from dataset GSE33000 and plotting the ROC curve. Notably, both STAT3 and NFKB1 had AUC values exceeding 0.8 in the training set (refer to Fig. 7 A–M). These findings further support the pivotal roles of these genes in AD, showcasing remarkable diagnostic efficacy and performance in AD diagnosis. Fig. 7 The ROC curve verification of key genes(A.STAT3; B. NFKB1; C. RXRA; D. HIF1A; E. ITGB1; F. ESR1; G. CFTR; H. PIK3R1; I. HSP90AA1; J. PRKCA; K. ITGB3; L. PRKAA1; M. TERT). Molecular docking analysis The molecular docking analysis key findings underscored the potential interactions between the core active components found in Pholiota adiposa and specific target proteins. For comprehensive details on the docking procedures, please consult Supplementary Table 1 , which offers a thorough insight into the binding energies, interactions of key amino acid residues, and potential binding modes for each active component. Of particular interest was the interaction between the active compound Carnosol and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular responses, including inflammatory responses and cell proliferation, processes closely linked to the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Fig. 8 ). Our study’s molecular docking analysis revealed that Carnosol could establish stable hydrogen bonds and robust electrostatic interactions with key amino acid residues of STAT3. Specifically, Carnosol formed strong hydrogen bonds with STAT3’s LEU855, GLY856, and LYS857, crucial for inhibiting STAT3 activity. The overactivation of STAT3 is implicated in neuroinflammation and cell death in AD; thus, Carnosol may inhibit this activation, potentially representing one of Pholiota adiposa ’s mechanisms in benefiting AD (Fig. 9 B). Moreover, the binding analysis of NF-κB disclosed the involvement of critical amino acid residues, including ILE413, VAL414, and HIS418 (Fig. 9 E), which are pivotal in NF-κB signaling. NF-κB is central to regulating cellular stress and inflammatory responses, and its activation in AD progression can induce neuroinflammation and neuronal harm.

MD simulation The molecular dynamics simulation focused on the core component, carnosol, and its interaction with the core gene STAT3. This step aimed to provide validation for the results derived from both the network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses (Fig. 10 ). The Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) serves as a metric for evaluating protein dynamics. In the RMSF plot (Fig. 10 A), peaks indicate the regions of highest protein fluctuation during the simulation, while lower RMSF values reflect smaller conformational changes. Large fluctuations in the RMSF values (840–1150) were observed in the carnosol-STAT3 model, indicating substantial changes in the protein structure during the molecular dynamics simulation.These fluctuations can be attributed to a break in the amino acid chain within this specific protein region. During the simulation, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) serves as an indicator for evaluating changes in the protein structure. This metric provides insightful information regarding the stability of the protein and the simulation balance. Figure 10 B demonstrates that the RMSD values between proteins and small molecules were initially large within the first 60 nanoseconds of simulation, gradually reaching a stable state. The trend of RMSD value for the protein-small molecule complex aligns with that of the protein, indicating that the protein greatly influences the binding state of the complex during the docking process. Overall, the RMSD values remain within a narrow range, implying a relatively stable binding between the protein and small molecule. The gyration is used as an indicator of the overall compactness of the protein. In this simulation, we calculated the gyration between proteins and small molecules and plotted a gyration chart (Fig. 10 C). The results consistently showed a reduction in protein gyration value of protein after binding with small molecules, suggesting that binding small molecules induces a more compact conformation in protein molecules. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is a numerical measure employed to assess the degree of protein surface exposure The results (Fig. 10 D) indicated that the SASA value of protein significantly varied upon binding with the small molecule, exhibiting an initial increase and subsequent decrease. Additionally, the SASA exhibited a small decrease from 40 to 60 ns after binding to the ligand, suggesting that the small molecule potentially achieved the proper conformation following repeated collisions with the active site within the protein pocket, ultimately attaining an equilibrium state. These findings demonstrate successful binding and a progressive conformational tightening of the protein, leading to the gradual stabilization of complex structure during the simulation period. We used HBond, a metric for assessing hydrogen bonds between proteins and small molecules, to calculate the hydrogen bonds in all systems over a 100 ns simulation period. The results demonstrate (Fig. 10 G) that the hydrogen bonds in the complexes consistently occur throughout the kinetic simulation process, with the carnosol-STAT3 complexes having at least one hydrogen bond. Thus, these findings suggest that small molecules can form stable complexes with proteins. Several other indicators must be considered to assess the reasonableness of protein-small molecule binding. One commonly employed indicator in molecular biology research is the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) analysis. By calculating the energy of both the proteins and small molecules (Fig. 10 F–H), the overall free energy of the complex was determined to be − 35.92, indicating a highly stable binding. Additionally, the free energies of VAL: 863, SER: 936, and LEU: 983 were found to be − 1.642, − 1.01, and − 1.891, respectively, demonstrating the strong association of these three amino acid residues and small molecules during the docking process (Fig. 10 E). Based on the findings presented above, it can be inferred that the interaction between carnosol and STAT3 is robust. Additionally, the binding of small molecules leads to a compact conformation of the protein molecules, reducing the surface area and forming hydrogen bonds.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay The Ellman method was utilized to assess the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by the Pholiota adiposa extract in vitro. Various concentrations of the extract were examined, and the impact on AChE activity was determined by measuring the absorbance change at 405 nm. An inhibition rate of 7.68% was observed at 1 mg/mL, while at 10 mg/mL, the inhibition rate increased to 42.7% (Fig. 11 C, D). The group treated with Pholiota adiposa exhibited a significant reduction in AChE activity compared to the negative control group ( p < 0.01), indicating a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect. Evaluation of the inhibition rates at different concentrations revealed an IC50 value of 14.25 mg/mL for the Pholiota adiposa extract against AChE (Fig. 11 A), suggesting a potent inhibitory capability. In comparison, the positive control, tacrine, had an IC50 value of 0.2233 mg/mL in the experiment (Fig. 11 B). Fig. 11 The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Pholiota adiposa extract on AChE activity (A), the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the positive control Tacrine on AChE activity (B), the inhibitory effect of various concentrations of Pholiota adiposa extract and the positive control Tacrine on AChE activity (C), and the heatmap of the inhibitory effect of Pholiota adiposa extract and the positive control Tacrine on AChE activity (D). Discussion Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is recognized as a progressive neurological condition, primarily characterized by a gradual deterioration of memory and cognitive functions. The pathological hallmarks of AD encompass the extracellular aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides into senile plaques (SPs), and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Moreover, AD has been correlated with a reduction in acetylcholine levels, inflammatory responses, neuronal degeneration, and the presence of amyloid angiopathy. With the ongoing trend of an aging global population, the incidence of AD is on the rise, posing a growing challenge to both individuals and society. Cordycepin inhibits death-induced signaling complex formation by specifically binding to cysteine endopeptidase in mitochondria. This interaction occurs during apoptosis and impedes death signal complex assembly involving endopeptidases recruited in the death domain. By interfering with apoptosis activation, cordycepin delays neuronal cell death, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in AD. The major constituents of carnosol, carnosic acid, and clovane diol from Pholiota adiposa primarily alleviate AD progression by exerting anti-inflammatory effects. Carnosol, a terpenoid compound, exhibits various immunomodulatory effects, including antihypertensive 34 , anti-inflammatory 35 , 36 , anti-tumor 37 – 39 , and anti-fibrotic activities 40 . Carnosic acid exhibits inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase 41 . Moreover, Carnosic acid and Carnosol protect neurons from ischemic injury by scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species 42 , 43 . Moreover, these compounds have the potential to alleviate the accumulation of pathogenic proteins and cognitive decline in models of neurodegenerative diseases. They achieve this by enhancing protein homeostasis and improving mitochondrial function 44 . Some studies have suggested potential pharmacological activities of clovane diol 45 , indicating its possible contribution to neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement 46 . Suekaew et al. 47 . conducted a study demonstrating the potential of clovane diol in minimizing neuronal damage by effectively suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation. This suggests its promising role in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that clovane diol improves the survival and growth of nerve cells and facilitates nerve regeneration 48 . To enhance the accuracy of Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers, two machine learning algorithms, LASSO and RF, were utilized to identify core genes. LASSO regression screened seven candidate genes, while the RF algorithm pinpointed four significant genes (importance ≥ 1). The integration of both algorithms yielded two intersecting genes, STAT3 and NFKB1, indicating their potential as crucial treatment targets for Alzheimer’s disease. The LASSO regression and Random Forest (RF) were chosen for their prowess in managing intricate biomedical datasets 49 , 50 . LASSO, with its L1 penalty, refines variable selection and mitigates multicollinearity, simplifying the model by diminishing the impact of less significant features 51 . This clarity enhances both interpretability and predictive power 52 . On the other hand, RF, an ensemble technique, fortifies predictions by constructing multiple decision trees and consolidating their results 53 . It also assesses feature significance, vital for pinpointing pivotal biomarkers. Our comparison with conventional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) revealed that LASSO and RF outperform them in both predictive accuracy and feature selection. While SVM is adept at delineating classification boundaries, it falls short in variable selection compared to LASSO. k-NN, effective for smaller datasets, becomes computationally intensive and susceptible to outliers in larger datasets. Although deep learning excels at recognizing complex patterns, it requires substantial data for training and offers less interpretability. Our machine learning strategy not only improves predictive precision but also substantiates the identification of key biomarkers through a multi-model framework. The synergistic application of LASSO and RF provides an efficient feature selection process that uncovers underlying patterns and correlations, fostering new avenues for generating biological hypotheses. This approach is tailored to handle the high dimensionality and complexity inherent in high-throughput data, thus driving progress in personalized and precision medicine. By employing these advanced analytical tools, we can gain a more profound understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease, potentially leading to the discovery of biomarkers for therapeutic development. Inflammation is a critical factor in the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Gulen et al. 54 suggested that inflammation could be the underlying cause of these conditions. Therefore, Chakrabarty et al. 55 . conducted a study wherein they discovered that the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in transgenic mice resulted in increased deposition of Aβ protein. This increase was found to exacerbate cognitive impairment and further accelerate the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 56 . Inflammation is a prominent aging feature, causing cellular and molecular damage. Oxidative stress can trigger inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK, thereby leading to increased production of cytokines and chemokines. Prolonged inflammation loses its protective effect and contributes to Aβ accumulation, impaired clearance, enhanced tau hyperphorylation, neuronal loss, and AD deterioration 57 – 61 . Aging and inflammation are closely interconnected, with chronic inflammation often regarded as a hallmark of aging. Consequently, these studies reveal the link between neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, and aging. The transcription factor NF-kappa-B (NF-κB) is highly expressed in numerous cell types. It serves as the ultimate step in a cascade of signal transduction events initiated by diverse stimuli associated with multiple biological processes, such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumor development, and programmed cell death. In postmortem analysis, researchers discovered increased NF-κB activity in the brain tissue of patients with AD. Immunoreactivity of the p65 protein was detected in degenerative neurons adjacent to SPs and neurons and glial cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can stimulate microglia and induce translocation of NF-κBp65 subunits to the nucleus through a cascaded reaction, thus stimulating the production of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β/6, Cox-2, and TNF-α 62 . Upon activation, NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and modulates the transcription of genes associated with reactive inflammatory responses, thereby exacerbating neuropathological damage 63 . The protein, STAT3, encoded by this gene, is a member of the STAT protein family. Upon stimulation by cytokines and growth factors, receptor-associated kinases phosphorylate members of the STAT family, forming homologous or heterodimers. These dimers then translocate to the nucleus and function as transcriptional activators. Various cytokines and growth factors, such as IFN, EGF, IL-5/6, HGF, LIF, and BMP2, induce phosphorylation of this protein. This protein, as a mediator, regulates the expression of numerous genes in response to cellular stimuli, thereby playing a crucial role in diverse cellular processes. In AD patients, STAT3 is excessively activated in the brain and contributes to the development of neuronal inflammation and neuronal death. TERT functions as the catalytic subunit of telomerase, playing a crucial role in the extension of telomeres and maintenance of genomic integrity 64 . In a study involving mice, researchers demonstrated that the enforced expression of neuronal TERT through crossbreeding with an AD amyloid mouse model resulted in decreased amyloid deposition, suppressed activation of astrocytes and microglia, increased dendritic spines, and improved learning and memory 65 . Moreover, studies indicate that the TERT protein can offer protection against tau-induced oxidative damage and Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis 66 . The PRKCA gene encodes protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and is associated with AD 67 . The PRKCA gene exhibits high expression in key brain regions such as the hippocampus and cortex, which play vital roles in memory and cognitive function. This suggests a significant role for PRKCA in brain function 68 . Secondly, several studies have elucidated a correlation between PRKCA gene polymorphism and a heightened susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 69 . A study determined a substantial correlation between a polymorphism in the PRKCA gene and the susceptibility to developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Moreover, genomic association studies (GWAS) have reported a link between PRKCA and AD. Experimental studies have also indicated a potential connection between PRKCA gene mutation or over-activation and the pathological processes underlying AD. For example, researchers discovered that PRKCA mutations result in abnormal PKCα protein activation, which in turn causes the accumulation of the Aβ precursor protein (APP), the phosphorylation of the Tau protein, and ultimately contributes to the development AD 70 . Aging is a natural process characterized by degenerative changes in human tissues and organs. With advancements in medicine, humans have gained some control over aging. The brain is especially susceptible to the impact of aging, resulting in the emergence of neurodegenerative diseases. The decline of the cerebral nervous system results in altered morphological structure and reduced synaptic connectivity of nerve cells, contributing to increased neuronal apoptosis, brain aging, and neurodegeneration 71 – 73 . Aging is considered the primary risk factor for AD, and it is linked to telomere shortening, which occurs in the terminal region of chromosomes. The activation of somatic cells to produce TERT protein, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length, can ameliorate AD-related symptoms in both mouse models and neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. The TERT gene encodes telomerase’s RNA and protein components, which collectively form the catalytic core of the enzyme. Mutations in the TERT gene reduce telomerase activity, leading to chromosomal instability and aberrant cell proliferation. The TPP1 gene encodes the regulatory subunit of telomerase, which interacts with other subunits to modulate the activity and stability of the enzyme. Mutations in the TPP1 gene reduce telomerase activity, leading to cellular senescence and disease 74 . The DKC1 gene encodes a cofactor of telomerase that facilitates the assembly and proper functioning of the enzyme. Mutations in the DKC1 gene reduce telomerase activity, resulting in cellular senescence and disease 75 . To confirm the relationship between key genes and TPP1 and DKC1, gene correlation analysis was conducted using GEPIA. Key genes and TPP1 and DKC1 were input into the search words in turn, and all brain tissues were selected from GTEx tissues for correlation analysis. The results showed that the key targets for alleviating AD (NF-κB, STAT3, PRKCA) exhibited a significant positive correlation with TPP1 and DKC1 expression (Fig. 12 ). This provides additional evidence that Pholiota adiposa can influence the assembly of the telomerase holoenzyme complex. Fig. 12 Correlation analysis between Pholiota adiposa key targets and TPP1 (A–C). Correlation analysis between Pholiota adiposa key targets and DKC1 (D–F). The study revealed that the anti-AD component found in Pholiota adiposa may reduce the inflammatory response of nerve cells by inhibiting specific protein phosphorylation. Additionally, certain components may influence the metabolic process of the central carbon pathway, impacting protein deposition linked to AD. Second, the five core targets were associated with aging, and STAT3 exhibited a significant correlation with tau lesions and Aβ protein. Finally, the correlation analysis unveiled a significant relationship among TERT, NF-κB, STAT3, PRKCA, and the expression of telomerase-related genes TPP1 and DKC1. These findings indicate that Pholiota adiposa can delay aging, suppress inflammation, and influence the Tau and Aβ protein pathological process, consequently enhancing gene expression in telomerase synthesis. It plays a role in combating AD through various mechanisms. The findings from the acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay revealed that even at lower concentrations, the positive control group, Tacrine, exhibited significant inhibition of AChE activity, validating the robustness of the experimental methodology. While the Pholiota adiposa extract’s inhibitory impact is less potent than that of Tacrine, its natural origin and non-pharmaceutical properties offer potential distinct advantages in the adjunctive therapy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These in vitro results lend support to the hypothesis that Pholiota adiposa could potentially contribute to AD treatment by suppressing AChE activity and impeding acetylcholine degradation. Subsequent research endeavors will delve deeper into its pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action in vivo. During our recent research, numerous valuable bioactive compounds have been discovered in edible and medicinal fungi, which possess diverse beneficial effects on human health. Particularly, Cordycepin has demonstrated efficacy in slowing down neuronal apoptosis, impacting the pathological process of tau, enhancing neurotrophic factor expression, and preserving synaptic function. Meanwhile, Pholiota adiposa displays significant potential in suppressing inflammatory responses in nerve cells, mitigating diverse causative factors of pathological processes, and modulating the expression of telomerase-related genes. Alzheimer’s disease, as a chronic condition, necessitates prolonged treatment. Utilizing bioactive components derived from edible and medicinal fungi shows promise in inhibiting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease with minimal toxicity concerns. Hence, we anticipate the future application of these remarkable ingredients in disease management. Conclusion This study unveils the potential role and molecular mechanisms of Pholiota adiposa in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) treatment through network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis. Pholiota adiposa may regulate key proteins involved in AD’s pathological process, including STAT3, PRKCA, NF-κB1, and CDK1, potentially inhibiting protein phosphorylation, impacting neuronal cell membrane synthesis and RNA polymerase II activity, thereby positively influencing AD progression. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis reveals its potential impact on cancer pathways, demonstrating its versatile role in AD treatment. By employing machine learning techniques, notably LASSO regression and random forest algorithms, we corroborated the significance of STAT3 and NFKB1 as potential targets for AD therapy. Molecular docking studies indicate that Pholiota adiposa ’s active components like carnosol, carnosic acid, and clovane diol exhibit substantial affinity for these targets, particularly carnosol showing promise in enhancing binding with STAT3. The results from acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition experiments provide empirical support for Pholiota adiposa as a supplementary approach in AD treatment. These experiments illustrate that Pholiota adiposa extracts can hinder AChE activity in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting it may ameliorate cognitive function in AD patients by slowing acetylcholine degradation through AChE inhibition. Future research will further explore its pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action in vivo. Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

  "plain_text": "Pholiota adiposa is recognized for its health benefits, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Our study employs network pharmacology and machine learning to uncover its therapeutic potential. We constructed a network of AD-relevant target proteins using databases like TCMSP, CTD, and GeneCards, and performed gene enrichment and functional analysis with DAVID, GO, and KEGG via Hiplot. Targets were identified through Cytoscape’s degree analysis and the Aging Atlas database for aging-related genes. Clinical targets were confirmed with GEO, and molecular docking was executed using AutoDock Vina. LASSO regression and random forest algorithms were applied for target model selection, and molecular dynamics simulations were run with Gromacs2022.3. Our findings suggest Pholiota adiposa modulates key proteins involved in AD, including STAT3, PRKCA, NF-κB1, and CDK1, potentially inhibiting protein phosphorylation and influencing neuronal membrane synthesis and RNA polymerase II activity. KEGG analysis revealed its impact on cancer pathways, indicating a multifaceted role. High-degree targets like STAT3 and NF-κB1 were identified as effective, with TERT showing a significant role in aging. Machine learning confirmed the diagnostic importance of STAT3 and NFKB1 in AD. Molecular docking highlighted the affinity of Pholiota adiposa for these targets, with carnosol, carnosic acid, and clovane diol as key components. Carnosol, in particular, induced a conformational change in STAT3, enhancing its efficacy. Pholiota adiposa shows promise as a therapeutic agent in AD treatment by modulating various pathways and signaling mechanisms, as demonstrated through network pharmacology and machine learning analyses. This study underscores its potential in managing neurodegenerative diseases. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-94861-x."
