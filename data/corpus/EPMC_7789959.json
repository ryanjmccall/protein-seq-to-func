  "abstract_text": "The MXI1 gene encodes a protein interacting with Max, a regulatory factor of the Myc oncogene, and is located on chromosome 10q25, a region showing frequent loss of heterozygosity in malignant gliomas. We have reassessed the coding sequence of MXI1 and found that, at the 3' end, the open reading frame is 28 codons shorter than previously described. We have also found an AAAAC polymorphic repeat (two alleles, 45% heterozygosity) in the 3' non-coding region of the gene. Six anaplastic astrocytomas and nine glioblastomas, the most malignant form of glioma, were informative for this polymorphism. Loss of heterozygosity was demonstrated in all glioblastomas, but not in the remaining tumors.",
