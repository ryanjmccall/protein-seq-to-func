    "abstract_text": "The heterodimeric transcription factor RUNX1/PEBP2-beta (also known as AML1/CBF-beta) is essential for definitive hematopoiesis. Here, we show that interaction with PEBP2-beta leads to the phosphorylation of RUNX1, which in turn induces p300 phosphorylation. This is mediated by homeodomain interacting kinase 2 (HIPK2), targeting Ser(249), Ser(273), and Thr(276) in RUNX1, in a manner that is also dependent on the RUNX1 PY motif. Importantly, we observed the in vitro disruption of this phosphorylation cascade by multiple leukemogenic genetic defects targeting RUNX1/CBFB. In particular, the oncogenic protein PEBP2-beta-SMMHC prevents RUNX1/p300 phosphorylation by sequestering HIPK2 to mislocalized RUNX1/beta-SMMHC complexes. Therefore, phosphorylation of RUNX1 appears a critical step in its association with and phosphorylation of p300, and its disruption may be a common theme in RUNX1-associated leukemogenesis.",
