    "abstract_text": "nfkb2 encodes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100. While p52 functions as a Rel transcription factor, the larger p100 protein acts as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of select NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor complexes. Because of their distinct functions, we have studied the biochemical basis for the production of these two nfkb2-derived gene products. Like the p50 product of the nfkb1 gene, p52 is principally generated in a cotranslational manner involving proteolytic processing by the proteasome. The generation of p52 is dependent on a glycine-rich region (GRR) located upstream of the p52 C-terminus, and repositioning of this GRR alters the location of proteasome processing. In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105. Using p100/p105 chimeras containing different segments of the nfkb1 and nfkb2 genes, we have found that diminished p52 processing is a property conferred by peptide sequences located downstream of the GRR, flanking the site of p52 processing.",
