  "abstract_text": "The variety of human cancers in which the retinoblastoma protein pRb is inactivated reflects both its broad importance for tumor suppression and its multitude of cellular functions. Accumulating evidence indicates that pRb contributes to a diversity of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and genome stability. pRb performs these diverse functions through the formation of large complexes that include E2F transcription factors and chromatin regulators. In this review we will discuss some of the recent advances made in understanding the structure and function of pRb as they relate to tumor suppression, and highlight research using Drosophila melanogaster that reveals important, evolutionarily conserved functions of the RB family.",
