    "abstract_text": "Insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase that acts as a critical mediator of cell proliferation and survival. Inhibitors of this receptor are believed to provide a new target in cancer therapy. We previously reported an isoquinolinedione series of IGF-1R inhibitors. Now we have identified a series of 3-cyanoquinoline compounds that are low nanomolar inhibitors of IGF-1R. The strategies, synthesis, and SAR behind the cyanoquinoline scaffold will be discussed.",
