However, work on the bioethical impact of these images of the future remains incomplete. The academic debate on human germline genetic modification (hereafter HGGM) first emerged in the form of eugenics manifestos, crossing disciplinary lines in the mid\u20101960s as theologians began to challenge scientists\u2019 authority over ethical questions. 1 Almost immediately, scholars acknowledged that metaphors like genetic \u201cengineering,\u201d \u201csurgery,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d or \u201calgeny\u201d could frame the discourse in different ways. 2 However, no authors have examined the potential framing effects of another rhetorical device: the choice of which genetic modifications to give as examples. Whether aimed at scholars or the general public, most bioethical publications on HGGM name at least a few traits that scientists might eventually modify. Authors writing before the establishment of molecular genetics were obviously unable to name the actual sequences they wished to change. Even after the discovery of numerous alleles hyped as \u201cgenes for\u201d particular characteristics, most stakeholders continued to discuss not specific DNA modifications but complex traits\u2014including ones that are deeply influenced by the environment or even socially constructed. The most common of these include beauty, creativity, dementia resistance, eye color, hair color, health, height, immune response, intelligence, longevity, memory, morality, musical talent, new abilities, personality, servility, sex, skin color, and strength. This article examines how the set of traits discussed in the HGGM debate has changed over time. First, it shows how academic authors moved from writing more frequently about moral traits to writing more about cosmetic traits around 1980. The article examines what this shift might tell us about authors\u2019 scholarly, cultural, political, or technological influences, and how it may have implicitly affected their ethical arguments. Finally, it argues that contemporary bioethicists have continued to overlook the ethical issues raised by modifications outside of the typical shortlist. 2 INTELLIGENCE AND MORALITY IN THE EARLY DEBATE The idea of making people smarter and kinder dates back to the very beginning of the eugenics movement. Francis Galton, who coined the word \u201ceugenics\u201d in 1883, wrote that modern man had failed to develop the \u201cwits and goodness\u201d needed to administer a complex civilization. 3 He urged readers to improve the \u201cmental, moral, and physical\u201d nature of their race. 4 Accordingly, eugenics advocates in the early 20th century described the need to make people \u201cphysically, mentally, and morally stronger and healthier\u201d 5 or seek partners who were \u201cperfect physically, mentally, and morally.\u201d 6 Although health was a major concern for eugenicists, especially in the 1930s and onward, they generally prioritized mental traits. 7 One of their primary motivations was the perceived increase of criminality. 8 Charles Davenport, who ran the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor, argued that there was a single gene for violent outbursts. 9 However, the majority of early geneticists came to view allegedly immoral behavior as the downstream consequence of a gene for low intelligence. 10 Henry Goddard, whose views overtook Davenport\u2019s in the 1910s, classified people between \u201cdull normal\u201d and \u201cfeebleminded\u201d based on whether they could tell right from wrong. 11 Although \u201cmainline\u201d eugenics continued into the 1970s and beyond through sterilization programs, 12 this literature did not directly influence discussions of HGGM. Rather, the debate was shaped by \u201creform\u201d eugenics, a breakaway movement that sought to distance genetic improvement from racist and classist pseudoscience. 13 Reform eugenicists thought modern civilization was selecting against intelligence and altruism 14 while preserving harmful mutations in the gene pool. Nobel\u2010winning geneticist H. J. Muller, who would become the most cited figure in the early HGGM debate, 15 labeled this purported health risk the \u201cgenetic load.\u201d 16 In 1939, Nature published a \u201cgeneticist\u2019s manifesto\u201d primarily authored by Muller 17 and signed by many other notable contributors to the early debate, including Julian Huxley, Theodosius Dobzhansky and J. B. S. Haldane. It stated: The most important genetic objectives, from a social point of view, are the improvement of those genetic characteristics which make (a) for health, (b) for the complex called intelligence, and (c) for those temperamental qualities which favour fellow\u2010feeling and social behaviour rather than those (to\u2010day most esteemed by many) which make for personal \u2018success\u2019, as success is usually understood at present. 18 After a lull following World War II and the defeat of Nazi Germany, these scientists began publishing eugenics articles again, circa 1953. 19 Many repeated the same three priorities. 20 In 1955, Bentley Glass suggested all could agree on \u201cfreedom from gross physical or mental defects, sound health, high intelligence, general adaptability, integrity of character, and nobility of spirit.\u201d 21 In 1963, Francis Crick described a consensus supporting \u201cgood health, high intelligence, [and] general benevolence.\u201d 22 This common grouping may reflect a folk ontology in which people consist of \u201cmind, heart and body.\u201d 23 The ability to divide humans into just three broad components is both elegant and rhetorically powerful. Nevertheless, many reform eugenicists continued to prioritize mental improvements. 24 Muller opined in the debut issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics that not health or strength, but \u201cGreater intellectual capacity, and along with it kindlier natural feelings, are surely the greatest biological needs of all humanity.\u201d 25 Although intelligence was the more universally valued of the two, 26 reform eugenicists no longer saw it as the root cause of morality. 27 In fact, Muller thought enhancing intelligence alone could be catastrophic. 28 He ended his involvement in the Repository for Germinal Choice, a defunct sperm bank intended for Nobel Prize winners, when he realized that owner Robert K. Graham valued intelligence far more than altruism. 29 The intellectual environment of the early HGGM debate was especially conducive to discussing moral enhancement because of its emphasis on society as a whole. 30 While living in the USSR in the 1930s, Muller had presented Stalin with his manifesto Out of the night , which argued that reform eugenics was compatible with socialist revolution. 31 Even after his disillusionment, Muller emphasized the need to extend cooperation beyond \u201crace, or nation, or class\u201d to \u201cmankind as a whole\u201d and thus to prevent war. 32 Some of his colleagues even thought that genetic engineering might help prevent nuclear Armageddon. 33 In conference proceedings published the year after the Cuban Missile Crisis, fellow Nobel winner Joshua Lederberg commented that genetic engineering could theoretically forestall World War Three by removing \u201cpersonality problems and emotional disturbances.\u201d 34 Issues like aggression and warfare may have been especially emphasized because, in Lederberg\u2019s words, images from the sixties were \u201coverwhelmingly male\u2010oriented.\u201d 35 Indeed, Muller often described compassion in gendered language such as a \u201cvirile \u2026 comradeliness.\u201d 36 The emphasis on wide\u2010scale HGGM for the public good also extended to the other traits these scientists discussed. Preserving the gene pool from deterioration was not just a way to alleviate individual suffering, but a strategy for rescuing civilization. Even when writing about enhancements, authors often framed traits like intelligence as ways to provide society with better leaders. 37 For instance, Julian Huxley, the brother of Aldous and first director of UNESCO, suggested creating statesmen with a long\u2010term view of politics. 38 Scientists also imagined genetic changes on an extended time frame, agreeing that issues like genetic load would take centuries or longer to correct. 39 Haldane\u2019s last major article on the topic, published in 1963, examined \u201cpossibilities for the human species in the next ten thousand years.\u201d 40 Around the same time, biochemical geneticists began to enter the debate, bringing with them the idea that direct genetic modification might be imminent. 41 Rather than slowly combining promising gametes for statistical benefits to the gene pool, they foresaw technologies that would let eugenics be applied to individual humans. 42 However, the scope of the debate remained wide in the mid\u201060s because theologians were beginning to challenge scientists\u2019 jurisdiction over the ethics of HGGM. 43 While they disagreed about concepts like genetic load, both groups were primarily concerned about society on a broad scale and\u2014with notable exceptions like Methodist ethicist Paul Ramsey\u2014the distant future. 44 As the debate continued into the 1970s, scientists and theologians considered genetic intervention in the context of an increasing range of issues, like chimeras, cloning, sperm banks, abortion, and global pollution. 45 They also contended with the emergence of sociobiology which renewed public interest in the heritability of traits like intelligence, altruism, criminal behavior, and alcoholism. 46 Eric Juengst called the 1970s the \u201cRomantic stage of inquiry\u201d 47 marked by \u201cawe,\u201d 48 while Alexander Capron coined the term \u201cgenicity\u201d to describe the strong emotions and vivid rhetoric stirred by these speculations. 49 Sociologist John H. Evans has described it as the last decade dominated by Weberian \u201csubstantive rationality,\u201d as participants in the HGGM discourse considered incommensurable ends like \u201cspecies perfectionism, beneficence, obeying God, creating meaning for human society, the pursuit of knowledge as an end itself, and many others.\u201d 50 Within this intellectual culture, it seemed natural to mention modifications like moral enhancement. 3 THE MOVE AWAY FROM MORAL ENHANCEMENT Some categories of modification discussed in the HGGM debate are constants, such as therapeutic applications. The most commonly mentioned enhancement over the past hundred years has clearly been intelligence, 51 and many authors have expressed concern about the special attention paid to it by scientists and bioethicists alike. 52 Intelligence manipulation through chemical methods is also featured in Brave new world , by far the most cited work of science fiction in the debate. 53 Although it can be difficult to quantify precisely, interest in other traits has fluctuated more dramatically over the past hundred years. Compared to early writings on HGGM, references to creativity, servility, and animal genes have noticeably fallen, while references to cosmetic appearance, athletic ability, resistance to infectious diseases, and lowered risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease have increased. However, the most significant shift in the discourse is that references to moral enhancement dropped precipitously in the 1980s. Perhaps the most obvious interpretation is that scientists like Muller, Huxley, and Haldane had been unable to attract younger scholars to their ideologies. 54 Eugenics first became \u201ca term of opprobrium\u201d among scientists during the 1960s. 55 In 1966, as the debate was first becoming interdisciplinary, sociologist Kingsley Davis suggested that only stakeholders who had already cemented their reputations still felt safe advocating ambitious eugenic programs; meanwhile, lesser\u2010known authors stuck to moderate proposals like voluntary genetic counseling. 56 This meant that the early HGGM debate was disproportionately influenced by older scientists, with a background in population and statistical genetics, most of whom passed away by the mid\u20101970s. Even during the broadly substantive period of the debate, participants occasionally pointed to aggression and cooperation as the scientific weak points in eugenic proposals. 57 Purported crime\u2010prone \u201csupermales\u201d with XYY chromosomes were mentioned only a handful of times in the debate and mostly dismissed as spurious; 58 Bentley Glass noted that it was not clear that \u201csympathy, empathy, or cooperativeness\u201d were objectively measurable or even hereditary. 59 Over the second half of the 1970s, scientists interested in genetic modification began to turn their attention from the far future toward the immediate risks and benefits of somatic gene therapy. 60 The year 1980 saw the first somatic therapy trials, 61 as well as the first transgenic mice 62 and the first patent on a genetically modified organism. 63 As a result, genetic engineering quickly regained the center of attention over less realistic technologies like cloning. 64 The next step in the debate was largely sparked by the 1982 President\u2019s Commission report Splicing life , which has been described as the most significant publication in the history of the HGGM debate. 65 Rather than drawing on reform eugenics literature, 66 its authors took inspiration from the newer field of research ethics and the recombinant DNA debate. 67 Splicing life explicitly repudiated substantive theological approaches to HGGM, categorizing religious concerns as variants of the \u201cplaying God\u201d argument. 68 The 1982 Congressional hearings on Human Genetic Engineering, chaired by Al Gore and featuring testimony from many of the major contributors to the debate, included only one reference to \u201cemotional, moral sensitivity,\u201d from Catholic theologian Richard McCormick, 69 and one to \u201caggression,\u201d by then\u2010Episcopal priest John C. Fletcher. 70 Even though theological statements on HGGM became frequent in the 1980s, 71 scientists were ceasing to engage with religious authors on deeper questions about society. 72 By the middle of the decade, the most influential opponents of HGGM were not theologians 73 but activists like Jeremy Rifkin, who mobilized clergy as supporters but couched his substantive criticism in non\u2010religious language for the general public. 74 Efforts to improve the compassion of future people would be mentioned in only one notable secular publication on HGGM during the 1980s, Peter Singer and Deane Wells\u2019 The reproduction revolution . 75 New analyses by scientists and by the rapidly growing discipline of bioethics 76 moved from society to individual minds and bodies, 77 viewing procreative liberty as a safeguard against state eugenics 78 and casting doubt on our ability to decide for distant generations. 79 Instead of debating the meaning of existence or projects for world betterment, these authors used a \u201cformal rationality\u201d that targeted their work to the calculations and compromises sought by new government commissions. 80 The adoption of bioethical principlism, outside its original context in human subjects research, had produced an intellectual environment that made it difficult to argue philosophically against HGGM. 81 Starting with W. French Anderson\u2019s 1985 paper \u201cHuman gene therapy: Scientific and ethical considerations,\u201d a consensus began to emerge that HGGM might be permissible if the risk/benefit balance was appropriate and the technology was used only for therapy. 82 It also reconnected the debate to the ethics of reproduction, 83 where the principle of autonomy was especially strong. Genetic counselors had begun placing a high value on nondirectiveness as early as the 1950s, 84 resulting in decades of tension between their original eugenic goal of reducing disease alleles and the goal of following clients\u2019 subjective interests. 85 With the exception of the remaining theologians in the debate, 86 the focus on individual couples\u2019 decisions over global effects or substantive ends would intensify in the 1990s. 87 Many authors adopted a position open to parental choice called \u201cliberal eugenics,\u201d which was piloted by Jonathan Glover\u2019s 1984 book What sort of people should there be and joined in the subsequent decade by authors like John Harris, John Robertson, Philip Kitcher, Lee Silver, and Nicholas Agar. 88 Perhaps the largest new influence was from analytic philosophy, 89 examining questions like numerical identity 90 and distributive justice. Many authors drew on the rival political theories of John Rawls and Robert Nozick, both of whom originally addressed genetic engineering only in footnotes. 91 Rawlsian principles allow inequality in \u201cprimary goods\u201d like health and intelligence only when they make everyone better off, 92 while Nozick\u2019s \u201cgenetic supermarket\u201d would allow parents to choose their offspring\u2019s traits without state interference. 93 However, both theories remain open to HGGM based on individual preference, including enhancement. 94 Indeed, enhancements to physical traits like strength and height were being analyzed within the framework of formal rationality by the mid\u201090s. 95 The first associations between specific genes and personality were published in 1996, 96 making it easier for authors to discuss behavioral HGGM. But since genetic modifications were now being framed as medical procedures, 97 measurable physical enhancements were epistemically favored over traits like altruism that seemed closer to the social sphere of teachers or religious leaders. 98 This trend extended beyond academic discourse to popular media: Celeste Condit found that 43% of articles from the \u201cclassical\u201d eugenics era mentioned moral enhancement, whereas only 14% did so by 1995. 99 The early 2000s would see an upswing in publications with more substantive objections to HGGM based in human nature, including highly cited works by members of George W. Bush\u2019s President\u2019s Council on Bioethics. 100 However, these did not mention morality as frequently as did authors open to enhancement. Like their forerunners, contemporary authors who write about moral enhancement discuss the need to avert large\u2010scale catastrophes. 101 For instance, Persson and Savulescu\u2019s controversial book Unfit for the future suggests using HGGM to contain weapons of mass destruction and environmental degradation. 102 However, these authors now tend to view morality less as a form of reasoning, the way \u201cmainline\u201d eugenicists or Kantians imagined, and more as a separate faculty. 103 They often promote reducing xenophobia and racism, 104 modifications which were never considered even by reform eugenicists. Finally, modern authors tend to focus more on pharmaceutical or neurological methods of moral enhancement than on HGGM. Many give the example of oxytocin, which, starting in the mid\u20102000s, was claimed to make people more generous, more trusting, and better at reading others\u2019 emotional states. 105 Gene\u2010based moral enhancement remains a common topic of discussion, 106 but between changing disciplinary involvement and an increasing focus on the preferences of individual parents, it no longer occupies a central position in the HGGM debate. Among major statements published since the development of CRISPR, only the 2017 U.S. National Academies report mentions using the technology to improve morality. 107 In order to examine the kinds of images being used in public engagement, I also performed a study that examined every survey of public opinion on HGGM over the same time period. Not one included a question about moral enhancement, but eight asked about appearance. 108 Indeed, the third most frequently mentioned type of HGGM in the debate, after therapeutic uses and intelligence enhancement, currently seems to be modifications to cosmetic traits. References to beauty, eye color, and hair color, as well as related traits like stature and musculature, 109 have risen steadily in works by academic authors while references to moral enhancement declined. 4 THE MOVE TOWARD COSMETIC MODIFICATION Although physical attractiveness was not a primary concern in American eugenics, 110 many eugenicists did take an interest in cosmetic traits. Galton himself travelled around England using a hidden score card to tally the attractiveness of women in different cities, 111 and Charles Davenport published pioneering papers on the inheritance of eye and hair color. 112 Most infamously, Nazi eugenics elevated \u201cAryan\u201d features into an aesthetic ideal that continues to resonate in popular culture. 113 Perhaps, as a result, these kinds of traits were mentioned less frequently by scientists during the early HGGM debate. 114 It is fairly easy to see why some traits were increasingly discussed over the following decades: references to athletic enhancement presumably take partial inspiration from doping scandals, height from the use of human growth hormone, dementia from the discovery of the risk\u2010raising APOE4 allele, and resistance to infectious diseases from variants like CCR5\u039432 . 115 While it is possible that bioethicists were responding to the normalization of plastic surgery, 116 there was no specific gene or medication to discover for aesthetic appeal. Moreover, purely cosmetic traits like eye color have been used as textbook examples of genetic traits for decades despite remaining imperfectly understood on the molecular level. 117 The turn toward these kinds of modifications in the HGGM debate may have come not in response to new scientific developments, but indirectly through the world of business. During the 1980s, as the burgeoning biotechnology industry became increasingly responsible for research funding, 118 scientists and other stakeholders developed a more commercial and capitalistic understanding of how HGGM might be used. Rather than a collective responsibility, DNA itself was conceptualized as a material resource. 119 At the same time, scholars were presented with a readymade model of commoditized reproduction. The first commercial sperm bank opened in Minneapolis in 1970. 120 Although sperm freezing had been possible for decades, this was the first time that it had been distributed through a company rather than within the doctor\u2010patient relationship. By the end of the decade, the three most important sperm banks had all opened in California, and frozen sperm would supplant \u201cfresh\u201d stocks entirely with the advent of the AIDS crisis. 121 As a result, authors in the HGGM debate may have found it more relevant to allude to the kind of aesthetic choices that parents were making in the real world, such as selecting sperm donors with a particular skin tone, hair color, eye color, and height. 122 Most physicians also expressed willingness to select sperm based on IQ and education. 123 Ironically, the aesthetic focus of the fertility industry developed indirectly from Muller\u2019s plans for the betterment of society. Robert K. Graham, his one\u2010time partner in the Repository for Germinal Choice, was an old\u2010school eugenicist, but he noticed a pattern in his clients\u2019 questions. As journalist David Plotz observed, \u201cSure, sometimes his applicants asked how smart a donor was. But they usually asked how good\u2010looking he was. And they always asked how tall he was. Nobody, Graham saw, ever chose the \u2018short sperm\u2019.\u201d 124 By sending recruiters to gather donations from physically attractive men, and listing them in an ad\u2010like catalog, Graham turned the Repository into a model for the rest of the industry. 125 These preferences were likely carried over into the HGGM debate as it looked increasingly to the wishes of individual couples. Other new reproductive technologies were also gaining attention in the early 1980s. IVF was becoming widely accepted, 126 surrogacy was making headlines, 127 and physicians had become increasingly open to sex selection. 128 Indeed, the number of American geneticists willing to diagnose or refer patients for sex\u2010selective abortions rose from 1% as of Roe v. Wade to 62% by 1989. 129 Like eye and hair color, sex selection was often considered a psychological slippery slope to other discretionary uses of genetics. 130 In contrast with the emphasis on genetically modified men in the early debate, sex selection also foregrounds the possibility of female designer babies, and the idea of using reproductive technologies for beauty, complexion, and coloring plays into common stereotypes of femininity. 131 Finally, the phrase \u201cdesigner baby,\u201d which entered popular culture in the 1980s, 132 may have reinforced the idea of parents choosing aesthetically fashionable traits for their children. 133 5 CONSEQUENCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOETHICAL ARGUMENTS The decrease in references to moral enhancement and increase in references to cosmetic modification do not mean that authors came to value the latter more, or even that they found it more ethically intriguing. No papers or books have been devoted specifically to the ethics of genetically modifying babies\u2019 eye or hair color, as there have been for other increasingly mentioned traits like athletic enhancement. 134 Authors who discuss potential uses of HGGM have simply begun to include cosmetic modifications more frequently in their work, even if they are simply reciting them in a list. One way to explain this is a shared schema: an \u201cabstract knowledge structure\u201d of the relationships between different concepts that helps us store, retrieve, and fill gaps in our information. 135 Schemas can include stereotypes like nerd, jock, or untrustworthy politician. 136 They guide our expectations of which categories should be associated with which traits and vice versa. Since schemas are based on experience, and there were no genetically modified people until very recently, expectations about their traits had to come from other exposures, 137 such as the work of previous authors, genetics research, associations with other reproductive technologies, or even science fiction tropes. The literature on HGGM suggests that stakeholders prior to the 1980s associated the category of genetically modified people most strongly with the traits of health, intelligence, and morality\u2014and often with maleness\u2014whereas recent scholars have a slightly different schema that includes more physical modifications. This is not to suggest that other components of the schema remained identical; while intelligence has remained the paradigmatic example of genetic enhancement, specific images associated with it have changed over time. Participants in the early debate often agreed that humans would need to be intellectually upgraded to meet the increasing complexity of modern civilization 138 or to perform research into greater and greater enhancements. 139 As the debate narrowed, most authors began to focus on more conventional desires like success in education and career. However, the shift of cosmetic modification into the central schema and moral enhancement out of it has likely had deeper effects on the bioethical conversation. This process has encouraged the development of different kinds of arguments about HGGM, and it also suggests different images of the technology\u2019s future social context. In several important ways, moral enhancement and cosmetic modification are similar: from a Rawlsian perspective, neither are usually viewed as primary goods that parents might be expected to guarantee for their children in a neutral state. 140 While viewed as enhancements by some authors and not by others, both are also agreed not to be therapeutic. 141 Yet moral and cosmetic modifications are associated with mostly different ethical issues. Setting aside general objections like unequal access, the former raises fears of easy exploitation, restricted freedom, circumventing character development, political stagnation, loss of behavioral diversity, prejudice against the unenhanced, and the enforcement of a single view of morality. 142 Fewer authors have specifically discussed attractiveness, but they point out issues such as cultural, racial, and gendered beauty standards, loss of physical diversity, envy, and simply being a waste of money. 143 As a result of these concerns, stakeholders tend to view cosmetic modifications much more negatively than moral enhancements. Proponents of moral enhancement have generally considered it a contribution to human flourishing, despite occasionally praising the role of aggression in political change or resistance to dictatorships. 144 But while making someone more compassionate or less aggressive is typically presented as a benefit to those around them, modifications to appearance and other physical traits are usually seen as benefits to nobody or as \u201cpositional goods\u201d that make the modified person\u2019s peers worse off. 145 Moreover, since aesthetic changes are more likely to reflect parents\u2019 individual tastes, they may not even be considered attractive in other cultures. Cosmetic applications have routinely been the least popular use of HGGM in polls of the general public, 146 who criticize them as superficial. 147 Although some authors remain open to cosmetic modifications, most of these have merely tolerated them on the basis of reproductive liberty. 148 Only a handful directly endorse aesthetic enhancement through HGGM: Francesca Minerva has suggested that it might reduce social discrimination against people with unattractive face shapes, 149 while James Watson more vulgarly remarked that making \u201call girls pretty\u201d would be \u201cgreat.\u201d 150 Thus, it seems that cosmetic references joined the central schema while being actively encouraged by only a small minority of stakeholders. The strongly negative valence of cosmetic modification could create a starker contrast between different categories of HGGM, giving authors a stronger example of misuse against which to define therapeutic applications. 151 Perhaps the 1980s\u2019 ethical realignment from the germline/somatic distinction to the therapy/enhancement one was successful partly because enhancements were seen negatively as personal preferences rather than positively as helpful improvements to morality. Another ethical corollary of the move toward bodily changes like cosmetic appearance, athletic ability and disease resistance involves the commonly discussed \u201cnonidentity problem.\u201d First posed by Derek Parfit, it asks whether it could be wrong to have a child with some impairment if avoiding that impairment would mean creating a different child altogether. 152 Emotional characteristics tend to be more closely associated with human nature, 153 and psychology studies find that people usually see changes to morality as the most likely to affect personal identity. 154 In contrast, the most common example of cosmetic HGGM in recent writings is eye color, which has been cited in numerous philosophy papers as precisely the kind of shallow change that would make no difference to a future person\u2019s identity. 155 As LeRoy Walters and Julie Palmer wrote, physical enhancements \u201cmay seem to be less threatening to the essence or central core of a human being.\u201d 156 Besides their direct implications for the identity of genetically modified people, these intuitions could influence some stakeholders\u2019 perceptions about the physical and social risks of different types of HGGM. The third major way in which this shift may have affected the bioethical debate is through its implications for the imagined context of HGGM. Moral enhancement is generally agreed to be a more distant prospect 157 than better\u2010characterized physical changes. As such, the move away from more \u201cscience fictional\u201d plans toward choices similar to those made in the existing fertility industry suggests that HGGM should be considered as part of contemporary society. On the one hand, this draws necessary attention toward the existing social structures and parental motivations associated with assisted reproductive technologies. On the other, this tendency could make authors less willing to consider HGGM in the context of broader social, cultural, or technological changes, or to anticipate issues as distant as species divergence. For instance, cosmetic modification may reinforce the idea of HGGM as a market good within liberal democracy. Authors advocating moral enhancement have often imagined that the government would facilitate it, but cosmetic modifications are likely to be excluded from healthcare funding. 158 Most recent writings assume they would be permitted by a laissez\u2010faire government or that the state would only intervene to protect citizens against unethical uses of HGGM. 159 Authors writing after the switch from moral to cosmetic modification also focus less on civilization as a whole and more on jurisdictional conflicts between existing nation\u2010states, such as reproductive tourism. 160 Finally, cosmetic images of HGGM suggest that its purchasers might be white. Except for the cover of a 2015 report by the Center for Genetics and Society, 161 illustrations of genetically modified babies are almost universally light\u2010skinned. While reform eugenics implicitly took the white middle class as its audience, 162 this racial imagery for HGGM may have continued through the influence of the fertility industry. From the outset, assisted reproductive technology was accessed most frequently by middle\u2010class white couples, with more white specialists to consult and more white gametes available. 163 Graham\u2019s influential Repository never successfully recruited any Black or Asian donors, nor did any Black women ever apply for sperm. 164 These trends may have inadvertently reinforced the image of the designer baby as a Caucasian, for whom the choice between many different hair and eye colors would not be out of place. The common example of parents choosing blond hair and blue eyes 165 even evokes white supremacist uses of HGGM. Beyond restricting the imagined time frame of the debate, the move towards cosmetic images of HGGM may also suggest that it will take place for well\u2010off white couples in Western democracies, although it has yet to be seen whether the 2018 He Jiankui affair in China will affect future representations of the technology. 6 CONTINGENCY AND THE PROBLEM OF UNDEREXPLORED TRAITS Acknowledging our shifting mental images of genetically modified people in previous decades leaves us with the question of how those images might continue to change in the future. The idea that people at different points in history might value different genetic traits is a long\u2010running ethical concern in HGGM. At a practical level, genetic modifications that seem beneficial today could hinder our descendants in a changing environment. 166 HGGM might also obstruct societal change by cementing the arbitrary preferences of a particular generation. 167 John Mackie commented that Victorians might have chosen to design \u201cpatriotic and pious\u201d children, 168 while Paul Root Wolpe facetiously asked, \u201cWomen in the early twentieth century were supposed to be delicate and to faint at the sight of blood; why not select for those desirable traits?\u201d 169 But if these schemas can change over time, then we may not simply value traits differently from other generations; in fact, we may not even bring the same traits to mind in the first place. 170 Opponents of HGGM often quote C. S. Lewis\u2019 1943 essay \u201cThe abolition of man,\u201d which argues that the power to \u201ccondition\u201d future generations would mean putting them in thrall to whichever random confluence of \u201cheredity, digestion, the weather, and the association of ideas\u201d influenced the original conditioners\u2019 plans. 171 Given the shifting pattern of influences discussed in this article, it is easy to see how some plausible uses of HGGM might have been excluded from the debate simply based on historical chance. One indication of this arbitrariness is that the range of characteristics seen as genetic has changed dramatically over time. Although mainline eugenicists focused on a shortlist of important traits, 172 they also attempted to establish Mendelian inheritance patterns for a vast catalog of characteristics. Many of these were obviously rooted in social norms: a frequently mocked example is thalassophilia, the inclination to sail around the world. 173 Charles Davenport\u2019s Individual Analysis Cards also covered traits like daydreaming, patriotism, and ability to take a joke. 174 Scientific advances around the time of World War II, such as Beadle and Tatum\u2019s discovery of the link between genes and enzymes, temporarily shifted geneticists\u2019 focus to medical conditions whose etiology could be clearly demonstrated. 175 Yet, starting in the 1990s, many of the behavioral traits first investigated during the eugenics era began to receive renewed media coverage due to the discovery of purported candidate genes. 176 Examples like perfect pitch began to appear regularly in the HGGM debate, but most of these traits did not. 177 The content of contemporary discussions has clearly been influenced by scientific discoveries, but the modifications we think of do not correspond directly to what we know about the human genome. There is no clear philosophical reason for why authors frequently write about creating mathematical or musical prodigies 178 while avoiding traits like anorexia, income level, political affiliation, promiscuity, PTSD, risk taking, and smoking, all of which have been examined in genome\u2010wide association studies or marketed to the public in direct\u2010to\u2010consumer tests. 179 Scholars who do mention modifications outside of the typical shortlist often do so while imagining the consequences of overlooking those traits in future people. Jonathan Glover, who helped to rehabilitate some of Muller\u2019s work in the 1990s, 180 thought \u201cone of the worst imaginable\u201d outcomes of HGGM would be leaving out \u201cwarmth\u201d or a sense of humor. 181 Anderson questioned whether we might inadvertently destroy our capacity for spirituality, 182 a topic which once interested eugenicists 183 and was central to the breeding experiment in John Humphrey Noyes\u2019 Oneida Community. 184 Many other examples that appear only rarely in the discourse are physical, including blood type 185 and low odor production. 186 Some involve provocative new powers, like built\u2010in biosensors, 187 ability to eat cellulose 188 or glowing in the dark. 189 Some are gendered, like menopause, 190 breast size, 191 or ability to achieve orgasm. 192 A few are associated with race, like epicanthal folds, 193 hair texture (common in advertisements for donor gametes) 194 and removal of the allele for \u201cAsian flush,\u201d which has appeared in journalistic coverage of preimplantation genetic diagnosis 195 but not in the HGGM debate. Finally, it is striking how often scholars discuss height compared to weight, given the latter\u2019s prominent role in social perceptions and the fact that weight maintenance is the second\u2010most investigated trait in twin studies. 196 In comparison to the move from moral to cosmetic modification, it is not clear why most of these traits have been comparatively neglected. Many raise unique and interesting bioethical issues that could represent an important opportunity for future research. 7 CONCLUSION When speculating about the ethics of HGGM, scholars have discussed only a limited set of potential modifications. This list is not intrinsic to human psychology or Western culture but reflects several interlinked historical influences. Prior to the 1980s, the HGGM debate was largely shaped by reform eugenicists and theologians, many of whom used a long\u2010term, societal perspective that favored enhancements to social behavior. As they lost their jurisdiction to molecular geneticists and bioethicists, the discussion became increasingly restricted to the preferences of individual families. Stakeholders who considered HGGM from the context of reproductive autonomy found it easy to discuss traits from the burgeoning commercial fertility industry, like height or coloring, without considering deeper changes to identity or long\u2010term developments in society. Knowing that the kinds of modifications we discuss can change over time could help us to put old and new arguments into better context, by understanding how stakeholders with different knowledge bases imagined abstract categories like enhancement or how they pictured potential users of HGGM. It also presents new opportunities for bioethical analysis. Considering past influences on the set of traits that authors imagined changing with HGGM may enable us to anticipate future developments in the debate through greater attention to jurisdictional conflicts between disciplines, preferences in donor gamete use, and large\u2010scale societal transformations. For instance, Francoise Baylis concluded her recent book by speculating that climate change might result in increasing attention to collective benefit in the HGGM debate. 197 We also need to decide which traits to prioritize in continuning discussions of HGGM. Should we start by considering precedent in the bioethics literature, perceived feasibility, potential impact on human life, level of public demand, or perceived ethical complexity? As CRISPR and related technologies continue to develop, a broad and proactive conversation about which modifications we discuss could help us respond to a more diverse range of bioethical issues than we are currently equipped to face.

Bioethics , 36 , 556 \u2013 568 . 10.1111/bioe.12913 34218455 1 INTRODUCTION Scientists and other stakeholders began to discuss the prospect of genetically modifying human embryos and gametes many decades before the development of CRISPR technology. However, work on the bioethical impact of these images of the future remains incomplete. The academic debate on human germline genetic modification (hereafter HGGM) first emerged in the form of eugenics manifestos, crossing disciplinary lines in the mid\u20101960s as theologians began to challenge scientists\u2019 authority over ethical questions. 1 Almost immediately, scholars acknowledged that metaphors like genetic \u201cengineering,\u201d \u201csurgery,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d or \u201calgeny\u201d could frame the discourse in different ways. 2 However, no authors have examined the potential framing effects of another rhetorical device: the choice of which genetic modifications to give as examples. Whether aimed at scholars or the general public, most bioethical publications on HGGM name at least a few traits that scientists might eventually modify. Authors writing before the establishment of molecular genetics were obviously unable to name the actual sequences they wished to change. Even after the discovery of numerous alleles hyped as \u201cgenes for\u201d particular characteristics, most stakeholders continued to discuss not specific DNA modifications but complex traits\u2014including ones that are deeply influenced by the environment or even socially constructed. The most common of these include beauty, creativity, dementia resistance, eye color, hair color, health, height, immune response, intelligence, longevity, memory, morality, musical talent, new abilities, personality, servility, sex, skin color, and strength. This article examines how the set of traits discussed in the HGGM debate has changed over time. First, it shows how academic authors moved from writing more frequently about moral traits to writing more about cosmetic traits around 1980. The article examines what this shift might tell us about authors\u2019 scholarly, cultural, political, or technological influences, and how it may have implicitly affected their ethical arguments. Finally, it argues that contemporary bioethicists have continued to overlook the ethical issues raised by modifications outside of the typical shortlist. 2 INTELLIGENCE AND MORALITY IN THE EARLY DEBATE The idea of making people smarter and kinder dates back to the very beginning of the eugenics movement. Francis Galton, who coined the word \u201ceugenics\u201d in 1883, wrote that modern man had failed to develop the \u201cwits and goodness\u201d needed to administer a complex civilization. 3 He urged readers to improve the \u201cmental, moral, and physical\u201d nature of their race. 4 Accordingly, eugenics advocates in the early 20th century described the need to make people \u201cphysically, mentally, and morally stronger and healthier\u201d 5 or seek partners who were \u201cperfect physically, mentally, and morally.\u201d 6 Although health was a major concern for eugenicists, especially in the 1930s and onward, they generally prioritized mental traits. 7 One of their primary motivations was the perceived increase of criminality. 8 Charles Davenport, who ran the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor, argued that there was a single gene for violent outbursts. 9 However, the majority of early geneticists came to view allegedly immoral behavior as the downstream consequence of a gene for low intelligence. 10 Henry Goddard, whose views overtook Davenport\u2019s in the 1910s, classified people between \u201cdull normal\u201d and \u201cfeebleminded\u201d based on whether they could tell right from wrong. 11 Although \u201cmainline\u201d eugenics continued into the 1970s and beyond through sterilization programs, 12 this literature did not directly influence discussions of HGGM. Rather, the debate was shaped by \u201creform\u201d eugenics, a breakaway movement that sought to distance genetic improvement from racist and classist pseudoscience. 13 Reform eugenicists thought modern civilization was selecting against intelligence and altruism 14 while preserving harmful mutations in the gene pool. Nobel\u2010winning geneticist H. J. Muller, who would become the most cited figure in the early HGGM debate, 15 labeled this purported health risk the \u201cgenetic load.\u201d 16 In 1939, Nature published a \u201cgeneticist\u2019s manifesto\u201d primarily authored by Muller 17 and signed by many other notable contributors to the early debate, including Julian Huxley, Theodosius Dobzhansky and J. B. S. Haldane. It stated: The most important genetic objectives, from a social point of view, are the improvement of those genetic characteristics which make (a) for health, (b) for the complex called intelligence, and (c) for those temperamental qualities which favour fellow\u2010feeling and social behaviour rather than those (to\u2010day most esteemed by many) which make for personal \u2018success\u2019, as success is usually understood at present. 18 After a lull following World War II and the defeat of Nazi Germany, these scientists began publishing eugenics articles again, circa 1953. 19 Many repeated the same three priorities. 20 In 1955, Bentley Glass suggested all could agree on \u201cfreedom from gross physical or mental defects, sound health, high intelligence, general adaptability, integrity of character, and nobility of spirit.\u201d 21 In 1963, Francis Crick described a consensus supporting \u201cgood health, high intelligence, [and] general benevolence.\u201d 22 This common grouping may reflect a folk ontology in which people consist of \u201cmind, heart and body.\u201d 23 The ability to divide humans into just three broad components is both elegant and rhetorically powerful. Nevertheless, many reform eugenicists continued to prioritize mental improvements. 24 Muller opined in the debut issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics that not health or strength, but \u201cGreater intellectual capacity, and along with it kindlier natural feelings, are surely the greatest biological needs of all humanity.\u201d 25 Although intelligence was the more universally valued of the two, 26 reform eugenicists no longer saw it as the root cause of morality. 27 In fact, Muller thought enhancing intelligence alone could be catastrophic. 28 He ended his involvement in the Repository for Germinal Choice, a defunct sperm bank intended for Nobel Prize winners, when he realized that owner Robert K. Graham valued intelligence far more than altruism. 29 The intellectual environment of the early HGGM debate was especially conducive to discussing moral enhancement because of its emphasis on society as a whole. 30 While living in the USSR in the 1930s, Muller had presented Stalin with his manifesto Out of the night , which argued that reform eugenics was compatible with socialist revolution. 31 Even after his disillusionment, Muller emphasized the need to extend cooperation beyond \u201crace, or nation, or class\u201d to \u201cmankind as a whole\u201d and thus to prevent war. 32 Some of his colleagues even thought that genetic engineering might help prevent nuclear Armageddon. 33 In conference proceedings published the year after the Cuban Missile Crisis, fellow Nobel winner Joshua Lederberg commented that genetic engineering could theoretically forestall World War Three by removing \u201cpersonality problems and emotional disturbances.\u201d 34 Issues like aggression and warfare may have been especially emphasized because, in Lederberg\u2019s words, images from the sixties were \u201coverwhelmingly male\u2010oriented.\u201d 35 Indeed, Muller often described compassion in gendered language such as a \u201cvirile \u2026 comradeliness.\u201d 36 The emphasis on wide\u2010scale HGGM for the public good also extended to the other traits these scientists discussed. Preserving the gene pool from deterioration was not just a way to alleviate individual suffering, but a strategy for rescuing civilization. Even when writing about enhancements, authors often framed traits like intelligence as ways to provide society with better leaders. 37 For instance, Julian Huxley, the brother of Aldous and first director of UNESCO, suggested creating statesmen with a long\u2010term view of politics. 38 Scientists also imagined genetic changes on an extended time frame, agreeing that issues like genetic load would take centuries or longer to correct. 39 Haldane\u2019s last major article on the topic, published in 1963, examined \u201cpossibilities for the human species in the next ten thousand years.\u201d 40 Around the same time, biochemical geneticists began to enter the debate, bringing with them the idea that direct genetic modification might be imminent. 41 Rather than slowly combining promising gametes for statistical benefits to the gene pool, they foresaw technologies that would let eugenics be applied to individual humans. 42 However, the scope of the debate remained wide in the mid\u201060s because theologians were beginning to challenge scientists\u2019 jurisdiction over the ethics of HGGM. 43 While they disagreed about concepts like genetic load, both groups were primarily concerned about society on a broad scale and\u2014with notable exceptions like Methodist ethicist Paul Ramsey\u2014the distant future. 44 As the debate continued into the 1970s, scientists and theologians considered genetic intervention in the context of an increasing range of issues, like chimeras, cloning, sperm banks, abortion, and global pollution. 45 They also contended with the emergence of sociobiology which renewed public interest in the heritability of traits like intelligence, altruism, criminal behavior, and alcoholism. 46 Eric Juengst called the 1970s the \u201cRomantic stage of inquiry\u201d 47 marked by \u201cawe,\u201d 48 while Alexander Capron coined the term \u201cgenicity\u201d to describe the strong emotions and vivid rhetoric stirred by these speculations. 49 Sociologist John H. Evans has described it as the last decade dominated by Weberian \u201csubstantive rationality,\u201d as participants in the HGGM discourse considered incommensurable ends like \u201cspecies perfectionism, beneficence, obeying God, creating meaning for human society, the pursuit of knowledge as an end itself, and many others.\u201d 50 Within this intellectual culture, it seemed natural to mention modifications like moral enhancement. 3 THE MOVE AWAY FROM MORAL ENHANCEMENT Some categories of modification discussed in the HGGM debate are constants, such as therapeutic applications. The most commonly mentioned enhancement over the past hundred years has clearly been intelligence, 51 and many authors have expressed concern about the special attention paid to it by scientists and bioethicists alike. 52 Intelligence manipulation through chemical methods is also featured in Brave new world , by far the most cited work of science fiction in the debate. 53 Although it can be difficult to quantify precisely, interest in other traits has fluctuated more dramatically over the past hundred years. Compared to early writings on HGGM, references to creativity, servility, and animal genes have noticeably fallen, while references to cosmetic appearance, athletic ability, resistance to infectious diseases, and lowered risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease have increased. However, the most significant shift in the discourse is that references to moral enhancement dropped precipitously in the 1980s. Perhaps the most obvious interpretation is that scientists like Muller, Huxley, and Haldane had been unable to attract younger scholars to their ideologies. 54 Eugenics first became \u201ca term of opprobrium\u201d among scientists during the 1960s. 55 In 1966, as the debate was first becoming interdisciplinary, sociologist Kingsley Davis suggested that only stakeholders who had already cemented their reputations still felt safe advocating ambitious eugenic programs; meanwhile, lesser\u2010known authors stuck to moderate proposals like voluntary genetic counseling. 56 This meant that the early HGGM debate was disproportionately influenced by older scientists, with a background in population and statistical genetics, most of whom passed away by the mid\u20101970s. Even during the broadly substantive period of the debate, participants occasionally pointed to aggression and cooperation as the scientific weak points in eugenic proposals. 57 Purported crime\u2010prone \u201csupermales\u201d with XYY chromosomes were mentioned only a handful of times in the debate and mostly dismissed as spurious; 58 Bentley Glass noted that it was not clear that \u201csympathy, empathy, or cooperativeness\u201d were objectively measurable or even hereditary. 59 Over the second half of the 1970s, scientists interested in genetic modification began to turn their attention from the far future toward the immediate risks and benefits of somatic gene therapy. 60 The year 1980 saw the first somatic therapy trials, 61 as well as the first transgenic mice 62 and the first patent on a genetically modified organism. 63 As a result, genetic engineering quickly regained the center of attention over less realistic technologies like cloning. 64 The next step in the debate was largely sparked by the 1982 President\u2019s Commission report Splicing life , which has been described as the most significant publication in the history of the HGGM debate. 65 Rather than drawing on reform eugenics literature, 66 its authors took inspiration from the newer field of research ethics and the recombinant DNA debate. 67 Splicing life explicitly repudiated substantive theological approaches to HGGM, categorizing religious concerns as variants of the \u201cplaying God\u201d argument. 68 The 1982 Congressional hearings on Human Genetic Engineering, chaired by Al Gore and featuring testimony from many of the major contributors to the debate, included only one reference to \u201cemotional, moral sensitivity,\u201d from Catholic theologian Richard McCormick, 69 and one to \u201caggression,\u201d by then\u2010Episcopal priest John C. Fletcher. 70 Even though theological statements on HGGM became frequent in the 1980s, 71 scientists were ceasing to engage with religious authors on deeper questions about society. 72 By the middle of the decade, the most influential opponents of HGGM were not theologians 73 but activists like Jeremy Rifkin, who mobilized clergy as supporters but couched his substantive criticism in non\u2010religious language for the general public. 74 Efforts to improve the compassion of future people would be mentioned in only one notable secular publication on HGGM during the 1980s, Peter Singer and Deane Wells\u2019 The reproduction revolution . 75 New analyses by scientists and by the rapidly growing discipline of bioethics 76 moved from society to individual minds and bodies, 77 viewing procreative liberty as a safeguard against state eugenics 78 and casting doubt on our ability to decide for distant generations. 79 Instead of debating the meaning of existence or projects for world betterment, these authors used a \u201cformal rationality\u201d that targeted their work to the calculations and compromises sought by new government commissions. 80 The adoption of bioethical principlism, outside its original context in human subjects research, had produced an intellectual environment that made it difficult to argue philosophically against HGGM. 81 Starting with W. French Anderson\u2019s 1985 paper \u201cHuman gene therapy: Scientific and ethical considerations,\u201d a consensus began to emerge that HGGM might be permissible if the risk/benefit balance was appropriate and the technology was used only for therapy. 82 It also reconnected the debate to the ethics of reproduction, 83 where the principle of autonomy was especially strong. Genetic counselors had begun placing a high value on nondirectiveness as early as the 1950s, 84 resulting in decades of tension between their original eugenic goal of reducing disease alleles and the goal of following clients\u2019 subjective interests. 85 With the exception of the remaining theologians in the debate, 86 the focus on individual couples\u2019 decisions over global effects or substantive ends would intensify in the 1990s. 87 Many authors adopted a position open to parental choice called \u201cliberal eugenics,\u201d which was piloted by Jonathan Glover\u2019s 1984 book What sort of people should there be and joined in the subsequent decade by authors like John Harris, John Robertson, Philip Kitcher, Lee Silver, and Nicholas Agar. 88 Perhaps the largest new influence was from analytic philosophy, 89 examining questions like numerical identity 90 and distributive justice. Many authors drew on the rival political theories of John Rawls and Robert Nozick, both of whom originally addressed genetic engineering only in footnotes. 91 Rawlsian principles allow inequality in \u201cprimary goods\u201d like health and intelligence only when they make everyone better off, 92 while Nozick\u2019s \u201cgenetic supermarket\u201d would allow parents to choose their offspring\u2019s traits without state interference. 93 However, both theories remain open to HGGM based on individual preference, including enhancement. 94 Indeed, enhancements to physical traits like strength and height were being analyzed within the framework of formal rationality by the mid\u201090s. 95 The first associations between specific genes and personality were published in 1996, 96 making it easier for authors to discuss behavioral HGGM. But since genetic modifications were now being framed as medical procedures, 97 measurable physical enhancements were epistemically favored over traits like altruism that seemed closer to the social sphere of teachers or religious leaders. 98 This trend extended beyond academic discourse to popular media: Celeste Condit found that 43% of articles from the \u201cclassical\u201d eugenics era mentioned moral enhancement, whereas only 14% did so by 1995. 99 The early 2000s would see an upswing in publications with more substantive objections to HGGM based in human nature, including highly cited works by members of George W. Bush\u2019s President\u2019s Council on Bioethics. 100 However, these did not mention morality as frequently as did authors open to enhancement. Like their forerunners, contemporary authors who write about moral enhancement discuss the need to avert large\u2010scale catastrophes. 101 For instance, Persson and Savulescu\u2019s controversial book Unfit for the future suggests using HGGM to contain weapons of mass destruction and environmental degradation. 102 However, these authors now tend to view morality less as a form of reasoning, the way \u201cmainline\u201d eugenicists or Kantians imagined, and more as a separate faculty. 103 They often promote reducing xenophobia and racism, 104 modifications which were never considered even by reform eugenicists. Finally, modern authors tend to focus more on pharmaceutical or neurological methods of moral enhancement than on HGGM. Many give the example of oxytocin, which, starting in the mid\u20102000s, was claimed to make people more generous, more trusting, and better at reading others\u2019 emotional states. 105 Gene\u2010based moral enhancement remains a common topic of discussion, 106 but between changing disciplinary involvement and an increasing focus on the preferences of individual parents, it no longer occupies a central position in the HGGM debate. Among major statements published since the development of CRISPR, only the 2017 U.S. National Academies report mentions using the technology to improve morality. 107 In order to examine the kinds of images being used in public engagement, I also performed a study that examined every survey of public opinion on HGGM over the same time period. Not one included a question about moral enhancement, but eight asked about appearance. 108 Indeed, the third most frequently mentioned type of HGGM in the debate, after therapeutic uses and intelligence enhancement, currently seems to be modifications to cosmetic traits. References to beauty, eye color, and hair color, as well as related traits like stature and musculature, 109 have risen steadily in works by academic authors while references to moral enhancement declined. 4 THE MOVE TOWARD COSMETIC MODIFICATION Although physical attractiveness was not a primary concern in American eugenics, 110 many eugenicists did take an interest in cosmetic traits. Galton himself travelled around England using a hidden score card to tally the attractiveness of women in different cities, 111 and Charles Davenport published pioneering papers on the inheritance of eye and hair color. 112 Most infamously, Nazi eugenics elevated \u201cAryan\u201d features into an aesthetic ideal that continues to resonate in popular culture. 113 Perhaps, as a result, these kinds of traits were mentioned less frequently by scientists during the early HGGM debate. 114 It is fairly easy to see why some traits were increasingly discussed over the following decades: references to athletic enhancement presumably take partial inspiration from doping scandals, height from the use of human growth hormone, dementia from the discovery of the risk\u2010raising APOE4 allele, and resistance to infectious diseases from variants like CCR5\u039432 . 115 While it is possible that bioethicists were responding to the normalization of plastic surgery, 116 there was no specific gene or medication to discover for aesthetic appeal. Moreover, purely cosmetic traits like eye color have been used as textbook examples of genetic traits for decades despite remaining imperfectly understood on the molecular level. 117 The turn toward these kinds of modifications in the HGGM debate may have come not in response to new scientific developments, but indirectly through the world of business. During the 1980s, as the burgeoning biotechnology industry became increasingly responsible for research funding, 118 scientists and other stakeholders developed a more commercial and capitalistic understanding of how HGGM might be used. Rather than a collective responsibility, DNA itself was conceptualized as a material resource. 119 At the same time, scholars were presented with a readymade model of commoditized reproduction. The first commercial sperm bank opened in Minneapolis in 1970. 120 Although sperm freezing had been possible for decades, this was the first time that it had been distributed through a company rather than within the doctor\u2010patient relationship. By the end of the decade, the three most important sperm banks had all opened in California, and frozen sperm would supplant \u201cfresh\u201d stocks entirely with the advent of the AIDS crisis. 121 As a result, authors in the HGGM debate may have found it more relevant to allude to the kind of aesthetic choices that parents were making in the real world, such as selecting sperm donors with a particular skin tone, hair color, eye color, and height. 122 Most physicians also expressed willingness to select sperm based on IQ and education. 123 Ironically, the aesthetic focus of the fertility industry developed indirectly from Muller\u2019s plans for the betterment of society. Robert K. Graham, his one\u2010time partner in the Repository for Germinal Choice, was an old\u2010school eugenicist, but he noticed a pattern in his clients\u2019 questions. As journalist David Plotz observed, \u201cSure, sometimes his applicants asked how smart a donor was. But they usually asked how good\u2010looking he was. And they always asked how tall he was. Nobody, Graham saw, ever chose the \u2018short sperm\u2019.\u201d 124 By sending recruiters to gather donations from physically attractive men, and listing them in an ad\u2010like catalog, Graham turned the Repository into a model for the rest of the industry. 125 These preferences were likely carried over into the HGGM debate as it looked increasingly to the wishes of individual couples. Other new reproductive technologies were also gaining attention in the early 1980s. IVF was becoming widely accepted, 126 surrogacy was making headlines, 127 and physicians had become increasingly open to sex selection. 128 Indeed, the number of American geneticists willing to diagnose or refer patients for sex\u2010selective abortions rose from 1% as of Roe v. Wade to 62% by 1989. 129 Like eye and hair color, sex selection was often considered a psychological slippery slope to other discretionary uses of genetics. 130 In contrast with the emphasis on genetically modified men in the early debate, sex selection also foregrounds the possibility of female designer babies, and the idea of using reproductive technologies for beauty, complexion, and coloring plays into common stereotypes of femininity. 131 Finally, the phrase \u201cdesigner baby,\u201d which entered popular culture in the 1980s, 132 may have reinforced the idea of parents choosing aesthetically fashionable traits for their children. 133 5 CONSEQUENCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOETHICAL ARGUMENTS The decrease in references to moral enhancement and increase in references to cosmetic modification do not mean that authors came to value the latter more, or even that they found it more ethically intriguing. No papers or books have been devoted specifically to the ethics of genetically modifying babies\u2019 eye or hair color, as there have been for other increasingly mentioned traits like athletic enhancement. 134 Authors who discuss potential uses of HGGM have simply begun to include cosmetic modifications more frequently in their work, even if they are simply reciting them in a list. One way to explain this is a shared schema: an \u201cabstract knowledge structure\u201d of the relationships between different concepts that helps us store, retrieve, and fill gaps in our information. 135 Schemas can include stereotypes like nerd, jock, or untrustworthy politician. 136 They guide our expectations of which categories should be associated with which traits and vice versa. Since schemas are based on experience, and there were no genetically modified people until very recently, expectations about their traits had to come from other exposures, 137 such as the work of previous authors, genetics research, associations with other reproductive technologies, or even science fiction tropes. The literature on HGGM suggests that stakeholders prior to the 1980s associated the category of genetically modified people most strongly with the traits of health, intelligence, and morality\u2014and often with maleness\u2014whereas recent scholars have a slightly different schema that includes more physical modifications. This is not to suggest that other components of the schema remained identical; while intelligence has remained the paradigmatic example of genetic enhancement, specific images associated with it have changed over time. Participants in the early debate often agreed that humans would need to be intellectually upgraded to meet the increasing complexity of modern civilization 138 or to perform research into greater and greater enhancements. 139 As the debate narrowed, most authors began to focus on more conventional desires like success in education and career. However, the shift of cosmetic modification into the central schema and moral enhancement out of it has likely had deeper effects on the bioethical conversation. This process has encouraged the development of different kinds of arguments about HGGM, and it also suggests different images of the technology\u2019s future social context. In several important ways, moral enhancement and cosmetic modification are similar: from a Rawlsian perspective, neither are usually viewed as primary goods that parents might be expected to guarantee for their children in a neutral state. 140 While viewed as enhancements by some authors and not by others, both are also agreed not to be therapeutic. 141 Yet moral and cosmetic modifications are associated with mostly different ethical issues. Setting aside general objections like unequal access, the former raises fears of easy exploitation, restricted freedom, circumventing character development, political stagnation, loss of behavioral diversity, prejudice against the unenhanced, and the enforcement of a single view of morality. 142 Fewer authors have specifically discussed attractiveness, but they point out issues such as cultural, racial, and gendered beauty standards, loss of physical diversity, envy, and simply being a waste of money. 143 As a result of these concerns, stakeholders tend to view cosmetic modifications much more negatively than moral enhancements. Proponents of moral enhancement have generally considered it a contribution to human flourishing, despite occasionally praising the role of aggression in political change or resistance to dictatorships. 144 But while making someone more compassionate or less aggressive is typically presented as a benefit to those around them, modifications to appearance and other physical traits are usually seen as benefits to nobody or as \u201cpositional goods\u201d that make the modified person\u2019s peers worse off. 145 Moreover, since aesthetic changes are more likely to reflect parents\u2019 individual tastes, they may not even be considered attractive in other cultures. Cosmetic applications have routinely been the least popular use of HGGM in polls of the general public, 146 who criticize them as superficial. 147 Although some authors remain open to cosmetic modifications, most of these have merely tolerated them on the basis of reproductive liberty. 148 Only a handful directly endorse aesthetic enhancement through HGGM: Francesca Minerva has suggested that it might reduce social discrimination against people with unattractive face shapes, 149 while James Watson more vulgarly remarked that making \u201call girls pretty\u201d would be \u201cgreat.\u201d 150 Thus, it seems that cosmetic references joined the central schema while being actively encouraged by only a small minority of stakeholders. The strongly negative valence of cosmetic modification could create a starker contrast between different categories of HGGM, giving authors a stronger example of misuse against which to define therapeutic applications. 151 Perhaps the 1980s\u2019 ethical realignment from the germline/somatic distinction to the therapy/enhancement one was successful partly because enhancements were seen negatively as personal preferences rather than positively as helpful improvements to morality. Another ethical corollary of the move toward bodily changes like cosmetic appearance, athletic ability and disease resistance involves the commonly discussed \u201cnonidentity problem.\u201d First posed by Derek Parfit, it asks whether it could be wrong to have a child with some impairment if avoiding that impairment would mean creating a different child altogether. 152 Emotional characteristics tend to be more closely associated with human nature, 153 and psychology studies find that people usually see changes to morality as the most likely to affect personal identity. 154 In contrast, the most common example of cosmetic HGGM in recent writings is eye color, which has been cited in numerous philosophy papers as precisely the kind of shallow change that would make no difference to a future person\u2019s identity. 155 As LeRoy Walters and Julie Palmer wrote, physical enhancements \u201cmay seem to be less threatening to the essence or central core of a human being.\u201d 156 Besides their direct implications for the identity of genetically modified people, these intuitions could influence some stakeholders\u2019 perceptions about the physical and social risks of different types of HGGM. The third major way in which this shift may have affected the bioethical debate is through its implications for the imagined context of HGGM. Moral enhancement is generally agreed to be a more distant prospect 157 than better\u2010characterized physical changes. As such, the move away from more \u201cscience fictional\u201d plans toward choices similar to those made in the existing fertility industry suggests that HGGM should be considered as part of contemporary society. On the one hand, this draws necessary attention toward the existing social structures and parental motivations associated with assisted reproductive technologies. On the other, this tendency could make authors less willing to consider HGGM in the context of broader social, cultural, or technological changes, or to anticipate issues as distant as species divergence. For instance, cosmetic modification may reinforce the idea of HGGM as a market good within liberal democracy. Authors advocating moral enhancement have often imagined that the government would facilitate it, but cosmetic modifications are likely to be excluded from healthcare funding. 158 Most recent writings assume they would be permitted by a laissez\u2010faire government or that the state would only intervene to protect citizens against unethical uses of HGGM. 159 Authors writing after the switch from moral to cosmetic modification also focus less on civilization as a whole and more on jurisdictional conflicts between existing nation\u2010states, such as reproductive tourism. 160 Finally, cosmetic images of HGGM suggest that its purchasers might be white. Except for the cover of a 2015 report by the Center for Genetics and Society, 161 illustrations of genetically modified babies are almost universally light\u2010skinned. While reform eugenics implicitly took the white middle class as its audience, 162 this racial imagery for HGGM may have continued through the influence of the fertility industry. From the outset, assisted reproductive technology was accessed most frequently by middle\u2010class white couples, with more white specialists to consult and more white gametes available. 163 Graham\u2019s influential Repository never successfully recruited any Black or Asian donors, nor did any Black women ever apply for sperm. 164 These trends may have inadvertently reinforced the image of the designer baby as a Caucasian, for whom the choice between many different hair and eye colors would not be out of place. The common example of parents choosing blond hair and blue eyes 165 even evokes white supremacist uses of HGGM. Beyond restricting the imagined time frame of the debate, the move towards cosmetic images of HGGM may also suggest that it will take place for well\u2010off white couples in Western democracies, although it has yet to be seen whether the 2018 He Jiankui affair in China will affect future representations of the technology. 6 CONTINGENCY AND THE PROBLEM OF UNDEREXPLORED TRAITS Acknowledging our shifting mental images of genetically modified people in previous decades leaves us with the question of how those images might continue to change in the future. The idea that people at different points in history might value different genetic traits is a long\u2010running ethical concern in HGGM. At a practical level, genetic modifications that seem beneficial today could hinder our descendants in a changing environment. 166 HGGM might also obstruct societal change by cementing the arbitrary preferences of a particular generation. 167 John Mackie commented that Victorians might have chosen to design \u201cpatriotic and pious\u201d children, 168 while Paul Root Wolpe facetiously asked, \u201cWomen in the early twentieth century were supposed to be delicate and to faint at the sight of blood; why not select for those desirable traits?\u201d 169 But if these schemas can change over time, then we may not simply value traits differently from other generations; in fact, we may not even bring the same traits to mind in the first place. 170 Opponents of HGGM often quote C. S. Lewis\u2019 1943 essay \u201cThe abolition of man,\u201d which argues that the power to \u201ccondition\u201d future generations would mean putting them in thrall to whichever random confluence of \u201cheredity, digestion, the weather, and the association of ideas\u201d influenced the original conditioners\u2019 plans. 171 Given the shifting pattern of influences discussed in this article, it is easy to see how some plausible uses of HGGM might have been excluded from the debate simply based on historical chance. One indication of this arbitrariness is that the range of characteristics seen as genetic has changed dramatically over time. Although mainline eugenicists focused on a shortlist of important traits, 172 they also attempted to establish Mendelian inheritance patterns for a vast catalog of characteristics. Many of these were obviously rooted in social norms: a frequently mocked example is thalassophilia, the inclination to sail around the world. 173 Charles Davenport\u2019s Individual Analysis Cards also covered traits like daydreaming, patriotism, and ability to take a joke. 174 Scientific advances around the time of World War II, such as Beadle and Tatum\u2019s discovery of the link between genes and enzymes, temporarily shifted geneticists\u2019 focus to medical conditions whose etiology could be clearly demonstrated. 175 Yet, starting in the 1990s, many of the behavioral traits first investigated during the eugenics era began to receive renewed media coverage due to the discovery of purported candidate genes. 176 Examples like perfect pitch began to appear regularly in the HGGM debate, but most of these traits did not. 177 The content of contemporary discussions has clearly been influenced by scientific discoveries, but the modifications we think of do not correspond directly to what we know about the human genome. There is no clear philosophical reason for why authors frequently write about creating mathematical or musical prodigies 178 while avoiding traits like anorexia, income level, political affiliation, promiscuity, PTSD, risk taking, and smoking, all of which have been examined in genome\u2010wide association studies or marketed to the public in direct\u2010to\u2010consumer tests. 179 Scholars who do mention modifications outside of the typical shortlist often do so while imagining the consequences of overlooking those traits in future people. Jonathan Glover, who helped to rehabilitate some of Muller\u2019s work in the 1990s, 180 thought \u201cone of the worst imaginable\u201d outcomes of HGGM would be leaving out \u201cwarmth\u201d or a sense of humor. 181 Anderson questioned whether we might inadvertently destroy our capacity for spirituality, 182 a topic which once interested eugenicists 183 and was central to the breeding experiment in John Humphrey Noyes\u2019 Oneida Community. 184 Many other examples that appear only rarely in the discourse are physical, including blood type 185 and low odor production. 186 Some involve provocative new powers, like built\u2010in biosensors, 187 ability to eat cellulose 188 or glowing in the dark. 189 Some are gendered, like menopause, 190 breast size, 191 or ability to achieve orgasm. 192 A few are associated with race, like epicanthal folds, 193 hair texture (common in advertisements for donor gametes) 194 and removal of the allele for \u201cAsian flush,\u201d which has appeared in journalistic coverage of preimplantation genetic diagnosis 195 but not in the HGGM debate. Finally, it is striking how often scholars discuss height compared to weight, given the latter\u2019s prominent role in social perceptions and the fact that weight maintenance is the second\u2010most investigated trait in twin studies. 196 In comparison to the move from moral to cosmetic modification, it is not clear why most of these traits have been comparatively neglected. Many raise unique and interesting bioethical issues that could represent an important opportunity for future research. 7 CONCLUSION When speculating about the ethics of HGGM, scholars have discussed only a limited set of potential modifications. This list is not intrinsic to human psychology or Western culture but reflects several interlinked historical influences. Prior to the 1980s, the HGGM debate was largely shaped by reform eugenicists and theologians, many of whom used a long\u2010term, societal perspective that favored enhancements to social behavior. As they lost their jurisdiction to molecular geneticists and bioethicists, the discussion became increasingly restricted to the preferences of individual families. Stakeholders who considered HGGM from the context of reproductive autonomy found it easy to discuss traits from the burgeoning commercial fertility industry, like height or coloring, without considering deeper changes to identity or long\u2010term developments in society. Knowing that the kinds of modifications we discuss can change over time could help us to put old and new arguments into better context, by understanding how stakeholders with different knowledge bases imagined abstract categories like enhancement or how they pictured potential users of HGGM. It also presents new opportunities for bioethical analysis. Considering past influences on the set of traits that authors imagined changing with HGGM may enable us to anticipate future developments in the debate through greater attention to jurisdictional conflicts between disciplines, preferences in donor gamete use, and large\u2010scale societal transformations. For instance, Francoise Baylis concluded her recent book by speculating that climate change might result in increasing attention to collective benefit in the HGGM debate. 197 We also need to decide which traits to prioritize in continuning discussions of HGGM. Should we start by considering precedent in the bioethics literature, perceived feasibility, potential impact on human life, level of public demand, or perceived ethical complexity? As CRISPR and related technologies continue to develop, a broad and proactive conversation about which modifications we discuss could help us respond to a more diverse range of bioethical issues than we are currently equipped to face.

Derek So is a PhD candidate in Human Genetics at McGill University\u2019s Centre of Genomics and Policy, supervised by Profs. Yann Joly and Rob Sladek. His project examines the germline gene editing debate and the conceptual frameworks we use to imagine hypothetical people\u2014particularly that of the \u201cmodular\u201d human, in which discrete characteristics are combined like building blocks. He is also interested in drawing on psychology, religious studies, and science fiction to improve descriptive ethics in this area. Derek previously received a BSc in Biology and English Literature and an MSc in Human Genetics and Bioethics, both from McGill."
