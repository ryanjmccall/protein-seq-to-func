  "abstract_text": "To identify transcriptionally regulated genes potentially involved in the effect of shear stress on endothelial gene expression, we performed a differential display analysis of mRNAs from human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) exposed to laminar shear stress (12 dynes/cm2) in comparison to HUVEC maintained in static condition. We identified a cDNA fragment overexpressed by laminar shear stress. The full-length, SSK1, was 3653 long and encoded for a novel protein of 1050 amino acids. Northern blot demonstrates that SSK1 mRNA is expressed at high levels also in placenta, a weak transcript was present in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. Homology searches of the protein databases showed that SSK1 is related to numerous serine-threonine kinases. The highest homology was found with a very recently described gene, BUBR1, an analogue of BUB1, which is a kinase involved in the regulation of cell cycle. The most conserved residues in catalytic domains II, III, VIb, VII, VIII and IX of serine-threonine protein kinases were found in the C terminal region of SSK1 which further supports the kinase nature of the new protein. The putative serine-threonine kinase SSK1 may represent a tool by which mechanical forces regulates phosphorylation events within endothelial cells.",
