    "abstract_text": "The tsBN462 cell line, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant isolated from the hamster cell line, BHK21/13 has a ts defect in G1 progression and belongs to the same complementation group as the ts13 cell line. We cloned human cDNA which can complement both tsBN462 and ts13 mutations, from the cDNA library of the secondary ts+ transformant (K-1-1) of tsBN462 cells using, as a probe, the isolated human X chromosomal genomic DNA. The cloned DNA is 5.3 kb long and has an open reading frame of 4662 bp, encoding a protein of 178,768 daltons. The putative protein is hydrophilic with a tandem repeat of 120 amino acids in the C-terminal region. An amino acid sequence (PPKKKRRV), similar to the consensus sequence for the nuclear translocation signal, is located immediately before the tandem repeat of amino acids.",
