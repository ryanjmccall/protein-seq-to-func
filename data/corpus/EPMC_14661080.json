  "abstract_text": "We found that a subject with Cockayne syndrome type A was a compound heterozygote for two new mutations in CKN1 (MIM 216400): a missense mutation (A205P) and a nonsense (E13X) mutation. We also identified and characterized a new common single nucleotide polymorphism in CKN1 in five groups.",
