  "abstract_text": "<h4>Aim</h4>To study the effect of maternal pre-eclampsia on cord plasma leptin concentrations in preterm infants.<h4>Methods</h4>Leptin concentration was analysed in cord plasma of 74 preterm infants, gestational age 24 to 32 weeks. Of these, 14 were born to pre-eclamptic mothers, in 10 intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was present, and 59 had been exposed antenatally to corticosteroids.<h4>Results</h4>The mean (SD) concentration of cord plasma leptin was 1.31 (0.88) microg/l. A significant correlation was found between leptin concentration and gestational age (r = 0.336; p = 0.0037). Leptin levels were higher in infants of pre-eclamptic mothers (p = 0.0007), in those with IUGR (p = 0.0005), and in infants exposed antenatally to corticosteroids (p = 0.02). In multiple regression analysis, leptin was associated with gestational age and maternal pre-eclampsia (both p < 0.05), but not with antenatal corticosteroids.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Increased fetal leptin in maternal pre-eclampsia may reflect a physiological adaptation to fetal stress such as hypoxia.",
