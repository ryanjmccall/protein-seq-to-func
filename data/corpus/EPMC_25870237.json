  "abstract_text": "IL-7 is a key homeostatic cytokine that provides signals for T cell survival and proliferation in vivo. In this article, we provide evidence that IL-7 utilization is enhanced by a novel mechanism of cytokine \"recycling\" during which T cells treated with rIL-7 are rapidly induced to express p-STAT5 and are subsequently able to recycle biologically active cytokine for release to neighboring cells in soluble form. Our observations indicate that the ability of cells to recycle IL-7 is dependent on IL-7R α-chain (CD127) and endocytosis, consistent with a model whereby IL-7 is internalized via receptor interactions before recycling. These observations provide evidence of a novel mechanism that enables cells to optimally use IL-7.",
