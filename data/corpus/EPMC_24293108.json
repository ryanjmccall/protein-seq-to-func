In this study, we have studied the relationships between the mRNA expressions of A-type lamins, LMNB1 and LBR and the clinicopathological parameters in human breast cancer. Samples of breast cancer tissues (n = 115) and associated non-cancerous tissue (ANCT; n = 30) were assessed using reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. Transcript levels were correlated with clinicopathological data. Higher levels of A-type lamins and LMNB1 mRNA expression were seen in ANCT. Higher lamin A/C expression was associated with the early clinical stage (TNM1 vs. TNM3 - 13 vs. 0.21; p = 0.0515), with better clinical outcomes (disease-free survival vs. mortality - 11 vs. 1; p = 0.0326), and with better overall (p = 0.004) and disease-free survival (p = 0.062). The expression of LMNB1 declined with worsening clinical outcome (disease-free vs. mortalities - 0.0011 vs. 0.000; p = 0.0177). LBR mRNA expression was directly associated with tumor grade (grade 1 vs. grade 3 - 0.00 vs. 0.00; p = 0.0479) and Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI1 vs. NPI3 - 0.00 vs. 0.00; p = 0.0551). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest such a role for A-type lamins, lamin B1 and LBR in human breast cancer, identifying an important area for further research.",
