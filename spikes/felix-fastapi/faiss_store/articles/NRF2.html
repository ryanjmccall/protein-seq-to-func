<h1>NRF2</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in cellular defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. It regulates the expression of a wide array of cytoprotective genes involved in antioxidant response, detoxification, and metabolic regulation. Activation of NRF2 has been associated with enhanced stress resistance and extended lifespan in multiple model organisms, positioning it as a key player in the biology of aging and longevity.</p>
