# Protein Sequence-to-Function Knowledge Base (protein-seq-to-func) üß¨‚û°Ô∏è‚öôÔ∏è

**Project:** West Coast Vectors Team Submission for the OpenLongevity HackAging.ai Hackathon (October 2025)

**Challenge:** [Sequence-to-Function Track](https://www.hackaging.ai/challenges/sequence-to-function/)

## üéØ Project Goal

This project aims to address the bottleneck in longevity research caused by critical protein sequence-to-function knowledge being locked away in unstructured scientific literature. We built an AI-powered pipeline to automatically extract these relationships, create a queryable knowledge base, and synthesize accessible summary articles for researchers, focusing initially on the C-C Chemokine Receptor family (CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, CCR7) and their role in inflammaging.
