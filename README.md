# protein-seq-to-func
West Coast Vectors team submission for HackAging project: https://www.hackaging.ai/challenges/sequence-to-function/

Data Engineer (The Source):

Mission: Get the raw materials.

Tasks: Write and run the Python scripts to scrape/download data from the target databases (GenAge, UniProt, etc.). Place all raw data into the /data/raw directory.

ML / NLP Engineer (The Engine):

Mission: Build the "brain" of the project.

Tasks: Develop and train the core model that reads scientific papers (mined by the Data Engineer) and extracts the key sequence-to-phenotype relationships. This is the primary NLP task.

Data Analyst / Bioinformatician (The Insight):

Mission: Make sense of the extracted data.

Tasks: Take the messy output from the ML model, clean it, structure it into the final knowledge base, and analyze it. Find the key patterns and insights that will be used in the final presentation.

Project Lead / Strategist (The Storyteller):

Mission: Steer the ship and create the final story.

Tasks: Keep the team aligned with Andrei's strategic guidance. Manage the project, merge code, and be responsible for building the final, compelling presentation and demo that showcases the team's work.
